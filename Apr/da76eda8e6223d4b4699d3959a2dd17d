He prefers playing in the Twenty20 leagues across the world, a format in which he is nearly 2,500 runs clear of his nearest rival and former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum. MUMBAI - West Indies batsman Chris Gayle proved he remains a bowlers' nightmare after becoming the first player to reach 10,000 runs in Twenty20 cricket during Royal Challengers Bangalore's victory against Gujarat Lions in the Indian Premier League on Tuesday.The 37-year-old went into the match having failed to make any significant contribution for his franchise in the ongoing season which led to him being dropped from the playing XI.The left-handed opener came in as a replacement for the injured AB de Villiers against Gujarat and blasted a 38-ball 77, which included five fours and seven sixes, to set up Bangalore's 21-run win.&quot;People are still looking out for Chris Gayle. The Universe Boss is still here and still alive,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;It was great fun. You know it's good to be back.&quot;I wanted this so badly, but first of all to get 10,000 runs, it was actually on my mind, so I'm glad to get that sort of achievement.&quot;It's a privilege to actually be the first person to get there.&quot;Gayle's last appearance in a Test match has been three years back while he last played an one-day international for West Indies in March, 2015.He prefers playing in the Twenty20 leagues across the world, a format in which he is nearly 2,500 runs clear of his nearest rival and former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum.&quot;He'll hang his hat on that, as he should,&quot; Australia batting great Ricky Ponting told the Cricket Australia website (cricket.com.au).&quot;He's played more T20 cricket in the last five or six years than he has other forms of the game, but he's dominated the game pretty much everywhere he's been.&quot;Gayle has scored 13 Test hundreds with a top score of 333 and 22 centuries in 269 ODIs for West Indies.&quot;I just want to thank the fans and all the franchises where I have actually played around the world,&quot; Gayle added.&quot;Even playing for West Indies as well. At the end of the day, they have actually played a part in this 10,000 runs as well.&quot;It has been fantastic and like I said still I have a lot more to offer to the fans. Hopefully, I can keep entertaining and get a few more thousand runs under my belt.&quot;
