JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) in Gauteng has announced it will hold a picket outside National Treasury next Friday and not a protest after its march to the capital was declined by the City of Tshwane.The SACP had initially planned to march to Treasury last week but was forced to postpone the demonstration.Last week, the party's national body announced its calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down following the recent Cabinet reshuffle.The SACP held a briefing in Johannesburg on Wednesday following its provincial council meeting.Provincial secretary Jacob Mamabolo explained: We decided on a picket and not a protest march to avoid National Treasury s deliberate sabotage of our protest march as it happened last Friday. In a picket we do not require National Treasury s abuse of power to decline the receipt of our memorandum. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
