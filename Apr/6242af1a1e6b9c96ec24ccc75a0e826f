I am not in this job to make friends with anybody. I have the responsibility to run this city that I have inherited with massive challenges corruption, as you are aware. The City of Johannesburg reached a stage where it was no longer corruption, it was state looting. It was the looting of state resources and that s not going to happen under my watch.
