The SCA has ordered all the parties to liaise with each other to determine a date upon which the appeal is to be heard. CAPE TOWN The parties involved in a court battle surrounding the live-broadcasting of the trial of murder-accused Henri van Breda will have to resolve the matter before next week.Van Breda, who's facing multiple charges for the murders of his parents and brother, and an attack on his sister, is expected back in the Western Cape High Court on Tuesday.The accused and the National Director of Public Prosecutions have been granted leave to appeal a High Court ruling granting Media24 permission to live-stream his trial.With his trial resuming on Tuesday, there is little time left for an appeal to be heard before the Supreme Court of Appeal.The SCA has granted van Breda and the NDPP leave to appeal as a matter of urgency against the High Court ruling. The court last month granted Media24 permission to install two cameras in the courtroom - with certain conditions - to record and broadcast proceedings.The SCA has ordered all the parties to liaise with each other to determine a date upon which the appeal is to be heard.If a consensus is not reached, then the application will be placed before the president of the court for the determination of a date.
