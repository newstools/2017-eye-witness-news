An Ipid investigator states that there&#8217;s a high probability that Lieutenant General Phahlane is using his office &amp; authority to undermine their investigation. PRETORIA - Police union Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) has called on Acting National Police Commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane to step down pending the finalisation of a corruption investigation. Police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) filed fresh papers in the High Court on Thursday, which revealed numerous suspicious vehicle transactions as well as large cash payments to contractors working on his house. Phahlane approached the court to have a search warrant which was used to secure a surround sound system installed by a South African Police Service (SAPS) service provider declared unlawful and invalid. An Ipid investigator states in an affidavit that there s a high probability that Lieutenant General Phahlane is using his office and authority to undermine their investigation. Popcru s Richard Mamabolo says it would be prudent for Phahlane to step aside for the time being. Mr Phahlane should consider stepping down so there s no interference until the matter has been resolved. While the Democratic Alliance has called on Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to suspend the top cop, the minister s office has declined to comment, saying this is an ongoing matter before the courts.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
