Now I just say, 'Okay, what can I do?' That is a question we can ask ourselves and then act upon.&quot; The Canadian activists have drawn attention to indigenous people who have been marginalised after decades of public silence and apathy, Amnesty said.The grassroots Idle No More movement has helped mobilise indigenous people to take control of their lands, resources and environment, and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society has waged a legal battle against underfunding of social services for indigenous children, Amnesty said.The awards will be presented in Montreal, Canada, on 27 May.
