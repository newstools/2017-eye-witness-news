First minister Nicola Sturgeon says an early poll would give Scotland a chance to re-enforce its mandate for choice on its future. LONDON - Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described Theresa May's call for an early election as a huge political miscalculation.Sturgeon says an early poll would give Scotland the chance to re-enforce its mandate for choice on its own future.May wants the election to take place on 8 June, saying her government has the right plan for negotiating the terms of Britain s exit from the European Union and she now needs political unity in London.The UK had not been due to face a general election until May 2020 but, with her ruling Conservative Party enjoying a record lead in the polls, it's thought Theresa May saw a snap election as being too good an opportunity to miss.Officially, she argues the stances of Britain's opposition parties risk the country's ability to make a success of Brexit, with the danger of government business grinding to a halt during EU negotiations.May holds a parliamentary majority of just 17 but current predictions suggest that figure could rocket after June 8, considerably strengthening May's bargaining position.
