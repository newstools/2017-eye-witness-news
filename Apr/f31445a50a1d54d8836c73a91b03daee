The SAPS, Tshwane Metro police and private security have been employed to make sure the march does go on and that it goes on in a peaceful manner. Masango says he doesn t understand why they would be attacked, especially if their demonstration seeks to better the lives of South Africans. We are civilians, not politicians and non-partisan. We are just South Africans saying we ve had enough of the status quo and state capture.
