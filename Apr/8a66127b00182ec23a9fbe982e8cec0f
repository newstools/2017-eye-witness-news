This will include implementing a lifeline water supply which would involve minimal water pressure and even harsher restrictions. CAPE TOWN The City of Cape Town has started to plan for the worse case scenario should dam levels drop below 10% of storage levels.This will include implementing a lifeline water supply which would involve minimal water pressure and even harsher restrictions. Mayco member for Water and Waste Services Xanthea Limberg says the city will install water management devices for those who do not limit their consumption, even if they are already paying the maximum for water.The City of Cape Town says it's already started activating a number of emergency water measures including water extraction from the Table Mountain Aquifer. A small-scale wastewater reuse plant at the Zandvliet water treatment works which will be able to produce 10 million litres of high-quality drinking water for the central and southern suburbs, will cost R120 million.A small-scale desalination plant is also under consideration.Limberg says: All households must reduce consumption further. If each person can use around 100 litres a day we d achieve our target. Dam levels are now at a critical 26.2% and the city estimates that there are only around 100 days of usable water left.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
