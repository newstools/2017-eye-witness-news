Blade Nzimande says ANC's alliance partners must be cautious not to make a mistake of starting anti-Zuma campaigns. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary Blade Nzimande says while the African National Congress' alliance partners have called on President Jacob Zuma to step down, they must be careful not to start anti-Zuma campaigns.Nzimande issued the warning while addressing Cosatu's Gauteng shop stewards council in Johannesburg earlier on Thursday. He says the current political developments have led both Cosatu and the SACP to reach a decision that the president must step down; a decision he says wasn t easy. The issue we re dealing with, which makes Cosatu and SACP to take these decisions, is deeper than an individual. Nzimande says ANC's alliance partners must be cautious not to make a mistake of starting anti-Zuma campaigns. A mistake which was partly done with President Mbeki ... and what happened? We are almost back to where we were 10 year ago. He says Cosatu and the SACP must focus on the fundamental problems, which he says include transforming the country economically and stopping the looting of the state by what he says are parasites.#CosatuGP SACP GS Blade Nzimande now on podium.
