Eskom&#8217;s Khulu Phasiwe says reports that the nuclear build programme has virtually been given the go ahead are incorrect. JOHANNESBURG Eskom says no time frame has been set for bidders to step forward in the nuclear build programme as it s still considering whether the process is feasible.On Sunday, the City Press reported it was in possession of a document stating that the power utility will in June this year issue a formal request for proposals from bidders.There have been concerns that the country simply cannot afford the programme.Eskom s Khulu Phasiwe says reports that the nuclear build programme has virtually been given the go ahead are incorrect. We re not anywhere near the requests for proposals. We re currently dealing with request for information which is going to the end of this month. He says claims that the project will cost R1 trillion also have no basis. The reason why you go for a tender process is that the price will be determined by the market, nobody knows at this stage how much this project is going to cost. Phasiwe says that once the request for information process is completed at the end of this month, a decision on whether a formal request for proposals should go ahead will be made.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
