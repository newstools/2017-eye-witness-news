The MK Veteran&#8217;s national steering committee says the ANC of today does not embody the values of the generation of Ahmed Kathrada and other stalwarts. JOHANNESBURG - The MK Veterans national steering committee says the African National Congress (ANC) of today does not embody the values of the generation of Ahmed Kathrada and the likes of other stalwarts.The committee held a media briefing at the Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, saying it s concerned about the current situation in the country, particularly within the ANC.It says it s also concerned about the economy due to the downgrade to junk status.The committee has called for an urgent national consultative conference to try and correct what they call the crisis within the governing party.Mkhonto we Sizwe veteran Siphiwe Nyanda says they are concerned at the unprecedented events of recent weeks, including mass marches and divisions in the ANC s top six.Nyanda paid his respects to late struggle stalwart Kathrada, saying his values and those of many others who fought for the country s liberation are lacking in today s ANC. These are the values that we stood and fought for and that s why we re here because we realise that the ANC is straying a bit from those values. The national council steering committee has called for the cancellation of the ANC s policy conference, and says a consultative conference is urgently needed.At the same time, the committee says those who have been protecting Luthuli House are abusing the uniform. Who are these young people that we see at funerals, birthdays and other places? Nyanda says the committee has been asking itself this very question. He says anyone parading in military uniform saying they are protecting or guarding any building is not a genuine MK soldier. We don t even have the capacity to provide any security for any establishment because we don t bear arms, we can t bear arms legally and so on. He says the security of Luthuli House is the responsibility of the South African Police Service.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange and Refilwe Thobega)
