Virgin Active South Africa spokesperson Les Aupiais says complaints and suggestions about transport have to come from the staff. JOHANNESBURG Virgin Active South Africa spokesperson Les Aupiais says they do not provide transport for staff who knock off late at the gym.This was in response to a caller on Talk Radio 702 who raised her concern about workers at Virgin Active in Midrand at Vodaworld who leave work after 9pm and don t have transport.Mpho Leseka said gym staff have to walk about three kilometres to the nearest taxi rank after work because Virgin Active does not provide transportation for those who work late at night.Aupiais says complaints and suggestions have to come from the staff.&quot;If we talk about a solution to late night transport then it [must] come from staff. We encourage them to come up with solutions. We can t impose something that might not work.&quot;The spokesperson says it s a complex and challenging issue because a lot of the gyms are in high traffic areas.&quot;We have 140 clubs around the country and a lot of them are built in high traffic areas.&quot;Aupiais added that they have never received any reports from staff who have been mugged and sexually abused on their way home.
