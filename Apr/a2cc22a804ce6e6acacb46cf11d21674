Preliminary referendum results gave a narrow 51.4% approval for the biggest overhaul of Turkey&#8217;s political system. JOHANNESBURG - Turkey's main opposition party has now filed a court appeal against a decision by electoral authorities to accept unstamped ballot papers in the tightly contested referendum granting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wide new powers.Preliminary referendum results gave a narrow 51.4% approval for the biggest overhaul of Turkey s political system, since the modern state was established nearly a century ago, but opposition parties insist the poll was deeply flawed.Erdogan, a populist with a background in once-banned Islamist parties, has ruled since 2003 with no real rival, while his country emerged as one of the fastest-growing industrial powers in both Europe and the Middle East.He has also been at the centre of global affairs, commanding NATO s second-biggest military on the border of Middle East war zones, taking in millions of Syrian refugees and controlling their further flow into Europe.Critics accuse him of steering Turkey towards one-man rule and exacerbating divisions that could increase instability. The two largest opposition parties both challenged Sunday's referendum, saying it was deeply flawed.(Additional information by Reuters)
