MKMVA chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe says there must be something wrong with former President Thabo Mbeki if he is calling on ANC MPs to vote with opposition parties in the vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. JOHANNESBURG - Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe says there must be something wrong with former president Thabo Mbeki if he is calling on African National Congress (ANC) Members of Parliament (MPs) to vote with opposition parties in the vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.Parliament is expected to debate the motion next week Tuesday.Mbeki has called on MPs to put the country's citizens first.But Maphatsoe says MPs are merely in Parliament as a result of their party choosing them to represent them. We are worried that our former president, who we loved, can say that ANC members must vote with opposition parties that used to oppress us. Mbeki has written an exclusive article for The Star newspaper in which he implores MPs to act as a voice of the people and not that of their political parties.The former president says the current controversy in the ANC has imposed on the country the opportunity and obligation to better define the constitutional and moral relationship between people and their representatives.Mbeki says he agrees with a previous Constitutional Court ruling, clarifying that MPs serve in Parliament as representatives of the people.Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete has until this afternoon to file her response to the Constitutional Court on why she believes next week's vote of no confidence vote must not be a secret ballot.LISTEN: Worth it or not: ANC veteran comments on no confidence vote(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
