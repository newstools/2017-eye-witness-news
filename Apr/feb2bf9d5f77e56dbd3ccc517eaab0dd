On the question of Hawks Head Berning Ntlemeza, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says he doesn&#8217;t have an appetite for court battles. PRETORIA - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says while he still needs to be briefed on the court cases involving Hawks Head Berning Ntlemeza, he is not in the business of dragging out matters through the courts. Mbalula was speaking after being officially welcomed to the police by Acting National Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane in Pretoria West on Tuesday. The High Court recently re-affirmed a ruling that he was not fit and proper to be the head of the Hawks, that Ntlemeza lied under oath and lacked integrity. On the question of Ntlemeza, Mbalula says he doesn t have an appetite for court battles. I m not intending to allow this issue to drag on and on in a case that s clearly not winnable in the court of law. Mbalula says he wants to focus on crime fighting. I m not in the business of fighting such cases. My interest is to get down, knuckle down and fight and get police force on board in relation to that. The minister met with his predecessor on Tuesday.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
