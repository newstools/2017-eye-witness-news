A toxicology report, however, showed traces of Aldicarb had been ingested.The City's JP Smith says an environmental health and law enforcement raid at Philippi train station on Friday found several traders selling illegal poison.One of these was Aldicarb, also known as &quot;two step&quot;, a highly toxic pesticide that was banned more than 15 years ago. [Aldicarb is] extremely dangerous and should not be used by anybody. They might be highly effective, but they re also indiscriminate and pose a great risk for families. The city will be taking further steps against the vendors in terms of national legislation relating to the control of pesticides and poisons, as well as the violation of city by-laws.Smith says they believe aldicarb had been added to the Samora Machel family's food before it was served.
