The DA s Mabine Seabe says members will march to the Limpopo Treasury today in a demonstration against state capture. And this march will be going through the streets of Polokwane towards the provincial Treasury. As we talk now, the Limpopo provincial government is on the brink of bankruptcy and economic stagnancy and this is directly an outcome of the ANC s mismanagement of funds and capture of various institutions in the province.
