National and the Free State leaders will address an assembly of party members on the National Working Committee's decision to support President Zuma. JOHANNESBURG - National and the Free State African National Congress (ANC) leaders will address an assembly of party members on Thursday on the National Working Committee (NWC)'s decision to support President Jacob Zuma. The Cadres Assembly is taking place in Sasolburg. The NWC decided to back President Zuma after he reshuffled his Cabinet without adequately consulting the ANC, leading to three of the party's top six publicly expressing unhappiness with the changes to Cabinet.ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe indicated last week that the party s NWC would deploy leaders to provinces to explain the body s decision to back Zuma. The national leaders expected are NEC members Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Fikile Mbalula, Nathi Mthethwa, David Mahlobo and Naledi Pandor. Free State general secretary William Bulwane says every province will hold such assemblies. We must explain our position and support for the president of the country to the branches as well as the reasons behind the Cabinet reshuffle. The leaders are also expected to explain why the president fired Pravin Gordhan as finance minister and used the intelligence report as one of the reasons for axing him.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
