The minister will be announcing the interventions he is going to be making to try and resolve or stabilise the concerns that they have brought up. ECONOMISTS REACT WITH SHOCKEconomist at Argon Asset Management Thabi Leoka says it's bad news for the country.&quot;This is the breaking point and it really is up to politicians and up to South Africans to decide whether we are going to take 12 years or two years to come out of this situation we are in. Nedbank's Isaac Matshego says there s been a lot of policy confusion in government over the past few years which is finally catching up. There is this talk about radical economic transformation which, unfortunately, is not very clear what it means. What we need is macro-economic stability, even in the African National Congress s economic transformation document. The rand fell by as much 2% to the dollar on Monday evening in response to the news of that downgrade, while government bonds also weakened sharply.
