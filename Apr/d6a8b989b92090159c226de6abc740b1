A statement by the army said the incident in the eastern Deir al-Zor province proved that Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked militants &quot;possess chemical weapons&quot;. SYRIA - The Syrian army said an air strike late on Wednesday by the US-led coalition hit poison gas supplies belonging to Islamic State, releasing a toxic substance that killed &quot;hundreds&quot;, but the coalition denied carrying out raids in the area.A statement by the army, flashed on Thursday by Syrian state TV, said the incident in the eastern Deir al-Zor province proved that Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked militants &quot;possess chemical weapons&quot;.The report could not immediately be independently verified.US Air Force Colonel John Dorrian, a spokesman for the coalition, said it had carried out no air strikes in that area at that time.&quot;The Syrian claim is incorrect and likely intentional misinformation,&quot; he said in an email to Reuters.The United States launched cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase last week, in response to a deadly poison gas attack in the west of the country that Washington blamed on President Bashar al-Assad's government.Syria and its ally Russia deny Damascus carried out any such chemical attack. Moscow has said the poison gas in that incident belonged to rebels.The US strike on the Syrian air base was the first time Washington has deliberately and directly targeted the Syrian government. It is separately waging an air campaign against Islamic State in eastern Syria.
