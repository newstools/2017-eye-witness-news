The Gujarati Network in South Africa has encouraged its members to boycott the family's religious event set to be hosted outside the Gupta compound. JOHANNESBURG The Gupta family has reiterated that it will take legal action against the Gujarati Network if their week long religious event is in any way disrupted.It s understood the Gupta family is sponsoring buses, meals and entertainment for hundreds of people attending the event over the eight-day period.The Gujarati Network in South Africa has encouraged its members to boycott the family's religious event set to be hosted outside the Gupta compound in Saxonwold.But the Guptas s lawyer Gert van der Merwe says he got the impression that there are efforts to disrupt the event by the network. I also recall that there were positive efforts to disrupt the meeting in, for instance, contacting the people who would appear at these proceedings. He says if any damages are incurred by the family as a result of the network, he will consult the courts. If that happens one would obviously consider launching an urgent application in the form of an interdict, or if necessary if there are any damages flowing from that we will institute an action in the form of a summons. Van der Merwe says the event is a fairly open event that anyone can attend and says it is unfortunate that there are such objections.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
