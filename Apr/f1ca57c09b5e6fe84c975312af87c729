Following heavy downpours on Sunday night, flash floods wreaked havoc in some areas. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Environmental Affairs Department says it is too early to determine what impact recent rainfall in the Central Karoo will have on the dam levels.Following heavy downpours on Sunday night, flash floods wreaked havoc in some areas.The Meiringspoort Pass was temporarily closed to traffic as a result of flash floods.A woman is still missing after the vehicle she and three others had been travelling in, was swept away.An ambulance crew and patient travelling from Klaarstroom to Prince Albert hospital are unharmed after their vehicle was washed away by the inclement weather.The Western Cape Environmental Affairs Department's James Brent-Styan says while they're concerned about the flash floods, it's hoped that the recent rain will bring some relief to the province's dam levels. Every little bit helps. They important thing is the rain needs to fall in the catchment areas as it leads to our dams and rivers. According to the City of Cape Town, dam levels have declined to 25,2% (storage levels), which is 1,1% down from a week ago. With the last 10% of a dam s water mostly not being useable, dam levels are effectively at 15,2%. Consumption over the past week is 742 million litres per day, which is 42 million litres above the collective usage target of 700 million litres per day.The City has thanked residents who continue to save water, however, it has warned residents not to relax their water saving efforts following recent rainfall.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
