A court ruling has set aside intergovernmental agreements signed with Russia, South Korea, the US, France and China. CAPE TOWN - The Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa (Necsa) says a court ruling finding processes related to government's nuclear procurement invalid and unconstitutional will not affect the continuation of the programme.The corporation and Eskom are jointly responsible for developing the country's nuclear capacity.Necsa chairperson Kelvin Klemm says Wednesday's judgment of the Western Cape High Court finding in favour of Earthlife Africa Johannesburg and the South African Faith Communities Environmental Institute was not a vote against nuclear power.The Nuclear Energy Corporation serves as an advisor to the Energy Minister.Klemm says he's surprised by this week's court ruling that set aside intergovernmental agreements signed with Russia, South Korea, the US, France and China. I find it strange that we might have to do public participation on whether or not we are using feet and inches or millimetres and centimetres. He says the ruling does not impact on the technological aspects of building new power stations. We see this as a pothole in the road. Klemm says it's untrue that the invalid nuclear agreements will lead to a multi-billion rand secret deal.
