Would he do better? I'm not sure,&quot; Clichy told the reporters.&quot;If the club is spending more money and they have the players they need, then perhaps Wenger is the perfect man.&quot;You always want something new when you are used to something and what you get is probably most of the time not better ... so you have to be careful what you wish for.&quot;Arsenal, who drew 2-2 with Manchester City at the weekend and have gone three league games without a win, are in sixth place, seven points behind City in fourth but with a game in hand.
