UDM leader Bantu Holomisa is threatening to go to court if MPs are not allowed to vote by secret ballot in the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma. PARLIAMENT - United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa is threatening to go to court if MPs are not allowed to vote by secret ballot in the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma.Holomisa says he wrote to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete on Thursday, asking for a response by 10am on Friday. A previous court bid by Agang SA to allow for a secret ballot failed, but Holomisa says he believes there are good grounds for a court to favourably consider such a request this time around.The UDM has given Mbete an ultimatum.Holomisa said: &quot;Today we have reminded her, sent another letter, saying if you don t respond by 10 o clock on Friday morning we ll seek a legal remedy.&quot;Holomisa says Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza s reported threats that African National Congress (ANC) MPs would be removed if they voted in favour of the motion against President Zuma make it necessary to have a secret ballot.ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu has also spoken out against threats against ANC MPs, labelling them &quot;unfortunate&quot;.He says his caucus members will toe the party line but he also says they re under intense pressure to back the bid to topple Zuma.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
