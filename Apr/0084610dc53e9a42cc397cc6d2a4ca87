This follows the DA, whose leader tabled the motion, made official request to reschedule the 18 April debate, while the UDM and EFF made their requests on Tuesday. JOHANNESBURG The Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete has decided to postpone the debate and vote on the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.Parliament has granted the request after the Democratic Alliance (DA), which brought the request for a no confidence motion, officially supported the petition for the vote to be pushed back.On Tuesday, the United Democratic Movement and Economic Freedom Fighters requested Mbete to postpone the debate after the Constitutional Court issued dates for parties in the matter to file relevant documents.The postponement of the motion, which was scheduled to take place on 18 April, will be referred to the National Assembly Programme Committee for its consideration. The DA's Mabine Seabe said: The programmes committee will meet after the constituency period when Parliament comes back to ensure that this motion is again rescheduled. The committee will be requested to reflect on the implications of the postponement on the programme of the House in terms of Rule 90 - which states that postponed motions remain on the programming system of the Assembly, thus blocking any Member of Parliament from tabling a similar motion until the one tabled is debated and voted on.
