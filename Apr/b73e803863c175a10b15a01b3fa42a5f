Youth league secretary Thanduxolo Sabela has rubbished this, saying Khoza is seeking attention. Dr Makhosi Khoza in recent history is known for her singing to the gallery, she wants to portray herself as the super revolutionary at the expense of the ANC. In a Facebook post, Khoza said: If you re a leader of society you ve got to listen to the diverse views of the society, no matter how painful they may sound. I think we ve to as the ANC. She said the party s leadership has to stop and listen to the people who marched against Zuma last week.The MP added that there is simply no way out for the ANC in the confidence motion against President Zuma. Whether we vote for or against, both ways the ANC loses and both ways it s going to dent significantly its status as a leader of society. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
