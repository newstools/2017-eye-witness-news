Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says his advisor Chris Malikane merely provides technical advice and as minister he is ultimately left to make the decisions. PRETORIA - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says people shouldn t be concerned by the controversial public comments made by one of his advisors. The minister was referring to Professor Chris Malikane who penned a column in a weekend newspaper in which he advocated for the nationalisation of banks and mines and attacked so-called white monopoly capital. Treasury issued a statement on Tuesday, distancing itself from Malikane s views, saying government remained committed to its current economic path. Gigaba says Malikane merely provides technical advice and as minister he is ultimately left to make the decisions. The technical advice he provides will never detract from the policies of the African National Congress. Gigaba says he s spoken to Malikane about the issue. Don t be agitated by Professor Malikane. Of course, I have advised him to keep quiet and allow me to do my work. I cannot be the spokesperson to my advisor. The minister leaves on Wednesday to attend a meeting of the International Monetary fund and World Bank in the United States.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
