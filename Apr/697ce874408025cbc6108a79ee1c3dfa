NEW YORK - The Tribeca Film Festival has kicked off in New York with a programme that is examining the current political climate in the US under President Donald Trump.Co-founded by Robert De Niro in the wake of 11 September attacks, the festival has always been political in nature but it is doubling down now that Trump is in office.De Niro has been vocal about how much he dislikes Trump, even saying he d like to punch him in the face.Trump s 100th day in office on 29 April falls during the festival, which is now in its 16th year.Many of the documentaries programme deal with issues that have come to the fore during Trump s administration, including equality and immigrants rights.The festival organisers say they feel a responsibility to both entertain audiences and address populist unrest that pushed Trump to the White House.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
