We are thrilled with the responses we are receiving from prospective team owners. No doubt this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for both bidder and city, CSA CEO Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. While the level of private investment we expect will be new to South African sport, we are also very interested in the level of expertise that owners will bring to all levels of the game in South Africa. There are 11 prospective venues open to the eight competing teams, with the sought-after stadiums in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Durban to go to the highest bidders. The eventual location of these franchises will be up to the bidders and the cities who see the opportunities to generate brand value and economic activity through the league, Lorgat said.
