The citizens who did manage to make it on Friday saw it as an opportunity to make their voices heard. CAPE TOWN - After a late-night Cabinet shuffle that saw the removal of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, the South African public took to social media in protest and a call to action.Khumbaya my lord, khumbaya This simple spiritual song was sung on Friday morning at the opening of the #OccupyTreasury protest in front of Parliament. The song s appeal? A call to God to come and help those in need. In a similar tone, President Jacob Zuma once said that the ANC will rule until Jesus comes. In the mean time, the country has a cross to bear and unfortunately, because of the last-minute announcement and hasty planning, the protest was emptier than a Western Cape dam.On Thursday night, while the country watched Twitter, whispers of taking action started to be tweeted 140 characters at a time. The calls came after Zuma affected one of the biggest changes to cabinet since 2009 by appointing 10 new ministers. The biggest upset? Replacing Gordhan with Malusi Gigaba. Save SA called on South Africans to take to the streets in an effort to #OccupyTreasury, and the turnout, while enthusiastic, was rather empty to start with.The citizens who did manage to make it on Friday saw it as an opportunity to make their voices heard on a variety of related topics pertaining to government that are becoming more and more frustrating.Let s take a look. Who wants to spit on this statue? A citizen who was either on his way to work, or on the way back, invited the public to spit on Louis Botha s statue with him while his laptop rested against it.Then there was this guy.
