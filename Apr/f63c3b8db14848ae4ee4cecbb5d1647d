Lungisa Fuzile said he would be stepping down after Pravin Gordhan was removed as Finance Minister. JOHANNESBURG - The National Treasury has confirmed the imminent departure of Director-General Lungisa Fuzile.He had indicated that would be staying on for some time in order to ensure a smooth handover.Fuzile said he would be stepping down after Pravin Gordhan was removed as Finance Minister.Meanwhile, the rand and the banking index have come under severe pressure with the local currency losing 1.5% over the past few hours.The index is down by over 3% on the JSE.The local currency has dropped around R1.50 to the dollar over the past week and a half following the Cabinet reshuffle and the decision by ratings agency S&amp;P Global to downgrade the country's credit rating.The rand and banking index have lost more ground since African National Congress secretary-general Gwede Mantashe told the media on Wednesday that the party's leadership had rallied around President Jacob Zuma.The index inflicted major losses in December 2015 when Nhlanhla Nene was fired.Economists say financial institutions are now also under pressure, with concern that the index may fall further.WHAT FUZILE'S DEPARTURE MEANS FOR TREASURYFuzile says that he had already asked Gordhan to leave the Treasury in the middle of May before Malusi Gigaba took over at the finance ministry.He had been seen as crucial to maintaining stability at the Treasury after Gigaba replaced Gordhan as minister.He says his departure, and that of Gordhan, should not necessarily lead to the Treasury changing its mandate.During a press conference on Saturday, Fuzile had already indicated that he might be preparing to leave the Treasury because he had been there for such a long time. I have done six years in May. I will be owing just one year relative to both my predecessors because they each did seven years. Fuzile's decision means the current finance minister will now be able to select a new director general to replace him.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
