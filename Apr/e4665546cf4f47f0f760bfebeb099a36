Striking social workers and auxiliary workers are apparently responsible for the mayhem at Gauteng child and youth care centres. JOHANNESBURG - The National Health Education &amp; Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) says it will continue with its strike, until the Social Development Department meets its demands for better salaries and working conditions. The union claims Minister Bathabile Dlamini has reneged on many occasions on her commitment to have a meeting to discuss a way forward, since the start of the strike in March. Striking social workers and auxiliary workers are apparently responsible for the mayhem at Gauteng child and youth care centres, blocking entrances and preventing food and medication from being delivered.Nehawu s Khaya Xaba said, Many operations have been frustrated by the strike but it does not mean we cannot exercise our constitutional right. We will not stand idly while we notice that the department is not giving workers what is due to them. Meanwhile, the department confirmed late in March that six-months-old Singalakha Sonamazi died after being moved to an NGO as a result of the ongoing strike.She was among 90 children who were transferred from government care facilities to NGOs around the country.
