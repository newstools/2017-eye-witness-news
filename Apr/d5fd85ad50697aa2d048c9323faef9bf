Magwaza has filed an affidavit citing his side of the story, saying Dlamini&#8217;s affidavit contains factors that are inaccurate. JOHANNESBURG South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) Chief Executive Officer Thokozani Magwaza has disputed Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini s claims in her initial affidavit to the Constitutional Court motivating why she should not be held personally liable for the social grants payment debacle.Magwaza has filed an affidavit citing his side of the story, saying Dlamini s affidavit contains factors that are inaccurate.The minister earlier filed papers to the highest court in the land stating that Magwaza and Sassa are to blame for the social grants payments debacle.Magwaza says he does not want to talk on record about the papers he has filed to the court.In the affidavit which is now deemed as taking on Dlamini head on, Magwaza says in retrospect, it was the minister who was determined that an internal solution will not be found. He adds that it then transpired that the minister was against the utilisation of the local banks and post office.Dlamini had earlier filed an affidavit putting the blame on Sassa and stating that she had engaged with the agency to find an amicable solution.Contrary to that, Magwaza s affidavit disputes that Dlamini engaged Sassa to consider available options to ensure that social grants were paid subsequent to the termination of the contract with Cash Paymaster Services.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
