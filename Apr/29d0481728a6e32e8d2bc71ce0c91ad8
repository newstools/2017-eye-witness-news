Now we feel the political landscape and all that will impact the fiscal story and there s a higher risk of budgetary slippage. Deputy Reserve Bank Governor Daniel Mminele says the downgrade is a major setback. However, he says the monetary policy committee remains ready to respond if need be. Mminele says it s too early to draw conclusions about whether recent political developments will represent re-assessment or re-pricing of South Africa s credit.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
