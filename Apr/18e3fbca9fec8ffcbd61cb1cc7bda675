JOHANNESBURG - Outgoing Treasury director general Lungisa Fuzile says he believes his imminent departure from the finance ministry shouldn t necessarily lead to the National Treasury changing its mandate. Fuzile confirmed on Wednesday he wants to leave in the middle of May and says he first asked then finance minister Pravin Gordhan if he could leave last week.Fuzile s position has been closely watched by investors as Malusi Gigaba takes control of the ministry. Fuzile says Treasury officials are competent highly skilled professionals, and that their commitment and diligence is not attached to a minister and as a result they ll stay on under Gigaba. But Econometrix chief economist Azar Jammine says markets are not going to like this development. This move will raise suspicions of the capture of National Treasury by parties that want to enable Treasury to embark upon spending without the constraints of worrying about the implications. Fuzile also says Treasury staff will ensure they protect the fiscus and continue with a policy of sound financial management.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
