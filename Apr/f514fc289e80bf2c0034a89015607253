HARARE - Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai has signed a second pact with an opposition leader ahead of elections in Zimbabwe next year.Tsvangirai has agreed to work with Welshman Ncube, the leader of a smaller MDC party that broke away 12 years ago.Ncube was a founding member of the MDC, but in 2005 serious disagreements caused him and other senior members to split from Tsvangirai s party.The split votes that followed may have cost Tsvangirai victory in presidential elections three years later.On Thursday, the two agreed to put aside their differences and work together ahead of next year s elections.Tsvangirai says the agreement with Ncube is a first step to undoing the damage they did to themselves.On Wednesday, Tsvangirai signed a similar agreement with ex-vice president Joice Mujuru and her National People s Party in a deal that caused some excitement in the Zimbabwean media.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
