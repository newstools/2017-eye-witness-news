Officers swooped on his offices in Sandton on Friday with a warrant, attempting to raid O'Sullivan's property, but there was a standoff with his staff. JOHANNESBURG Police are searching for private investigator Paul O'sullivan's laptop, tablet, hard drives and phones. Officers swooped on his offices in Sandton on Friday with a warrant, attempting to raid the property, but there was a standoff with his staff. O Sullivan is out on bail after being arrested for fraud, intimidation and extortion. He has accused Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane of trying to obstruct his investigation. The investigator says he flew out to London on Thursday night with the laptop and phones the police are looking for. They are looking for my laptop and my cellphone, and I am speaking to you from my cellphone. Unless they want to hop on a plane and come to London, where they won t be allowed to carry out such stupid warrants, they have come empty handed. O Sullivan says he believes acting commissioner Phahlane is behind the raid and dirty cops are being used. I think what is most important is their mannerisms and how they think they can get away with this.
