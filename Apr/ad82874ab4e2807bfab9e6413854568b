General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says the trade union federation no longer has confidence in President Jacob Zuma. JOHANNESBURG - The rand has extended its recovery after Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) called on President Jacob Zuma to resign. General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says the trade union federation no longer has confidence in Zuma.BREAKING #Cosatu call&#39;s on President Jacob Zuma to step down. &quot;We don&#39;t believe he is right to unite, lead ANC&quot; CMCosatu made the call shortly before midday, in the wake of S&amp;P's downgrade of South Africa to junk status.Moody s followed suit by announcing just a few hours later that it too has put the country on review for downgrade.#Cosatu Ntshalintshali says for 1st time under Pres Zuma, they were not consulted about #CabinetReshuffle. CMCosatu says as the African National Congress (ANC)'s alliance partner, they can't ignore controversies involving the president.Ntshalintshali says the time is now for Zuma to leave. This, combined with the alleged undue influence that is apparently exerted by the Gupta family in the office of President Zuma and a series of controversy surrounding the president, like the Constitutional Court judgment and his apology on Nkandla, Cosatu no longer believes that the president is the right person to unite and lead the movement. He says the ANC must elect a new leader to take over in the ruling party. After all his undeniable contribution to both the government and the movement, the time has arrived for him to step down and allow the country to be led by a new collective at government level.
