The Energy Department has announced that from 5 April, the price of 95 octane will decrease by 24 cents a litre while diesel is going down 10 cents a litre. JOHANNESBURG - The Automobile Association (AA) is warning this week's decrease in the petrol price could be short-lived, due to the recent political developments. The Energy Department has announced that from 5 April, the price of 95 octane will decrease by 24 cents a litre while diesel is going down 10 cents a litre. However the AA's Layton Beard says there's reason for caution. Local political developments will always have an impact on the rand-US dollar exchange rate. As we ve seen in the last couple of days the depreciation of the rand has been quite significant. And I think because of that if this depreciation continues into April the outlook for the petrol price in May does look pretty bleak. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
