Two months ago the league marched to the Absa Towers in Johannesburg demanding the bank repay money apparently transferred from the Reserve Bank. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) says it plans on visiting Absa again, after the bank failed to respond to the league's memorandum on the Public Protector's report on a bailout during apartheid.Two months ago, the league marched to the Absa Towers in Johannesburg demanding the bank repay money apparently transferred from the Reserve Bank.A leaked preliminary report into the debt found that Absa may need to repay R2.2 billion.The ANCYL s Mlondi Mkhize says they initially gave Absa 21 days to respond to their memorandum but they still haven t received a reply. Given the fact that they ve decided to deliberately not even indicate if there s any undertaking they re doing on their part, we d then be visiting them to solicit a response. Mkhize says should they not receive a reply, the league will take the necessary steps to get to the bottom of the matter.The Public Protector s office has since said it is waiting for feedback from all implicated parties in the report.WATCH: ANCYL demands that Absa 'pay back the money'(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
