On Sunday, Zille was charged for allegedly violating the party s Federal Constitution over her tweets about colonialism.Following a visit to Singapore and Japan last month, she tweeted that colonialism had some benefits and was not all bad. The ANC s Western Cape spokesperson Yoneka Diko says the DA should have instituted more stringent action against Zille. What s important is that they ve missed an opportunity to show the nation that praising colonialism, colonialism being the worst crime ever committed against the Africa continent, they don t appreciate the gravity of that. At the same time, Zille is set to appear before the DA s Federal Legal Commission over her colonialism tweets which sparked outrage.She will remain in her position as Western Cape Premier pending the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings.The DA s Federal Legal Commission has found Zille has a case to answer in relation to her tweets regarding colonialism.Zille s tweets caused a social media outcry last month after she tweeted that colonialism had some benefits.Party Leader Mmusi Maimane says Zille s subsequent responses to her comment will also form part of the case against her. The initial referral was supplemental on 22 March 2017 to include references to a series of comments made publically and on social media that have exacerbated and amplified the original tweet. When the matter was debated in the Provincial Legislature last week, Zille denied having defended or justified colonialism or apartheid.Three members of the Federal Legal Commission will chair the disciplinary proceedings.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
