CAPE TOWN - Anti-rhino poaching organisation Rhino Disharmony has stressed the importance of intensifying public awareness around poaching. Several high profile artists and musicians performed at a concert in Cape Town on Thursday night to highlight the plight of the rhino. Internationally renowned pianist Tian Jiang was among those performing. The pieces that I ve chosen are among the many on my own original competition. The pieces have a very theatrical dramatic... that s their fighting spirit. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
