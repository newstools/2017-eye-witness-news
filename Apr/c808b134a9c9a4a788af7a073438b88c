PRETORIA - Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan has strongly criticised the Gupta family and their media network for orchestrating a campaign to malign himself, his former deputy Mcebisi Jonas and democratic institution in South Africa.Gordhan was speaking at the Treasury offices in Pretoria on Friday where he and Jonas said goodbye to staff.Gordhan never mentioned his detractors by name, but it was clear he was referring to the Gupta family. Why must we constantly deal with people who are never seen in the public domain but they mastermind all these attacks on family, make false accusation, pay somebody called Bell Pottinger, PR firms are hired and millions of rands are spent to do what? To malign democratic institution of South Africa. He says they went too far. You can t have fake news and Twitter accounts attacking family members who have nothing to do with the Treasury. You want to attack the two of us? Go ahead. Gordhan says he now hops to lead a normal life, but will stay on as a Member of Parliament.
