Kgosana, which the De Waal Drive Municipality is in the process of being renamed after, died at the age of 80 in Pretoria on Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - Cape Town mayor and former Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) member Patricia de Lille has paid tribute to late PAC stalwart Philip Kgosana, whom she describes as a principled man.The municipality is in the process of renaming De Waal Drive after Kgosana following a request from former Cape Times editor Tony Heard.Kgosana died at the age of 80 in Pretoria on Wednesday after a short illness. De Lille says Kgosana was an unsung hero of the struggle. As a very young man, only 23-years-old, he led 30,000 demonstrators on the march from Langa to Cape Town and that s why we want to remember him by naming the De Waal Drive [after him] because that is the route they used.
