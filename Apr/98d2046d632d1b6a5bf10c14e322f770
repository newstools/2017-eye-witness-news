We re not a junk country, we have a junk president and we ll remove junk so South Africa can prosper. The South African Communist Party (SACP)'s Solly Mapaila has reiterated the communist party's call for Zuma to resign. He s handed over the sovereignty of our country to the Guptas. We mandated him to lead through the elections, now he has abdicated his responsibilities. Because of that we can no longer have confidence in him on the basis of who takes decision for the interest of our public. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
