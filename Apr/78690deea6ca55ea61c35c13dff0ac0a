JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) presidential contender Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma appears to have referred to the Save SA protests on Friday as rubbish . She was responding to a Twitter conversation in which Treasury spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete said the Save SA protests were well-funded.Another person then said it s mind-blowing how many resources their privilege affords them. Dlamini-Zuma then said: &quot;This is what they are protecting... hence some of us are not part of this rubbish. They must join us for the march for our land they stole... Dlamini-Zuma has now deleted that tweet.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
