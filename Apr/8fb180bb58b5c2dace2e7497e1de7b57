The ANCYL&#8217;s Thanduxolo Sabela has described the DA supporters who marched against President Zuma as thieves who stole the land. DURBAN The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) has vowed to fight for the ruling party until the bitter end, and has urged those calling for the president to step down to stop provoking them.Provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabela led a march from the Durban CBD toward the beachfront not far from where the Democratic Alliance (DA) had earlier been demonstrating.The league says it wanted to confront the anti- Zuma protesters to question what he has done to them.KZN police have confirmed the clashes between the DA and ANCYL in Pietermaritzburg but no arrests have been made.The struggle song dubul ibhunu (shoot the boer) was banned by Equality Court s judge Collin Lamont in 2011 when the now Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema sang it at a rally.But this did not stop Sabela, who has described the DA supporters who marched against President Zuma as thieves who stole the land. In fact, these white people who stole the land should be locked up in jail because they are thieves who stole the land.&quot;The thousands of supporters moved from the Durban beachfront back to the Durban CBD where they occupied an Absa branch there demanding for the billions stolen to be returned.
