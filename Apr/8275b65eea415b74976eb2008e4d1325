ANC members made their message clear on Wednesday: they support President Zuma and still believe in his leadership. JOHANNESBURG - As thousands of people prepare to march to the Union Buildings against President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday, his supporters in Westonaria say they love the president and will be celebrating his 75th birthday with him. Dozens gathered at the Afri-Park in Westonaria and he promised them a bright future. Wednesday will mark a second anti-Zuma march in just six days. ANC members made their message clear on Wednesday: they support President Zuma and still believe in his leadership. One man says Zuma is a great leader and will stay as president until his term comes to an end. We believe in Zuma. He is our president we are going to protect him. We love him. Another resident says South Africans who are calling for him to step down are unfair. Hands off our president, we ve had enough now. On Monday, Zuma said the marches against him - which took place on Friday - showed that racism is still rife in the country; a comment that has sparked outrage among some South Africans, saying the president is playing the race card.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
