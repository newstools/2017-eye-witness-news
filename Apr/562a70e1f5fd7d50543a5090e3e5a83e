It mustn t darken the good game. Chiefs boss Steve Komphela, who beat Mosimane for the first time in his current position, says people can't allow their emotions to get the better of them. As a couch and colleague I wish to apologise. We know football is a game of motions and we must try our utmost best to stay calm.

Chiefs boss Steve Komphela, who beat Mosimane for the first time in his current position, says they had to be relaxed under pressure. You don t come play against Sundowns and think it s going to be easy. It wasn t and you could see their quality when they were in possession. Their thinking and playing was clear, their desire to get to the midfield and dominate so we needed to stay calm. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
