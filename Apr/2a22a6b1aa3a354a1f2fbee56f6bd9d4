Political analyst Prince Mashele questioned the legacy that black leaders will leave in the years to come if the ANC does not self-reflect. DURBAN - Political analyst Prince Mashele says the looting that can be seen by the African National Congress (ANC)-led government shows how the party has no conception or vision of a modern society.Mashele was speaking at the launch of Dr Khulu Mbatha's book Unmasked: Why the ANC Failed to Govern.Mbatha has questioned the use of slogans used by the ANC, which he says are often not clearly defined. I also see no rationale in claiming you re involved in a national democratic revolution when actually the ANC is in power who are we fighting against? Ourselves? Mashele says: The party that has a modern conception of society does not look at itself first its starting point is society and asks what kind of society do we want to create? What is it that we must put in place in society? Mashele compared governance under the British colonialists, the apartheid regime and the current government and has questioned the legacy that black leaders will leave in the years to come if the ANC does not self-reflect.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
