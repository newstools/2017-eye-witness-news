JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize has given his first response to President Jacob Zuma's removal of Pravin Gordhan from the finance ministry, saying he has his reservations about the process that was followed.He also says the way President Zuma spoke to the ANC's top six leaders gave the distinct impression that the ANC is no longer the political centre.In response to requests for comment about President Zuma's reshuffle, Mkhize says that unlike previous consultations about reshuffles his briefing this time around was different.He says it gave the impression the ANC was no longer the political centre, and that the leadership collective had been deprived of its responsibility to advice on political matters.Mkhize also says this comment is in no way meant to undermine the prerogative of the president to make changes to his cabinet.But he says this is to ensure such decisions can be owned, justified and defended by the party's leadership collective.WATCH: Pravin Gordhan: this is why I was firedBut Mkhize says the capability of each of these newly appointed cadres is acknowledged.Mkhize also says the ANC needs to admit there are several serving minister whose performance is unsatisfactory, and the ANC leadership cannot justify to be seen to have ignored these factors in a reshuffle.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
