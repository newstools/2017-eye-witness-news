IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he has discouraged the DA from marching to the ANC headquarters because this will be seen as a provocative act. DURBAN Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) president Mangosuthu Buthelezi says South Africa is at a crossroads and the current crisis will have deep repercussions.Buthelezi says leaders of opposition parties met in Johannesburg on Monday, where they discussed how to avert a disaster as a result of what he says is the president failing the country.The IFP leader has strongly discouraged mass action and has instead called for other avenues to be explored first.Buthelezi says he has discouraged the Democratic Alliance from marching to the African National Congress (ANC) headquarters, Luthuli House, because this will be seen as a provocative act. When believing itself to be under siege, the ANC will close its ranks and any ANC leader who may have begun listening to their conscience will listen to the louder voice of what they see as eminent danger. The IFP leader says the country must allow things to play out before taking decisions based on emotions. The IFP supports mass action, of course, we support the call to march to the Union Bulidings as suggested. But we believe that mass action should be the last resort as we have not yet seen the results of the request to the speaker of Parliament. The IFP leader has called for calm and for a rational approach, emphasising that whatever happens next could see the loss of life.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
