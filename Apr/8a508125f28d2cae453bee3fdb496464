Its Pizza Hut franchise has 188 branches across the continent.&quot;Let's be prudent because in Africa there may be some levels of instability and also when you are opening some routes that take time,&quot; Ewan Davenport, General Manager of Pizza Hut Africa, said.&quot;But the sky is the limit. At the moment, we are looking at (opening) at least 50 stores a year.&quot;Western retailers are increasingly targeting Africa, which is home to rising consumer spending and some of the world's fastest growing economies, albeit off a low base.
