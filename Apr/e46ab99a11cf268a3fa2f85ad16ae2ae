The two attended the same school and the Canadian PM recently offered the actor a rematch. CANADA - Former Friends star Matthew Perry has rejected an offer to fight Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The actor revealed last month he went to the same elementary school as the 45-year-old politician and after the Canadian recently offered Perry a rematch, the 47-year-old star has politely declined the offer over Twitter.Writing on the micro-blogging site, Trudeau said: &quot;I've been giving it some thought, and you know what, who hasn't wanted to punch Chandler? How about a rematch @MatthewPerry? (sic)&quot;I&#39;ve been giving it some thought, and you know what, who hasn&#39;t wanted to punch Chandler? How about a rematch @MatthewPerry?But Perry has since responded, saying: &quot;I think I will pass at your request for a rematch kind sir (given that you currently have an army at your disposal) (sic)&quot;Perry first revealed the story during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, in which he said he and his friend Chris Murray acted out of &quot;pure jealousy&quot;.WATCH: Matthew Perry says he beat up Justin Trudeau at schoolHe admitted: &quot;I have a story about him that I'm not proud of.&quot;My friend Chris Murray, who was also in the fifth grade in Canada, reminded me that we actually beat up Justin Trudeau. We both beat him up.&quot;I think he was excelling in a sport that we weren't [as good at]. It was pure jealousy, and, you know, we beat him up. His dad [Pierre Trudeau] was prime minister, but that wasn't the reason we beat him up. I think he was the only kid in school that we could beat up.&quot;Perry also claimed the incident set the wheels in motion for Justin to grow up wanting to be prime minister.He said: &quot;I'm not bragging about this. This was terrible. I was a stupid kid, and I didn't want to beat him up. In fact, I think at some point I tried to turn it into love-play. &quot;But I think it was rather instrumental in him going to such great heights and becoming prime minister. I think he said, 'I'm going to rise above this, and I'm going to become prime minister.'&quot;
