The National Sea Rescue Institute has advised beachgoers in the Southern Cape to be cautious when in the water following an increase in shark sightings inshore. CAPE TOWN - The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has advised beachgoers in the Southern Cape to be cautious when in the water following an increase in shark sightings inshore. The increase in the number of sharks close to shore is part of the normal aggregation of the animals. Sharks, as they've done in previous years, move inshore to take advantage of naturally occurring prey like seals and fish. Most of these shark sightings are in the vicinity of Robberg. The NSRI's Craig Lambinon says: We re urging bathers and paddlers to be aware that there are increases in shark sightings inshore, particularly along the Southern Cape coast.
