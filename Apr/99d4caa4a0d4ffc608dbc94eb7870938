The KwaZulu-Natal Cosatu says transformation of the economy should be a holistic systemic shift and not merely a change in the face of the Treasury. DURBAN - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) says the recent Cabinet reshuffle is a bluff and government cannot pretend that a second radical phase of transformation is now underway. The regional held a briefing earlier on Wednesday, where it gave the outcomes of its Central Executive Committee meeting.The KZN Cosatu says transformation of the economy should be a holistic systemic shift and not merely a change in the face of the Treasury.Cosatu's KZN provincial secretary Edwin Mkhize says Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba will still be running the very same Treasury that excludes workers from the economy. The government of the ANC cannot deal with issues of radical transformation in terms of just changing faces of individuals. Mkhize says they will not be participating in this Friday s mass action. We can only take to the streets when the doors of engagement are shut and we don t think that s the case with the ANC. The KZN Cosatu office was ambiguous in responding to questions around why they have only decided to engage President Jacob Zuma after making calls for him to resign first.Mkhize says their only issue is how Zuma went about his Cabinet reshuffle by not consulting the federation.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
