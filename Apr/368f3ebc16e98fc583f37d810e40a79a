DA leader Mmusi Maimane says his party's planned march near Luthuli House won't have an impact on the internal dynamics of the ANC. JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says he doesn't believe his party's planned march in the Johannesburg CBD near Luthuli House on Friday will help unify the African National Congress (ANC). He says his march is going ahead after a provincial leader of the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association said on Wednesday he would send 600 people to defend the ANC's headquarters. But the group's national leader Kebby Maphatsoe says they will not use violence and will only defend Luthuli House itself, and allow DA members to protest in their own space.Maimane says this march won't have an impact on the internal dynamics of the ANC. Whether we march there or not, they would ve protested Jacob Zuma because it s a pertinent network, an organisation driven with a sense that they would protect the Guptas with everything.
