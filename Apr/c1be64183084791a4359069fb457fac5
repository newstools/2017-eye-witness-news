Public Enterprises Minister Lynn Brown has denied any knowledge of the payout to former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe, saying it is an operational issue. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling for former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe s alleged R30 million payout to be investigated, saying it s unacceptable that taxpayers money is repeatedly used to benefit underperforming executives.According to the Sunday Times, the golden handshake was paid out to Molefe by the power utility in March, following just 18 months at the helm.Molefe resigned from Eskom last year after details of his relationship with the Gupta family were revealed in the Public Protector s State of Capture report.The DA has written to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to look into the matter.Shadow Minister for Public Enterprises Natasha Mazzone says: &quot;What we re asking is that the Public Protestor must investigate what we think is a highly irregular payout in order to establish on what basis Mr Molefe deserves to receive this amount of money.&quot;Public Enterprises Minister Lynn Brown has denied any knowledge of the payout to Molefe, saying it is an operational issue.There are conflicting explanations for the payment, as it is described as a pension payout in one document and a severance cost in another document seen by the paper.Molefe would have had to earn a yearly gross income of R146 million to have a pension of R30 million paid to him.Asked for comment by the paper, Molefe says he has been paid what is due to him.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
