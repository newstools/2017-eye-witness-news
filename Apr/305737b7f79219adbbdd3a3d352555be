The DA says according to reports, SAPS is using sketchy security threats to justify the presidential protection to Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will be writing to the Public Protectors office, asking for an investigation into why Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is receiving VIP protection, even though she is neither a member of Parliament nor Cabinet. The opposition party says according to reports, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula is using sketchy security threats to justify the presidential unit s protection of the former chairperson of the African Union. The SAPS have refused to elaborate on details around the decision. The DA's shadow minister of police Zakhele Mbhele said, There s questions of accountability here and whether the rule of law has not been compromised or undermined. At the same time, Cope says the use of the presidential protection unit to guard Dlamini-Zuma is nothing but a cover up for corruption and illegal activities. The party says this is the use of taxpayers money to pay for resources to encourage her presidential campaign. The former AU chairperson was driven and escorted to an African National Congress meeting in Sasolburg last week by the presidential protection unit s.Cope's Dennis Bloem said, Solly Mapaila of the SACP was also in danger and he went to the police to lay a charge against people who wanted to kill him. Now we are asking whether he will also get protection from the presidential unit? (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
