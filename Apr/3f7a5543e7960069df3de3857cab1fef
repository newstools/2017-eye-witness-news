The DA says Malusi Gigaba&#8217;s economic advisor&#8217;s presence at the international roadshow is a major red flag to international financial institutions, investors &amp; rating agencies. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba s economic advisor Professor Chris Malikane s presence at the international roadshow in the United States, is a major red flag to international financial institutions, investors and rating agencies.Malikane accompanied the minister to the US following his opinion piece on the economy, where he emphasised the nationalisation of banks, mines and insurance companies.The party says Malikane's ideas have shaken investor confidence ahead of the road show.However, the minister has distanced himself from Malikane s statement, saying he s committed to inclusive growth economic policies.DA shadow Finance Minister David Maynier Says: The fact that the minister invited Malikane to accompany him raises serious questions about his judgement and whether he can be trusted to act in the best interest of South Africa. At the end of the day the minister appears to be all spin, he says one thing and does another. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
