So tight is the cash situation that officials have suggested parents be allowed to pay their children&#8217;s school fees in goats. HARARE Zimbabweans mark 37 years of independence on Tuesday but not everyone is excited.So tight is the cash situation that officials have suggested parents be allowed to pay their children s school fees in goats.President Robert Mugabe has told schoolchildren that they needed to celebrate Zimbabwe s achievements in education.He was addressing an annual, pre-independence children s party that he and his wife Grace are always guests of honour at. The thing is that Zimbabwe s current cash squeeze is so tight, that many parents can t pay their children s school fees and institutions are struggling to find ways of meeting their costs.There s been an outcry after Education Minister Lazarus Dokora and other top officials said that parents should be allowed to pay with livestock or even offer free labour at schools. Some parents may be tempted to do this but critics say it could expose their children to ridicule from their classmates.
