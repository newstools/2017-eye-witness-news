CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) chief whip Jackson Mthembu says the party s MPs are under intense pressure to vote in favour of the looming motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.The debate will take place in 13 days time during a special sitting of Parliament.Mthembu also says MPs have been threatened from within their own party that they will be removed if they don t toe the party line.Mthembu says ANC MPs will vote against the motion of no confidence, in line with the directive from the party s National Working Committee.But he says they re being lobbied by opposition parties, including the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic freedom Fighters (EFF), and by other forces to break ranks and vote with their consciences. We ve got to delete every minute's messages that say vote in support . So that s the type of pressure we re in on WhatsApp and SMSs, it s just unimaginable. Mthembu says MPs have also been threatened by some in the party that they will be removed if they don t back President Zuma in the vote.Labelling the threats as unfortunate , Mthembu s defended his caucus as made up of tried and tested cadres who ve previously rallied to vote down motions aimed at toppling Zuma.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
