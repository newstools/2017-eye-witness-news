The DA had asked President Jacob Zuma to provide a written record of his decision and reasons for reshuffling his Cabinet. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has filed an urgent application in the High Court seeking to compel President Jacob Zuma to provide reasons for his decision to reshuffle his Cabinet on 1 April.The latest court bid follows a review application the party filed in the same court three weeks ago for Zuma's decision to fire former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas to be set aside.In its review application, the DA had asked President Zuma to provide a written record of his decision and reasons for reshuffling his Cabinet.In his response to the court, Zuma said he was exercising his executive power and that his decision was informed by political judgment to deliver on the African National Congress s mandate.But DA Federal Chairperson James Selfe says this does not suffice. Every executive action in South Africa taken by the president has to be rational in order to be legal. He had a foretaste of what would happen when changing finance ministers in December 2015. The DA is hoping the matter will be heard early next week.
