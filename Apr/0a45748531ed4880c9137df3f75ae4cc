Public Service and Administration Minister Faith Muthambi has urged government department managers to ensure service delivery is not compromised on Friday. JOHANNESBURG - Public Service and Administration Minister Faith Muthambi has called on government department managers to ensure service delivery is not compromised on Friday, as calls strengthen for South Africans to join countrywide protests against President Jacob Zuma. Demonstrations are being planned in all major CBDs, with thousands expected to march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The mass mobilisation follows Zuma s decision to fire Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas. Muthambi has reminded public servants to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner and to comply with the regulations related to their responsibilities. Muthambi has cited the Constitution and the Public Service Code of Conduct as a guide for how government employees are expected to conduct themselves. The minister, who is one of President Zuma s fiercest defenders, says citizens must receive the services they expect from government. Many of the organisations taking part in the mass action have called on the public to join the march and for companies to give staff the day off.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
