The trade federation says some people are using the phrase when they really mean the radical economic looting of state resources. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in Gauteng says while it wants to see radical economic transformation, it is aware that some people are using that phrase when they really mean the radical economic looting of state resources.Cosatu in the province also says that while it can't comment on whether President Jacob Zuma should address the federation's May Day rally in the Free State, it can say that he has not been invited to their event on Monday.Earlier this week, two Cosatu unions wrote to the federation saying Zuma should not address the rally because Cosatu had resolved that Zuma should leave office.Cosatu's Gauteng provincial secretary Dumisani Dakile says they're marching to the JSE on Monday, and believe that all forms of state capture should be opposed, including capture by monopoly capital.But he also says they're a little cynical about some of the calls for radical economic change. We are aware that while others are calling for the radical economic transformation, it means radical economic looting of the state resources. Hence we are saying we want to see the state playing an active role. Dakile says Cosatu's top leaders are currently dealing with the requests from Nehawu and the Communication Workers Union for President Zuma to not be allowed to speak at the main May Day rally in Bloemfontein.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
