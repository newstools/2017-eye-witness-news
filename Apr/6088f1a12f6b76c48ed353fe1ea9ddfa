Former ANC Chief Whip Mathole Motshekga is calling for the party's NEC to meet urgently to address calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down. JOHANNESBURG Senior African National Congress (ANC) member Dr Mathole Motshekga says the crisis unfolding in South Africa will be compounded if the party s National Executive Committee (NEC) does not take action.The former ANC chief whip is calling for the NEC to meet urgently to address calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down.Mothsekga says while the national working committee of the ANC has met, it is the NEC that is the party s highest decision-making body between conferences.He says he s written to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe asking for the national executive committee to meet. I believe that we shouldn t create an unnecessary crisis by the inaction of the NEC. The NEC has a responsibility towards the people of South Africa. It has got to meet and address the issues that they are raising. Calls for Zuma to step down are resounding across the country, including from within the ANC and its alliance partners, Cosatu and the SACP. &quot;We have a responsibility as the leadership to listen and consider what they are saying. If we disagree, we must advance reasons why. But we can t just tell them to go to hell.&quot;Motshekga believes a no confidence vote against Zuma in Parliament will fail because ANC MPs will not break ranks.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
