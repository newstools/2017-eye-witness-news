JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties say they have put their differences aside to put South Africa first by setting up a unified programme to have President Jacob Zuma removed from office. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Democratic Alliance (DA), UDM, Cope, ACDP, IFP and other parties have met in Johannesburg to formulate a plan.Delivering a statement for all involved, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said the recent Cabinet reshuffle had been reckless and opposition parties are united against Zuma.Maimane says the parties have formulated a programme of action which will include a summit, national mass action march to the Union Buildings. The courts and a motion of no confidence. Opposition parties are united in their call for Zuma to go and I believe the supremacy of the Constitution of the public must always be upheld. Agreeing with him is the EFF s national chairperson Dali Mpofu. Their own ANC stalwart, no less than Kathrada, said the President must step down. So it s not an anti-ANC thing. Maimane says this is not a call for a regime change, but for President Zuma to be removed. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
