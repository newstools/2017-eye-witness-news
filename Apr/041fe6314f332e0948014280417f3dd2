There is way forward unless they arrest that guy, that is the solution. If not, the protest will still continue. Homeowner Adriaan Groenewald says parts of his home have been reduced to ashes and now he fears for his life. I have to stay and probably get security tonight or for next week or so. Groenewald says he'll have to spend hundreds of thousands to fix his home and hopes that the protests don't continue for much longer.At the same time, shop owners in Coligny say the ongoing protest in the town has had a devastating impact on their businesses.Peter Shalala says his family has owned their shop for almost 80 years and he does not know if the business will survive Tuesday s protest. We ll have to see; I don t know if everything is covered by the insurance. Some of this stuff is old and sentimental, which you can never replace, and I don t think the insurance can help with that. Police nyalas and a helicopter are patrolling the area.
