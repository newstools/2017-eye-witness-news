JOHANNESBURG - The South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) is heading to the labour court on Friday morning to appeal the interdict that's put their strike on hold.On Wednesday, the labour court granted the interdict to SAA, ordering workers back to their cabins.At least 32 flights were cancelled as a result of the strike.Workers are demanding better working conditions and that their daily meal allowance be increased from US$130 to US$170 a day.The association's president Zazi Sibanyoni-Mugambi insists that their strike was legal, saying that all the procedures were followed to ensure their demonstration was protected.&quot;We are looking for us to be able to go back on strike because it was a legal strike.&quot;But SAA says it was an illegal strike.On Wednesday, the union missed the deadline to file answering papers explaining why SAA should not be granted the interdict.But the association says it wasn't given enough time.The airline says it will take the next two months to consult with union leaders to reach a solution.
