IAAF World Championships organisers announced that they had changed the programme to avoid the 200m and 400m events clashing. LONDON - Wayde van Niekerk s hopes of a 200/400 metres double at this year s IAAF World Championships in London were given a boost when organisers announced on Wednesday that they had changed the programme to avoid the two events clashing.South African Van Niekerk, who electrified last year s Rio Olympics by smashing the 400 metres world record with a time of 43.03 seconds in the final, had set his sights on a double gold in London.The 24-year-old s hopes, however, looked like being scuppered by the schedule, which originally put the 400 final on 8 August, just hours after the first round of the shorter sprint.The IAAF, world athletics governing body, has sought to avoid the clash by moving the first round of the 200m to 7 August to better allow for a 200m/400m doubling opportunity .It said in a statement that it had responded to requests from athletics federations, including South Africa s. I am also delighted that the Council today approved the 200m and 400m double. These double-headers create great excitement among both athletes and fans, IAAF President Sebastian Coe said.The World Championships run from 4-13 August.
