Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini filed an affidavit on Friday to explain why she shouldn't be held personally liable, blaming Sassa officials. JOHANNESBURG - The Constitutional Court will have to decide whether or not to allow South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) CEO Thokozani Magwaza to file an affidavit to counter Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini's version of what led to the grant payment saga.The minister filed an affidavit on Friday to explain why she shouldn't be held personally liable, blaming Sassa officials.Magwaza has now asked the court for permission to file his own affidavit, saying Dlamini s claims are inaccurate.Magwaza has essentially claimed that Dlamini lied to the Constitutional Court about the role she played in the social grant payment crisis.On Wednesday, Magwaza submitted a letter to the court saying he'd like the opportunity to dispute Dlamini s version of events.Dlamini has made it clear that she shouldn't be held personally liable for the payment debacle because she was not aware of the extent of the difficulties that Sassa was in, placing a large portion of the blame on Magwaza and his team.Magwaza still reports to Dlamini as the CEO of Sassa but it appears that he's adamant to show that there's more to the issue than what has been presented to the court.He says he also wants to dispel the perceptions that the public may harbour against him.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
