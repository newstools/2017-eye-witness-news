JOHANNESBURG - Syria's regime and Russia have hit back at accusations that Damascus was behind a deadly chemical weapons attack, as pressure builds for international action over what Washington calls an &quot;affront to humanity&quot;. France says it is determined to pursue a UN Security Council resolution to investigate dozens of civilian deaths in a northwestern Syria town, which turkey says it suspects were the result of exposure to nerve agent sarin.More than 70 people were killed early on Tuesday in the attack on rebel-held territory.
