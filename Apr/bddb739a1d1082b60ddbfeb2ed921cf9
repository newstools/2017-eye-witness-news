One of the residents says not much has changed since the authorities promised to intervene, adding that drugs and prostitution are destroying the community. JOHANNESBURG Two months after several houses were torched in Rosettenville in southern Johannesburg, Eyewitness News has learnt some of them have been reoccupied and are still being used as brothels and drug dens. A group called Reclaim Our Community also says many of the suspected drug dealers disappeared from the area after the attacks in February but have since resurfaced. This week, Eyewitness News was taken on a walkabout of the area by a local resident who pointed out houses from which drugs are allegedly being peddled and young girls are used as prostitutes.At least six others which were torched have been abandoned.One of the residents says not much has changed since the authorities promised to intervene, adding that drugs and prostitution are destroying the community.He says young girls are being kept inside the houses during the day and can be seen from around 6pm when they are expected to begin working on the streets. Nigerians keep the young girls inside, they lock them inside until late. Police say they have arrested nearly 300 people since February and continue to monitor the area.They have also asked residents to come forward with any fresh information on crime in this suburb.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
