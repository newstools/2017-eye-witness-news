The Tshwane Metro Police Department says the conveners have not yet met certain requirements and it is waiting for certain documents to still be submitted. JOHANNESBURG The Tshwane Metro Police Department says the South African Communist Party (SACP) and Save South Africa's applications for permission to march to the Union Buildings are still pending, while the organisations are denying it.The department says the conveners have not yet met certain requirements and it is waiting for certain documents to still be submitted.But organisers say they have submitted documents earlier this morning.Section 27's Mark Heywood who is part of the conveners says the march is legal and will go ahead. It could be a communication glitch or it could be that someone is trying to sow a little bit of confusion in order to deter people from participating in the march. We will monitor the situation throughout the day, as Save SA, and will take the steps that are necessary at the appropriate time. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
