I am a lawyer myself and understand my job. Yes, I have the power to pardon convicts and not suspects,&quot; Lungu said at a public rally broadcast on state television late on Friday.&quot;How many of my own cadres are before the courts of law today? How many have been convicted? Have you ever heard that President Lungu picked up a phone to call any police officer to drop an investigation or prosecution? so what is so special about the current one?&quot;Tensions between the government and opposition have escalated since August, when Lungu's Patriotic Front (PF) party narrowly beat the UPND in a vote the opposition says was rigged.Under Zambia's penal code, treason carries a death sentence and is non-bailable.The European Union has called for calm.
