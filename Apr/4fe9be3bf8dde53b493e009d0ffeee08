The ANC's top six held a briefing on Wednesday following its national working committee meeting on Tuesday. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Gwede Mantashe says there s no need for the party to hold a special NEC meeting to discuss the latest political developments and disagreements amongst leaders. Mantashe has also refuted reports that the party's integrity commission sent him a letter calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down.The ANC's top six held a briefing on Wednesday following its national working committee meeting on Tuesday. If you want to know why he chose that route, I think it would help if go to the president and try to have an interview with him. Mantashe was suggesting that they still don't have all the answers from the president on why he used the so-called fake intelligence report initially as a reason for axing Pravin Gordhan.But his deputy Jessi Duarte seems to believe that all issues were ironed out and therefore there is no need for a special national executive committee meeting. We haven t made any decision to have one at this point. We dealt with all the issues we thought were important. The party also indicated that the integrity commission has never released a report on President Zuma calling for him to step down, saying even the recent letter - that was widely reported on - stating that the commission asked the president to step down was withdrawn before it was submitted to Mantashe.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
