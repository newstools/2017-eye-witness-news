The Democratic Alliance wants the High Court to compel President Jacob Zuma to provide it with all the documents that informed his Cabinet reshuffle decision. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has asked the North Gauteng High Court to give President Jacob Zuma five days to provide the court with reasons for his decision to dismiss former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.The DA on Tuesday filed an urgent application to have Zuma s decision reviewed and set aside.In the wake of the country s ratings downgrade to junk status and public outcry over Zuma s decision, the DA argues that the matter must be heard as soon as possible.The DA says when Zuma decided to dismiss Gordhan, he must have foreseen that a credit rating downgrade for South Africa would be imminent.It says Zuma s seeming reliance on a so-called intelligence report for his decision to axe Gordhan was clearly irrational.The DA now wants the court to compel Zuma to provide it with all the documents, electronic records, correspondence and advice that informed his decision to reshuffle his Cabinet.The party says the move to switch finance ministers is having a calamitous effect on the country s economy and it wants the court to declare Zuma s decision unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
