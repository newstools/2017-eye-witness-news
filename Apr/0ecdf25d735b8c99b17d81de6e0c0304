A religious discourse on the teachings of lord Krishna is being held at the military museum near the Gupta's compound in Saxonwold. JOHANNESBURG - Activist group Johannesburg against Injustice says it will continue to protest against the Gupta family hosting a religious event as it believes the family is being hypocritical. A religious discourse on the teachings of lord Krishna is being held at the military museum near the Gupta's compound in Saxonwold, and will end this weekend. The organisation has been calling on the community not to attend the event because the Guptas have been embroiled in scandal and controversy. It says earlier in the week Nombonisa Gasa and Roshnee Moonnsamy were told to leave because they couldn t be trusted, while on Thursday night President Jacob Zuma attended the event, and a journalist was attacked by security and kicked out. Activist Peggy Pillay says kicking certain people out shows a level of paranoia and they continue to call on organisations to boycott the event. We believe at this point in the life of our democracy, where we can see that citizens are fed up, angry and concerned at the many violations of our Constitution; and it s in this contest that we consider it a real smack in the face of our nation. A real gross hypocrisy on the part of the Guptas that their hosting this religious discourse. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
