Wits University's Shirona Patel says the university is cognisant of the concerns listed in the memorandum and they are considering solutions. JOHANNESBURG Management at Wits University says it s ready to talk to students to address their concerns over accommodation issues at the institution.On Thursday, a group of students handed a memorandum stipulating their grievances after barricading the university's Empire Road entrance.They say the protests are as a result of management's disregard for their wellbeing.Wits University's Shirona Patel says the university is cognisant of the concerns listed in the memorandum and they are considering solutions.But the Student Representative Council (SRC) Kefentse Mkhari says these concerns are not new and the university has set them aside for far too long. Management will now look at engaging with these issues and try to resolve the ones that are outstanding. Mkhari says the protest on Thursday was the beginning of mobilising students to address other pressing issues at Wits. We have been communicating this to management. When we told them that they are not ready to shut down Esselen, they forced things and told us that these new residences will be ready. It s obvious it is not ready. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
