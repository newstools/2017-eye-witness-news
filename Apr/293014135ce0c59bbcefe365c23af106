Beneficiaries say they received calls from a &quot;Sassa official&quot; offering food parcels before they were asked for their pin codes. A new scam has surfaced in which Sassa (South Africa Social Security Agency) beneficiaries are called by someone pretending to be an official demanding personal details as well as their secret pin number. Sassa spokesman, Paseka Letsatsi says Sassa will never ask for beneficiaries details on the phone. If there is anything that's urgent, Sassa will call a beneficiary to their offices, says Letsatsi.

Letsatsi says beneficiaries should call Sassa offices to report any foul play on 0800 60 11 10.Listen to the full interview below:
