JOHANNESBURG Former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Chief Operations Officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng is expected to address the media on Wednesday about a range of issues including the 90% local content rule that he implemented last year.Motsoeneng introduced the new rule to broadcast mostly local content that has reportedly led to a decline in audience numbers and advertising.The SABC's new interim board is currently working on a plan to haul the broadcaster out of a financial crisis.Independent broadcast researcher Kate Skinner says it appears he may still have some influence. Officially he should not be playing any role, but I think that he does have a lot of influence still and there are people within the SABC, including the Chief Executive Officer James Aguma, who do rely on Motsoeneng still.
