The BFL says it&#8217;s in Saxonwold to defend the Gupta family's rights to host the weeklong Shrimad Bhagwat Katha religious event. JOHANNESBURG The Black First Land First Movement (BFL) says it s in Saxonwold today to defend the Gupta family's rights to host the weeklong Shrimad Bhagwat Katha religious event.This is amid calls by two civil organisations for their members to boycott the event, saying it s disingenuous for the family to want to host the event, while they are embroiled in corruption allegations.The event starts today at the Military Museum in Saxonwold.Dozens of people recently gathered outside the Gupta compound accusing the family of capturing the state.Yesterday, the Gujarati Network and Johannesburg Against Injustice reiterated the statements asking their members not to attend the event.But BFL s Zanele Lwana says this is all not fair. The Gupta family, like any other member of society, should be allowed to exercise their rights as to when they decide to pray, we can t be told by white settlers in this country that the Gupta family cannot engage in religious activity. She says they will confront anyone looking to disrupt the event.
