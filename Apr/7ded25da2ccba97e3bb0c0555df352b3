The trade union says the term &#8216;radical economic transformation&#8217; is being used as a smoke screen to misinform South Africans. JOHANNESBURG - Trade union Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) says the term radical economic transformation is being used as a smokescreen to misinform South Africans.A new organisation called The Freedom Movement is planning another demonstration calling on President Jacob Zuma to step down. The movement is made up of political parties, the religious fraternity, students, civil society and academics. Fedusa's Secretary General Dennis George has also encouraged South Africans to take part in the mass rally at Freedom Park on Freedom Day.George has described Zuma as the elephant in the room saying the economy will not recover with him as the head of state. The reason why I say elephant in the room is because the Constitutional Court told him, and he was ducking and diving around legal processes and the Public Protector s report against him just look at the way he dismissed Nhlanhla Nene as minister of finance.
