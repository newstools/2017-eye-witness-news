Following his Cabinet reshuffle, Lekota says President Zuma has &quot;morphed into a tin-pot dictator&quot; that has no regard for the Constitution. CAPE TOWN The Congress of the People (Cope) has joined a list of political parties calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down, saying he has shown contempt for the Constitution and the country. Party leader Mosioua Lekota held a media briefing in Parliament earlier on Saturday, after Zuma caused outrage when he made sweeping changes to his cabinet late on Thursday. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is pushing for another motion of no confidence in the president while the Economic Freedom Fighters has approached the Constitutional Court in an attempt to have the president impeached.Lekota says President Zuma has &quot;morphed into a tin-pot dictator&quot; that has no regard for the Constitution.He adds Parliament has failed to act a year after the Constitutional Court ruled the president broke his oath of office in the Nkandla matter.Cope s leader says the party wants National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to allow the DA to table its motion of no confidence against Zuma. I am quite confident that considerable number of the members of the National Assembly, especially of the ruling party, will follow the consciences and their judgement and not just vote mechanically. Lekota also had strong words for the African National Congress leadership, whom he says allowed Zuma to undermine the Constitution to the point where he has contempt for them.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
