The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union has reacted to the latest corruption revelations in an affidavit filed by Ipid in the High Court in Pretoria on Thursday. PRETORIA - The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) says it would like to see the case involving Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane resolved quickly because it's demoralising for officers on the ground. The union has reacted to the latest corruption revelations in an affidavit filed by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) in the High Court in Pretoria on Thursday. Phahlane has challenged the validity of the search warrant used by Ipid to secure a surround sound system at his private residence. The system was allegedly paid for by a police service provider. An Ipid investigator states in an affidavit that there s a high probability that Lieutenant General Phahlane is using his office and authority to undermine their investigation. Popcru s Richard Mamabolo says it would be prudent for Phahlane to step aside for the time being. I think Phahlane should consider standing down so that there is no interference until, of course, the matter has been resolved. While the Democratic Alliance has called on Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to suspend the top cop, the minister s office has declined to comment, saying this is an ongoing matter before the courts.
