Proteas Coach Russell Domingo has seemingly been given a vote of confidence by Cricket South Africa. JOHANNESBURG - Proteas Coach Russell Domingo has seemingly been given a vote of confidence by Cricket South Africa.Despite the fact that Domingo enjoyed a highly successful season with the Proteas, Cricket South Africa released a statement in January saying that they would commence the recruitment process for the appointment of a coach to take charge after the UK tour until the conclusion of the 2019 Cricket World Cup.Domingo is currently on holiday in New Zealand, having stayed in the country after guiding South Africa to a 1-0 Test series win over the Black Caps.His current deal has been extended three times, and Cricket South Africa CEO Haroon Lorgat said that the advertising of the position was a corporate governance issue. The issue around reappointing Russell is about good process. We ve got to consider labour law issues, about it being viewed as a permanent appointment versus a contract appointment, and the experts have told us to run a proper process because whoever we appoint now should be taking us until post the 2019 World Cup Lorgat said. Lorgat was adamant that the contract would be a long-term one, giving the chosen candidate ample time to prepare for cricket s showpiece event. If we were to extend for a short period, it would mean that somebody who then comes in, has not got a long time through to the World Cup. So whoever it is, whether it s Russell or another, should get a contract that goes through to the end of the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Lorgat added that the process to select the Proteas coach will only begin next month. We haven t actually opened or extended any requests for registering interest. The board meets on the 11th of May, and hopefully soon after that we commence with the process. Domingo has coached the Proteas in 159 matches across all formats of which the side has won 91 games and lost 55.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
