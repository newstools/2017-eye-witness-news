The SACP maintains it informed the ANC before communicating its decision on President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s leadership publicly. JOHANNESBURG The South African Communist Party (SACP) says there is no truth to the African National Congress (ANC) saying it announced its decision to call for the president to resign publicly before informing the party s senior officials.The communist party said on Wednesday that it no longer believes in the president s leadership.The SACP maintains it informed the ANC before communicating its decision on President Jacob Zuma s leadership publicly and says it further stated that it was available for a meeting on the matter. The SACP s Alex Mashilo says the ANC using the communist party as a scapegoat is completely unacceptable.Mashilo says the communist party has never leaked information from its bilateral engagements with the governing party and says the leak, in fact, came from senior members of the ruling party itself. We reject the allegation that it was the SACP that leaked the information, whereas in fact it was leaked from within the ranks of the ANC. Asked whether the SACP still wants to see Zuma resign, Mashilo said: We have not changed that position. The communist party also maintains that the president never consulted its members before reshuffling his Cabinet last week.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
