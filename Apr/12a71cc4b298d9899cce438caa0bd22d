Acting National Police Commissioner said he is not aware of a court order granting Save SA permission to continue with a planned anti-Zuma march. There is still confusion around the status of Friday s two main marches against president Jacob Zuma as acting Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane said the planned Tshwane marches are illegal.Earlier, Save SA group approached the court on Thursday evening, just hours after the Tshwane Metro Police Department said that no permission had been given for the so called &quot;people's march&quot; on the Union Buildings demanding that President Jacob Zuma step down.That prohibition has now been successfully overturned.
