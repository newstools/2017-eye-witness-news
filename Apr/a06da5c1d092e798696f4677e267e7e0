Mlambo Nguka says the UN population fund does critical work and has decried the US decision to cut financial aid. NEW YORK United Nation (UN) Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlalmbo-Ngcuka has added her voice to the chorus of discontent over United States President Donald Trump s decision to drastically cut funding to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). Trump s administration announced the move to cut $32.5 million, saying the agency, which helps women in 155 countries around the world, works with the Chinese government, which forces its citizens into coercive abortions and involuntary sterilisation.Mlambo-Nguka says the population fund does critical work and has decried the US decision to cut financial aid, saying UN women have witnessed the UNFPA s life-saving efforts to protect the health of women and girls and their families around the world. She, like other critics of the de-funding, says the work of the UNFPA is necessary to achieve the goals of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Other critics of the de-funding say it s based on faulty information and that it because the funding largely goes to emergency aid at a time when the world is facing the worst cluster of humanitarian crises in decades, the impact could be devastating.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
