A survey found the Christian Democrats and their Christian Social Union allies winning 36% of the vote if the election were held on Sunday BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative Christian Democrats have opened a seven-point lead over the centre-left Social Democrats five months ahead of the 24 September election, according to a poll on Sunday in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.The Emnid institute survey found the Christian Democrats and their Christian Social Union allies winning 36% of the vote if the election were held on Sunday, unchanged from a similar Emnid poll for Bild am Sonntag taken a week ago.But the Social Democrats (SPD), led by their chancellor candidate Martin Schulz, continued to slide and lost two percentage points in the week to 29%. The CDU/CSU long held a comfortable lead in polls until Schulz was nominated in early 2017 and lifted the SPD to the same levels as the CDU/CSU.The latest poll, taken just one week before an important state election in Schleswig-Holstein, also showed the CDU/CSU s preferred coalition partner, the Free Democrats (FDP), rising one point to 6% in the last week.The centre-right alliance would still be well short of winning a majority in parliament with 42%.The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) would win 9%, unchanged over the week. All parties have said they will not join forces with the AfD, making it more difficult to form the next government.The SPD s preferred partner, the Greens, rose 1 point to 7% in the last week. The far-left Linke party would win an unchanged 9%, according to the latest Emnid poll. The so-called red-red-green alliance of SPD, Linke and Greens would also fall short of a majority with 45%.The CDU/CSU and SPD currently lead Germany in a grand coalition government. Both parties have said they do not want to continue that arrangement after the 24 September election.
