The Labour Court has ruled in the SAA's favour and granted an interdict against the cabin crew association's strike. JOHANNESBURG The South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) says it will respect the order by the Labour Court and return to work.The court earlier ruled in South African Airways's (SAA) favour and granted an interdict against the association's strike.Among the association's grievances is an increase in their members' meal allowances for international trips.The association's Christopher Shabangu says, We also still have the option of talking to management, but essentially we are going back to work tomorrow. We are going to abide, for now, to the interdict until the decision is made by the executive of Sacca. SAA was forced to cancel 32 flights on Wednesday as a result of the work stoppage.Musa Zwane, the acting chief executive officer of the national carrier, says, They will agree and you will find that the matter of meal allowances then would not take priority over the other issues that were pressing to the trade union. It happened for the past four years and it was only last year that this issue, as a consultation matter, was put on the table. Workers are demanding their international meal allowance be increased from the current rate of $131 a day to $170 dollars which equates to R2,250. However, it's understood this is only one of 13 points the association has.SAA says it hopes operations will return to normal as soon as possible. It has also apologised for the inconvenience.WATCH: No fly zone: SAA cancels 32 flights after crew protest (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
