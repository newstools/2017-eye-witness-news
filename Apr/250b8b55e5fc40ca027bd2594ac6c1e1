A 23-year-old man has been arrested for plotting to murder at least 19 Cabinet members and SOEs. JOHANNESBURG A man has been arrested for allegedly plotting to assassinate individuals, including members of the Cabinet, state owned entities and other prominent South Africans.During October 2016 the Hawks intercepted communication material of the possible assassinations. The unit acted upon the information received, which lead to the arrest of a 23-year-old African male. In October last year, we intercepted information that there is an organisation that was planning to take over government, at the same time they were soliciting monies from different companies for them to assist in funding these so called operation. We then had two operations that were in Pretoria and Johannesburg. In a statement released a short while ago, the Hawks say almost 19 individuals were targeted and their names will only be divulged in court.The suspect and a founding member of the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance (ASCDSA) was arrested on Wednesday in Midrand, while he was explaining to the donors how the assassination of state capture beneficiaries was going to be carried out by the undercover coup plot snipers.The communication intercepted by the investigators included various letters which were sent to selected companies to donate money at a total amount of R140 million to fund the alleged clandestine operation.MORE ASSASSINATION PLOTS REVEALEDThe Hawks have also said that during the ongoing investigation another group, the Anti-White Monopoly Capitalists Regime (AWMCG) surfaced, leading to a two prong investigation.In Wednesday's statement, the investigative unit said it discovered that the AWMCG used the same modus operandi in soliciting donations in order to assassinate senior government officials and other South African citizens.According to the Hawks, four individuals were allegedly targeted for this operation and their names will also be revealed in court.The unit says a search was conducted at the suspect's home and evidence was confiscated for further investigation. The suspect is expected to appear before Johannesburg Magistrate Court on Friday, on the charges of conspiracy to commit murder, among others.
