The minister says he is looking forward to working with his new colleagues following President Zuma&#8217;s latest Cabinet reshuffle. JOHANNESBURG The Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen says he is excited to work with a group of what he calls young and capable Cabinet ministers&quot;.In December 2015 then Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene was fired from Treasury and replaced with Van Rooyen in a move that sent shockwaves through the markets and sent the rand plummeting.He was removed just days later and moved to cooperative governance.Van Rooyen says he is looking forward to working with his new colleagues. I can t wait to work as a collective with the new ministers. I think we should welcome the reshuffle by the president, but at the same time let us not lose focus of the real issues which, in my take, are the task at hand. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
