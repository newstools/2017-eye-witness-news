Over-using these fields could mean they would be trampled to dust, which would cost up to R400,000 per field to repair. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says it has met with South African Football Association (Safa), coming to an amicable solution on the use of soccer fields affected by the recent drought.The association says it agrees with the city that this coming soccer season cannot continue as per usual, since most of the Cape Town sport fields have not been irrigated in months.Over-using these fields could mean they would be trampled to dust, which would cost up to R400,000 per field to repair.The city's JP Smith says they ve implemented a system to ensure matches can still take place with minimal impact to infrastructure. We ve agreed on a triage system - red, amber and green - to classify these fields and the system will be updated weekly as Safa will help us do the joint monitoring, so we can try and manage these facilities. Under those different conditions, we will restrict the usage and playing levels.
