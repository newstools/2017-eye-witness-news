North Korea has said the state of affairs on the Korean peninsula was &#8216;extremely perilous&#8217; because of &#8216;madcap American nuclear war manoeuvres&#8217;. SEOUL/BEIJING - South Korea said on Friday it was on heightened alert ahead of another important anniversary in North Korea, with a large concentration of military hardware amassed on both sides of the border amid concerns about a new nuclear test by Pyongyang.North Korea said late on Friday the state of affairs on the Korean peninsula was extremely perilous because of madcap American nuclear war manoeuvres aimed at trampling on our sovereignty and right to survival. US officials said there was a higher-than-usual level of activity by Chinese bombers, signalling a possible heightened state of readiness by reclusive North Korea s sole major ally, although the officials played down concern and left open a range of possible reasons. Beijing denied its aircraft were on an increased level of alert.In Russia, the RIA news agency said a Kremlin spokesman declined to comment on media reports Russia was moving military hardware and troops towards the border with North Korea.US and South Korean officials have been saying for weeks that the North could soon stage another nuclear test in violation of United Nations sanctions, something both the United States and China have warned against.North Korea marks the 85th anniversary of the foundation of its Korean People s Army on Tuesday, an important anniversary that comes at the end of major winter military drills, South Korea s Unification Ministry spokesman Lee Duk-haeng said.Top envoys from the United States, South Korea and Japan are due to meet on Tuesday, South Korea s foreign ministry said, to discuss plans to rein in North Korea s additional high-strength provocations, to maximize pressure on the North, and to ensure China s constructive role in resolving the North Korea nuclear issue .South Korea and the United States have also been conducting annual joint military exercises, which the North routinely criticises as a prelude to invasion. It is a situation where a lot of exercise equipment is amassed in North Korea and also a lot of strategic assets are situated on the Korean peninsula because of the South Korea-US military drills, Lee told a briefing. We are closely watching the situation and will not be letting our guards down. US President Donald Trump on Thursday praised Chinese efforts to rein in the menace of North Korea , after North Korean state media warned the United States of a super-mighty preemptive strike .US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday North Korea s rhetoric was provocative but he had learned not to trust it.'UNUSUAL MOVES'The North s foreign ministry said in a statement that its military was ready to respond to American aggression. Now that we possess mighty nuclear power to protect ourselves from US nuclear threat, we will respond without the slightest hesitation to full-out war with full-out war and to nuclear war with our style of the nuclear strike, and we will emerge the victor in the final battle with the United States. In a tweet, Trump said: China is very much the economic lifeline to North Korea so, while nothing is easy if they want to solve the North Korean problem, they will. The president told a news conference some very unusual moves have been made over the last two or three hours , and that he was confident Chinese President Xi Jinping would try very hard to pressure North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes.Trump gave no indication of what the moves might be. None of the US officials who told Reuters about the heightened level of activity by Chinese bombers suggested alarm or signalled that they knew the precise reason for such activity.China s Defence Ministry said its forces on the border with North Korea were maintaining a state of normal combat preparedness and training.Asked earlier about Trump s comments, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Xi and Trump had had a full and deep discussion about North Korea when they met this month. I can only say that via deep communications between China and the US at various levels including at the highest levels, the US now has an even fuller and more correct understanding of China s policy and position and has a more rounded understanding of China s efforts, Lu said. We feel very gratified about this. An official Chinese newspaper said there was optimism about persuading the North to end its pursuit of a nuclear programme without the use of force, now that even the once tough-talking Donald Trump is onboard for a peaceful solution . Beijing has demonstrated due enthusiasm for Washington s newfound interest in a diplomatic solution and willingness to work more closely with it, the state-run China Daily said in an editorial.In Russia s Far East, some media have cited residents as saying they have seen military hardware being moved towards North Korea, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said deployment of Russian troops inside Russia was not a public matter.Tensions have risen sharply in recent months after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests. Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile.'RED LINE'North Korea has said it will test missiles when it sees fit and a South Korean analyst said he believed the country would do so. Without crossing the red line such as a nuclear test or a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, until the 25 April anniversary of the Korean People s Army, North Korea is expected to continue to launch mid-range missiles, said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at Sejong Institute outside Seoul.The joint US-South Korea military exercises are due to finish at the end of April. A US aircraft carrier strike group, led by the USS Carl Vinson, is heading towards the Korean Peninsula, Trump s administration has said.North Korea test-fired what the United States believed was a mid-range missile on Sunday. It blew up almost immediately.The failed launch came a day after the 105th anniversary of the birth of North Korea s founding father, Kim Il Sung, the current leader s grandfather.There is concern the North will use the next big day on its calendar, 25 April, to show off its strength. Although North Korea attempted a missile launch but failed on 16 April, considering the 25 April anniversary of the Korean People s Army, there are concerns that it can make another provocation again at any time, South Korea s acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn told top officials on Thursday.He called on the military to maintain readiness.
