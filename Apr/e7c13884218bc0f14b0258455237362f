The SACP has urged Treasury to ensure the Postbank is in a position to take over the distribution of social grants when the CPS contract comes to an end. PRETORIA - The South African Communist Party (SACP) has urged Treasury to ensure the Postbank is in a position to take over the distribution of social grants when the Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) contract comes to an end. This is among the demands made at a picket outside Treasury in Pretoria on Friday. The gathering of about 200 party members is one of several protests outside Treasury since President Jacob Zuma fired Pravin Gordhan and replaced him with Minister Malusi Gigaba.The SACP members chanted slogans against the Gupta family and called for an end to State Capture. The party s Jacob Mamabolo says they also want Treasury to ensure government takes over the distribution of social grants. We can also make sure that we transform the financial sector system. And, of course, one of the issues we are raising here is about creating a very viable, efficient and effective Postbank to distribute and take over the CPS contract when it expires. The CPS contract comes to an end in April next year.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
