The Police Minister says he withdrew the appeal in the Berning Ntlemeza matter which was filed by his predecessor Nathi Nhleko because it was in the national interest. PRETORIA - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says the case challenging the appointment of Berning Ntlemeza as head of the Hawks should never have been pursued because it had no prospects for success.Mabula took a swipe at his predecessor Nathi Nhleko at a briefing in Pretoria, where he announced Hawks Deputy Commissioner Yolisa Matakata would act in the top post until further notice.Nhleko permanently appointed Ntlemeza as head of the unit last year despite a High Court ruling which found he had lied under oath and lacked integrity.The High Court ruled on Wednesday that Ntlemeza should immediately vacate the post.Mbalula says he withdrew the appeal in the Ntlemeza matter which was filed Nhleko because it was in the national interest. Why should I run around in courts when I know the case cannot be won? In fact, we have lost it from day one. So we should have just observed the law, go back and then do what is right. It s understood Ntlemeza intends petitioning the Supreme Court of Appeal directly, but it is unlikely to help him to regain the top post.Mbalula says he hopes to appoint a permanent head of the Hawks by the end of the year and says the process will be followed to the letter of the law. First we will follow all processes in terms of briefing Cabinet with regard to this matter, and as soon as possible our desire is to ensure that we appoint a permanent head of the Hawks; probably before the end of the year. The South African Police Service Act states that the minister must have concurrence with Cabinet to appoint the head of the unit.The legislation requires the person to be fit and proper, with due regard to the person s experience, conscientiousness and integrity.(Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
