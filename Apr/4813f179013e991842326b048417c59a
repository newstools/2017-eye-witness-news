CAPE TOWN - The chairperson of Parliament's police oversight committee says a new permanent head for the Hawks must be above politics.Francois Beukman has also welcomed new Police Minister Fikile Mbalula's promise that the appointment will be made soon.The Hawks confirmed earlier that former Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza would not be reporting for work on Tuesday, despite weekend reports that he still considers himself as the head of the unit.Mbalula last week named Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata as acting head.The move followed the High Court setting aside Ntlemeza s appointment because of an earlier ruling that he's not a fit and proper person to hold office.Beukman says it is up to Mbalula to initiate the process of appointing a new permanent head of the Hawks.He says that person would need the appropriate skills and would also have to be a fit and proper person . The head of the Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation (DPCI) must at all stages act a-politically, in line with the Constitution and in line with the police act. Beukman says the committee will be meeting with Mbalula, top police officials, Ipid and other police entities once Parliament resumes business in the first week of May.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
