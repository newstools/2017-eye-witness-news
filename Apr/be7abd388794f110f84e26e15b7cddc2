Firefighters used hydrants from buildings across the road to fight the fire at Braampark offices in Johannesburg. JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Emergency Management Services (EMS) says its investigation into the fire at the Braampark offices in Johannesburg will also include why the fire hydrants were not working. Firefighters used hydrants from buildings across the road to fight the fire.The flames were extinguished with no serious injuries reported. EMS s Synock Matobako says the dysfunctional hydrants made fighting the flames difficult for firefighters. It looks like it was [started on] the fifth floor because when you look at the building, the fire was on the roof. The whole roof has collapsed. He says they can t say what started the fire, but it did originate on the top floor.#BraamPark Synock Matobako from the Johannesburg EMS gives an update on the situation.

We are still going to check the stability of the building, whether it is stable for anyone to go inside and then start doing the investigation. It can take quite a long time for us to know what caused the fire. Investigators were still on the scene.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
