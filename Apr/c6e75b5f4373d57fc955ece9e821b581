A defiant Berning Ntlemeza reported for duty at the unit&#8217;s Silverton headquarters on Monday morning despite being told he no longer hold the position. PRETORIA The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to act decisively against Berning Ntlemeza to ensure he doesn t resume his position as head of the Hawks. A defiant Ntlemeza reported for duty at the unit s Silverton headquarters on Monday morning despite being told he no longer holds the position.The High Court ruled that the lieutenant general may not be head of the unit but he has approached the Supreme Court to appeal the finding. A small group of DA supporters is picketing outside the Hawks offices where Ntlemeza slipped in through a back entrance. The party s Zakhele Mbele says Ntlemeza s return to work in light of the damning court judgments is simply unacceptable. It really amounts to a violation of the rule of law. It s an escalation of the crisis we already have in the governance and leadership of the Hawks if Ntlemeza is able to stay on and interfere in the effectiveness of the Hawks. Mbele doesn t believe Mbalula has done enough to stop Ntlemeza s interference in the Hawks.Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata has been acting in the position for nearly two weeks now.It s unclear how the Police Ministry is going to handle the situation but it doesn't appear that Ntlemeza was barred from entering the offices.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
