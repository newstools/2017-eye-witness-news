JOHANNESBURG - National Treasury has been cautioned to make sure it doesn t lose any more experienced staff.Director-General Lungisa Fuzile confirmed on Wednesday he s resigning and will leave Treasury in the middle of May. His departure follows the firing of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.The outgoing director-general had indicated that he intended to stay on to give a sufficient handover to his successor. However, Treasury released a statement on Wednesday confirming his imminent departure. Pan African and Research Services Iraj Abedian said: When you have the DG disappearing, the minister and deputy minister disappearing and the DDG also disappearing - it's bad news. Almost a case of cutting your nose to spite your face. He says Treasury relies on the credibility of top management. Possibly further resignations or exits mean the loss of institutional memory. Abedian says experienced staff members must be retained to run the Treasury.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
