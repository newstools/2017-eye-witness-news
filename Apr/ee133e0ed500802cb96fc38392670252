It s believed the discolouration was caused by mud and ash that washed into the dam following flash floods earlier this week.Tests done last week apparently revealed the levels of iron content in the water was within the country s standards.Oudtshoorn mayor Colin Sylvester says, Although we re confident that our water poses no risks for our consumers, we re compelled by law to issue a warning to consumers about potential health risks involved when drinking our water. Thus we recommend that tap water should first be boiled before being consumed. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
