The party will be asking the High Court to review President Zuma's decision to reshuffle Cabinet and the consequences of that decision. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) says its finalising court papers with the hope of lodging its review application of last week's Cabinet reshuffle in the North Gauteng High Court as soon as Tuesday afternoon. The party will be asking the court to review President Jacob Zuma's decision to reshuffle Cabinet and the consequences of that decision. On Friday, the DA lost its urgent bid in the Western Cape High Court to stop the swearing in of new ministers that same evening. The DA's Federal Council Chairperson James Selfe says the review application will specifically focus on the dismissal of former finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his replacement with Minister Malusi Gigaba. We obviously have to cite Mr Gordhan and Mr Jonas because they are affected. The others are simply respondents that are there in case they have anything to say. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
