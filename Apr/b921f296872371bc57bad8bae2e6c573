The metro has been searching for solutions as its water supply has been under pressure in the wake of the recent drought. CAPE TOWN A beer brewery has presented a desalination solution to assist in addressing the water scarcity in Nelson Mandela Bay.The metro has been searching for solutions as its water supply has been under pressure in the wake of the recent drought.A possible three-way deal between a brewery, a salt manufacturer and the municipality could pose a partial solution.Marina Sea Salt pumps 30 megalitres of partially desalinated water back into the ocean every day during its operations.South African Breweries (SAB), located just down the road, utilises their own plant to purify two megalitres of water for their products.Nelson Mandela Bay's Annette Lovemore explains this is where SAB saw an opportunity. They will look at funding the first 10 megalitres, so they will take 10 megalitres off the 30 megalitres that Marina Sea Salt has got and purify it further. They will take their two megalitres they need each day, and the other eight megalitres will then be available to Nelson Mandela Bay. She says this model, which is still just a draft, will cost the municipality much less than the R1.5 billion it will take to build its own desalination plant.
