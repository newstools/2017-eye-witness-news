The discussion comes after another ANC alliance partner the SACP called on President Jacob Zuma to resign over the weekend. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has confirmed its special central executive committee meeting is discussing whether to call on President Jacob Zuma to step down.The meeting is currently underway at Cosatu House in Braamfontein.The discussion comes after another African National Congress (ANC) alliance partner the South African Communist Party (SACP) called on the president to resign over the weekend.Late last year Cosatu s biggest affiliate National Health Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) said it had lost confidence in President Zuma and it called on him to step down. Following its numerous executive committee meetings, Cosatu did not take a position on the matter, going as far as denying ever discussing it.But the federation now can t escape the issue because it has been placed firmly on the agenda by some national office bearers at the meeting.Like the SACP, the federation will now decide if the President must step down.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
