The ANC in the Western Cape says it wants the party's national executive committee to call a special meeting to discuss the Cabinet reshuffle. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) and its youth league in the Western Cape are at loggerheads over their stance on President Jacob Zuma's Cabinet reshuffle.The youth league is disputing the outcome of this weekend's provincial executive committee (PEC) meeting, saying what is contained in a media statement from the PEC is not what was agreed on after a marathon session of the provincial executive.But the PEC has hit back, saying it won't be dictated to by its youth wing.The ANC in the Western Cape says it wants the party's national executive committee to call a special meeting to discuss the Cabinet reshuffle, adding that the integrity commission should also probe the matter.But the youth league's provincial secretary Andile Mbali says this is not the position agreed on at this weekend's PEC meeting. That was the view of an individual at that meeting. That is not the true reflection of what happened in our view as the ANCYL. But ANC PEC member Lionel Adendorf says the youth league is boxing above its weight. That is the official view as it was discussed and summarised at the PEC meeting. Any other view is wrong, disingenuous and seeks to undermine the authority of the PEC. The PEC says it will begin a campaign soon to boost its membership in the province, which has been dwindling over the last five years. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
