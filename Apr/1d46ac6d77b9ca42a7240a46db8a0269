Chris Malikane wrote a piece which he says aims to propose to the ANC that it changes its policies regarding the nationalisation of some industries. JOHANNESBURG Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba s newly appointed advisor Chris Malikane says he will stand by his views on the expropriation of white monopoly establishments such as banks, mines and insurance companies. The paper penned by Malikane seems contrary to Minister Gigaba s speech to investors that the country s economy will remain on the course of fiscal discipline and reduce state debt that was set by his predecessor Pravin Gordhan.Malikane says his opinion piece aims to propose to the African National Congress (ANC) that it changes its policies regarding nationalisation of some industries to industrialise the economy.The Treasury has however distanced itself from the advisor s piece, saying that it was written in a personal capacity.But Malikane says it is within the minister's prerogative on whether or not to consider his advice. The whole aim was for me to influence public discourse and to also to influence the discourse taking place within in the ANC because the party is going into its policy conference and they have invited us to make proposals.
