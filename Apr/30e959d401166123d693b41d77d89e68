SAB officials say many users have complained of abuse by others taking far more water than is allowed. CAPE TOWN - South African Breweries (SAB) is implementing additional measures to ensure its Newslands Springwater collection point is accessible to as many people as possible. SAB officials say many users have complained of abuse by others taking far more water than is allowed. The maximum limit per person is 25 litres per day. The facility has installed CCTV cameras, an &quot;express tap&quot; for faster collection as well as a high mast light for security at night.Newlands Brewery General Manager John Stenslunde says the escalating water crisis has resulted in more people flocking to the natural water source. Any use from a commercial point of view from a spring like that requires an extraction permit which we have in terms of our operation, but in discussion with the city, anyone who s using it for commercial use needs to have a license for that.
