But more than that he s got a huge problem in trying to allay scepticism surrounding his stigma associated with State Capture and corruption. That I think is even a more difficult challenge to overcome as concerns about whether or not he can do the job. WATCH: Gigaba: I knew credit rating downgrade was coming(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
