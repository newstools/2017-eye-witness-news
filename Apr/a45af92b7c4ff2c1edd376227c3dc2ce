CAPE TOWN - Lobby group Equal Education is demanding that the Eastern Cape Education Department immediately fixes hundreds of dilapidated and neglected schools in the province.The organisation published a report earlier this week in which it investigated the government's compliance with its mandate to fix all public schools, especially in the Eastern Cape.The organisation on Thursday led hundreds of pupils on a march in King William's Town to handover the report and memorandum addressed to Education MEC Mandla Makupula.Equal Education's report - titled Planning to Fail - paints a picture of systematic failure by both the provincial and national education ministries to fix dilapidated schools in the Eastern Cape.The norms and standards report states that all schools must have running water and proper sanitation.It also says that schools built with mud, wood and zinc should have been replaced with proper materials by the end of last year.Equal Education visited 60 schools in different parts of the province and found they don't meet the Basic Education department's criteria.The organisation's Luzuko Sidimba: &quot;The department is in violation of their own obligations. They've not complied with the norms and standards. Some schools are built with inappropriate structures.&quot;Equal Education wants the Eastern Cape government to respond with a proper delivery plan within a week.
