Patrick Wisani was found guilty of beating Nosipho Mandleleni to death at the couple&#8217;s Yeoville flat in 2015. JOHANNESBURG - A judge has likened the fatal wounds sustained by the girlfriend of former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) leader Patrick Wisani to those inflicted by a master on a slave.He was found guilty of beating Nosipho Mandleleni to death at the couple s Yeoville flat in 2015.Sentencing proceedings in the trial have been postponed to next month.Judge Ismail Muhamed says it is clear that Wisani knew what he was doing when killing Mandleleni because he even changed her clothes after beating her, seemingly to get rid of evidence.However, Advocate Cronje Kriel said the murder was not premeditated and should not be treated as such.He has also argued that Wisani has played a vital role in the community by heading his local community policing forum.Kriel told the court that at 32, Wisani was relatively young and could still be rehabilitated.He suggested that Wisani be sentenced to three years in prison and not life imprisonment as suggested by Mandleleni's mother. Wisani was questioned by both the State and the defence on Monday.He said although he had been found guilty of murder, he did not commit the crime.However, the State submitted that on the basis that the murder of Mandleleni was premeditated and that Wisani had shown no remorse, he should be sentenced to life in prison or at the very least the minimum of 15 years.But the defence argued that while Wisani may have beaten Mandleleni, there was no intention to kill her.Judge Muhamed has postponed the sentencing to 11 May, saying the case needs thorough analysis and lengthy consideration.
