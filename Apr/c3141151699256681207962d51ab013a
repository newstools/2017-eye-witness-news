Hlompho Kekana says Mamelodi Sundowns are struggling in the goal scoring department. JOHANNESBURG Mamelodi Sundowns are in action against city rivals SuperSport United in the Tshwane Derby on Thursday night.The reigning league champions are without a win in five games in all competitions, while Matsatsantsa are looking to open a five-point gap between them and Sundowns.Hlompho Kekana says Sundowns are struggling in the goal scoring department. The only thing that s letting us down is that we don t do well in front of goals, we don t have confidence or we re not ruthless enough because, to be honest, we ve been creating chances in every game we play but we fail to convert them. Kekana says they've missed Keagan Dolly a lot. I would say yes, we do miss Keagan, because he was our key player for the past season and the games that we played in the Champions League. Dean Furman says SuperSport needs to redeem themselves for their loss in the last match. I wouldn t say the league is over after these two games, regardless of what happens. Every team is still playing everyone, so there s a lot of twists and turns to come. Furman says there are some surprises to come in the last league matches. For us to lose against Baroka FC was a huge disappointment and it s something that we want to put behind us and come back strongly. We ve to go and fight hard to get the three points against Sundowns. Losses at this stage of the season can dent your campaign. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
