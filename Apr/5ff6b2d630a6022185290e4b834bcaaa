In a statement issued on Tuesday, they say Zuma has lost all moral legitimacy to govern and therefore should do the honourable thing and step down. JOHANNESBURG - The National Religious Leaders Council (NRLC) and church leaders have called on President Jacob Zuma to step down.In a statement issued on Tuesday, they say that &quot;it is evident that we have gone beyond a leadership crisis in our country&quot;.It adds that Zuma &quot;has lost all moral legitimacy to govern and therefore should do the honourable thing and step down&quot;.Read the full statement below:Following momentous events unleashed last week by President Jacob Zuma the NRLC and Church Leaders have decided to release the following statement.It is evident that we have gone beyond a leadership crisis in our country. The fact that both the President, his Deputy and some of the top six in the ruling party are no longer singing the same song, laying bare the crisis facing our country. The actions of the President of recalling the former Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan, and his Deputy from an International Roadshow which was aimed at wooing investors and engaging with Rating Agencies, has left South Africa embarrassed and humiliated on the International stage. It is beyond comprehension that the President, who is required by the Constitution to put South Africa and its people first, could behave in a manner contrary to his Oath of Office.While the country was still in shock last week that such an action of recalling the Finance Minister was effected, the President still re-shuffled his cabinet and fired Minister Pravin Gordhan and his Deputy, viewed by Religious Leaders and the majority of South Africans as competent people of integrity and who have always prioritised the interests of South Africa and its people. The question is what motivated the President to behave in this manner? As a result of these actions, South Africans woke up this morning to the news that our country has now been downgraded to junk status which will have devastating implications on our economy, affecting job creation, investment and the poorest of the poor.For the past eighteen months the President has continuously taken South Africa into a downward spiral and the cumulative effect of these and current events is that President Jacob Zuma has lost all moral legitimacy to govern and therefore should do the honourable thing and step down.The ANC and Parliament have now no reason to delay holding the President accountable and do everything in their power to remove him from office.Religious Leaders and Church Leaders are encouraging people to join the march on Friday 7th April in Pretoria city centre together with Civil Society and SAVE SA in protest against corruption and bad leadership. South Africans can no longer stand on the sidelines and watch President Jacob Zuma ruin our beloved country which we struggled so hard for.Issued by:National Religious Leaders Council (NRLC)Rev Ray McCauleyPundit Ashwin TrikamjeeChief Rabbi Warren GoldsteinMoulana Ebrahim BhamChurch leadersArchbishop Thabo Makgoba (Anglican Church)Bishop Zipho Siwa (South African Council
