Without any doubt, the people who are marching against President Jacob Zuma, it s a clear agenda of the regime change. We have been talking about it, it s now in the open. For a start they are marching to the Union Buildings but we know that in future they are going to stage a 30-day sit in. It s the beginning of a regime change we are not going to allow it, and it will never happen. Earlier three anti-Zuma protesters held a placard that said: &quot;You must be joking&quot;.ANC supporters reacted to that and started punching and kicking them before the police whisked them away.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
