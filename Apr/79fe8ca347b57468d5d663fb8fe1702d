This follows the 3 April announcement by S&amp;P that it had lowered its foreign currency ratings on South Africa. JOHANNESBURG - S&amp;P Global Ratings has announced it is lowering its ratings on FirstRand Bank, FirstRand, Nedbank, Investec Bank, Absa Bank, Barclays Africa Group, and BNP Paribas Personal Finance South Africa.This follows the 3 April announcement by S&amp;P that it had lowered its foreign currency ratings on South Africa to 'BB+/B' from 'BBB-/A-3', with a negative outlook. It also lowered its national scale rating on South Africa to 'zaAA-' from 'zaAAA'.S&amp;P Global says it does not rate financial institutions above a country's sovereign rating, due to the direct and indirect impact of the overall rating on a banks' operation.Nedbank says South Africa's ratings have been placed on review by Moody s and lowered to junk status by S&amp;P Global but despite the downgrade, Nedbank is operating in a banking system that is sound and well capitalised.Barclays also explains that it's the norm for their credit rating to be very closely linked to that of the country, but says recent developments have been disappointing because, until last week, the country was building momentum towards better economic growth by the end of the year.Since President Jacob Zuma's Cabinet reshuffle, when Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were removed, the country's banks have lost around R61 billion.In a statement issued on Thursday, S&amp;P said: &quot;We do not rate financial institutions in South Africa above the foreign currency sovereign ratings, due to the direct and indirect impact that a sovereign distress would have on banks' operations.&quot;As a result, we are lowering our ratings on FirstRand Bank Ltd, FirstRand Ltd, Nedbank Ltd, Investec Bank Ltd, Absa Bank Ltd, Barclays Africa Group Ltd, and BNP Paribas Personal Finance South Africa Ltd (BNPPPF), and our rating on the domestic medium-term note program issued by BNP Paribas (acting through its local branch).&quot;The negative outlooks on the first four entities reflect that on the sovereign and indicate that we could lower the ratings further if we lower our foreign currency ratings on South Africa. The other three entities and the note program carry national scale ratings only, to which we do not assign outlooks.&quot;
