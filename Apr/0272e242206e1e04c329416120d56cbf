The department says funding required to meet the current backlog against its annual budget makes it almost impossible to achieve its goals. CAPE TOWN The Basic Education Department says it will need just over R52 billion to ensure all Eastern Cape schools have proper infrastructure.Lobby group Equal Education is launching another campaign in an attempt to force the national and provincial departments to meet their own deadlines, which the organisation claims they have failed to do. The national department s own report shows more than 2,000 schools in the province are either made of &quot;inappropriate materials&quot; or are in need of sanitation, access to water or electricity.In its Minimum Norms and Standards report, the Basic Education Department sets itself time frames to ensure all Eastern Cape schools have proper facilities by 2030.The department, however, says funding required to meet the current backlog against its annual budget makes it almost impossible to achieve its goals.Equal Education s Ntuthuzo Ndzomo says the departments have yet to meet a November deadline requiring improved infrastructure. It feels as if we re derailing in providing quality education to learners and this is something which has been reoccurring for the past few years. The organisation also says it has evidence of suppliers leaving school construction halfway because they were not paid or because of shoddy work.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
