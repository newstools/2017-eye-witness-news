After initially holding out Numsa now joins majority unions who signed a 9% wage hike deal, ending a strike which saw thousands of commuters stranded this week. JOHANNESBURG The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has ended the nationwide bus strike on Saturday after South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) and two other unions reached an agreement with employers on Friday.The union says the decision comes after extensive consultation from regions in all nine provinces on Saturday, and they agreed upon the 9% wage hike for the sake of peace and stability in the sector.Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim says although it will take time for all members to return to work, they expect all of them to be back by next Tuesday.Jim says the union will continue to pressurise the labour department to do proper oversight in the bus passenger sector.Acting spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi says, Numsa has decided to end the strike in the bus passenger sector. Despite being the second biggest union sector, we had to accept this sell-out deal for the sake of industrial peace and stability; we therefore urge all our members to return to work. Speaking at a media briefing on Friday, Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant said the bargaining council deal is collectively binding. If the majority of the trade unions who are participating in that collective bargaining and the majority of the employers, if they have agreed then that will be the decision of the council. The unions and the bus companies have settled on a 9% increase over a one-year period, and a 1.5% hike for overtime.Additional reporting by Tendani Mulaudzi(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
