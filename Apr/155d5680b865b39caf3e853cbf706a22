AB de Villiers clobbered nine sixes and three fours in a 46-ball blitz against the Kings XI Punjab at Indore's Holkar Cricket Stadium. NEW DELHI - Fit-again South African AB de Villiers was pleasantly surprised to discover he has lost none of his touch after the batsman blasted a swashbuckling 89 not out in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match on Monday.The 33-year-old, who has taken a break from tests to manage his workload, missed the final of South Africa's domestic 50-overs tournament with a back injury, which also kept him out of Royal Challengers Bangalore's IPL opener against Delhi.There was no sign of any rust, however, as the player celebrated for his '360-degree' batting prowess clobbered nine sixes and three fours in a 46-ball blitz against the Kings XI Punjab at Indore's Holkar Cricket Stadium.His brilliant innings helped a slow-starting Bangalore set a competitive 148 for four total but the hosts proved too strong in their reply, easing to an eight-wicket victory with 33 balls to spare.&quot;I did surprise myself and played a few good shots,&quot; De Villiers, who was wearing a microphone, told the commentary team while he was fielding, admitting he had periods of uncertainty during the layoff.&quot;It's not like you become a bad player overnight, the rustiness is more self-doubt,&quot; he added.A couple of his sixes sailed out of the stadium and such was his timing that even when he charged a Mohit Sharma delivery which turned out wider than he had assumed, De Villiers made a late adjustment to send it over the long-off boundary.&quot;Mr 360 is back! Genius @ABdeVilliers17,&quot; tweeted India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh, no mean six-hitter himself.Sunrisers Hyderabad captain David Warner also doffed his hat at the South African, calling him &quot;best in the business&quot; while many of de Villiers' compatriots hailed the knock.&quot;If I was a commentator I'd do a mic drop and enjoy the show... No words can describe @ABdeVilliers17... wow!&quot; Proteas paceman Morne Morkel tweeted.VIDEO: How a timely phone call to Mrs. de Villiers helped AB de Villiers overcome self-doubt before the comeback ...
