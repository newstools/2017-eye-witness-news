JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has sent his condolences to the family of former Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) leader Philip Kgosana, who died at the age of 80. Kgosana passed away at a Pretoria hospital on Thursday after a short illness. He was well known for leading more than 30,000 anti-pass protesters from Langa to Parliament in 1960.Political parties, including the Economic Freedom Fighters and Congress of the People, have also sent their condolences, calling him a selfless man.The PAC s Kenny Mokgatle says the party is saddened to have lost such a revolutionary leader. He was not only a veteran because he joined politics during the liberation movement, he was a veteran because he was about politics when it was not safe to do so. He led when it was dangerous to do so as he risked not only his own life but the lives of those who surrounded him. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
