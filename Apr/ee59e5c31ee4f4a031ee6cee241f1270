Malikane proposes a new economic plan, including 'expropriation of white monopoly capital establishments to industrialise the economy'. CAPE TOWN - The Ministry of Finance has distanced itself from an economic blueprint penned by Malusi Gigaba s new economics adviser.In a statement issued a short while ago, the ministry says Professor Chris Malikane wrote in his personal capacity.In an opinion piece published by the Sunday Times, Malikane proposes a new economic plan that includes the expropriation of white monopoly capital establishments such as banks, insurance companies, mines and other monopoly industries to industrialise the economy .Gigaba s been telling investors that the country s economy will remain on the course of fiscal discipline and reduce state debt that was set by his predecessor Pravin Gordhan.But the views of Gigaba s new economic adviser and Wits professor are in stark contrast.Now the ministry is saying Malikane s opinion piece was written in his capacity as an academic and activist and do not necessarily reflect government policy.Gigaba s spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete says in the statement that Professor Malikane has a right to contribute ideas to the national discourse on any subject.But he says Gigaba wants it on the record that the ministry s work will continue to be guided by the African National Congress s policies, as set out in its conference resolutions and 2014 elections manifesto.
