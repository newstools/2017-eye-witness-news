UDM's request follows directives issued by the Constitutional Court, giving parties in the matter until next week to file their paperwork. CAPE TOWN - The United Democratic Movement (UDM) has written to Speaker Baleka Mbete requesting a postponement of next week s vote on a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.This follows directives issued by the Constitutional Court earlier on Tuesday, giving parties involved in the matter until next week to file all the necessary paperwork.The debate has been set down for next week Tuesday after Speaker Mbete agreed to reconvene Parliament at the request of opposition parties.Opposing parties, including the speaker, have been given until Thursday to file papers, while the UDM has until next week Wednesday to respond.All further written submissions must be filed by Friday 21 April. UDM lawyer Eric Mabuza said: The implication of all this is that the sitting on the 18th will have to be postponed, and to that end, we've written to the speaker to get a guarantee that she will postpone the sitting. But Parliamentary spokesman Moloto Mothapo, however, says the motion can only be postponed by its sponsor.
