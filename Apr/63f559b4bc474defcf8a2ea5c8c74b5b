Residents who rent or own a property valued at over R1m will be billed the same home user tariff of just under R250 a month. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says electricity billing will change in July to promote equity.Residents who rent or own a property valued at more than a million rand will be billed the same home user tariff of just under R250 a month.Mayoral committee member for utilities Xanthea Limberg says the city has to start charging everyone equally for the use and maintenance of the city's electricity infrastructure.The new electricity billing method will impact low usage consumers the most as the subsidised, free service connection fee will be phased out.Previously the home user tariff was charged as part of the unit price of electricity, and was thus determined by how much electricity was consumed each month.Limberg says this is no longer sustainable. We need to make sure that all consumers carry this particular charge to ensure that we can continuously maintain the infrastructure to an adequate standard. The city will also be doing away with its free water allocation as it looks to clamp down on water usage.
