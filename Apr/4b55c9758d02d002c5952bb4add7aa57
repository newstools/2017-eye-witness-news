Sacca says its strike at South African Airways (SAA) was a success despite a court ordering its members to return to work immediately. JOHANNESBURG The South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) says its strike at South African Airways (SAA) was a success despite a court ordering its members to return to work immediately.On Wednesday, workers affiliated to the union demonstrated outside Airways Park in Kempton Park, demanding an increase in their international meal allowances.This forced the national carrier to cancel 32 domestic and international flights.The union s President Zazi Nsibanyoni says: It s never a nice thing to inconvenience our passengers. You know when you re left with no choice in order for the employer to listen, these are the legal processes that we can embark on. Look, it was successful and we were hoping that we would have resolved it and not have gone on strike in the first place. The protesters at the Airways Park dispersed just moments after their leaders delivered a message from SAA that they should vacate the area.Sacca's Mpho Moikangoa said they will continue engaging the airline in an effort to resolve their issues with management. We have exhausted everything with all our issues, which is about 13 of them. The meal allowance is an issue that was affecting us every day.&quot;Moikangoa said besides the meal allowance dissatisfaction, SAA has not been able to have clear career path development for workers, and haven t been complying with some acts governing the relationship between employee and their employer.Meanwhile, it is not clear if domestic flights which were earlier cancelled will be diverted to Thursday when workers return.
