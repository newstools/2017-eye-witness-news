Pravin Gordhan says the relationship between the state arms manufacturer and Gupta-linked arms firm VR Laser is a symbol of State Capture. JOHANNESBURG - Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan says the relationship between state arms manufacturer Denel and Gupta-linked arms firm VR Laser is a symbol of State Capture.The Treasury halted a deal between the two entities, allegedly because they had already entered into a partnership without permission and disregarded due process.Denel has since filed papers against Treasury asking the court to intervene and allow the deal to go ahead.Gordhan told mourners at the memorial of the late struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada that state owned enterprises are meant to be accountable to South Africans.Gorhan says Denel is trying to bully its way into a dodgy deal with VR Laser. Why is it that a structure like Denel now goes to court and says get out of our way we still want to continue with the Denel-Asia venture with a company called VR Laser ? Gordhan says this move by Denel is a clear example of State Capture. That s a relationship between State Capture and getting away with it. If you don t understand what State Capture means, that s what it means. Newly-appointed Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba told the media on Saturday that he s not planning to withdraw the case against Denel.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
