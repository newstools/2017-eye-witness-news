Sepp Blatter has said he had met lawyers from the US Justice Department but was not a suspect in their corruption investigations. ZURICH - Disgraced former Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on Friday he had met lawyers from the US Justice Department but was not a suspect in their corruption investigations.The 81-year-old, banned for six years by Fifa s own ethics committee at the height of a scandal engulfing world soccer s governing body, told journalists he had otherwise had little contact with US lawyers and was not under the scrutiny of their legal system.Several dozen soccer officials, including a number from Fifa, were indicted in the United States in 2015 on corruption-related chances.Blatter was not among them, although he subsequently said his lawyer had advised him not to travel abroad. I have had very little contact from my American lawyers because I was never a person of interest under scrutiny by the American justice, he told a roundtable of international reporters on Friday. I have been investigated in two or three matters ... but there is no wrongdoing. He said Swiss prosecutors had not contacted him over a separate case initiated in September 2015 against him relating to accusations of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation. I have never heard anything, my lawyer has heard nothing about that. I have been interviewed and I will be interviewed in future but not in these cases; I am interviewed in cases concerning the activities in Fifa, as a person of information, he said.Blatter said he was still generally liked by his Swiss compatriots. Here in the city of Zurich and Switzerland in general, I am not only accepted but they like me, said Blatter, who has denied all charged against him. I don t have the impression that I am a rejected man. Why should I be rejected? I have done a good (job at) Fifa.
