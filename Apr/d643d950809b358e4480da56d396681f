Comfort Ngidi says his client Berning Ntlemeza has done nothing wrong and has called on Fikile Mbalula not to interfere. JOHANNESBURG - Berning Ntlemeza's lawyer says his client has returned the car and phone he took from the Hawks. However, Comfort Ngidi says his client has done nothing wrong and has called on Police Minister Fikile Mbalula not to interfere in the matter.The minister has reiterated that Ntlemeza is no longer head of the unit following a court order which ruled he is neither fit nor proper to hold the position.Ngidi says an appeal has been lodged and therefore Ntlemeza is still in his position. As soon as you file for an appeal which we have done in Bloemfontein on Friday, I hear the minister saying we didn t but we did, I d challenge anybody to go and see that we ve filed our appeal. He says the law must be respected. Automatically suspended the decision of the high court pending the appeal. What we ve said is that the minister in our view is pretty immature until the appeal is heard.&quot;WATCH: Cowboys &amp; Crooks? &quot;Ntlemeza showed us the finger&quot;Mbalula says Ntlemeza is wrongfully sending a message to the public that there is lawlessness within the Hawks and it won t be tolerated. The minister appointed an acting head of the Hawks a week ago, after the high court ruled the former Hawks head may no longer hold the top post. The minister considers the former top cop s attempt to report for duty on Monday morning as unlawful. Mbalula says he will not be distracted by this issue. There is no lawlessness, we are not going to allow a state lawlessness. General Ntlemeza is basically trying to communicate the wrong message that there is confusion, lawlessness and that anybody can do as they please that cannot happen. We are focused and we are at work, that s what is important. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
