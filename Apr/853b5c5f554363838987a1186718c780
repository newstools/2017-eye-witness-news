JOHANNESBURG - The Gujarati Network in South Africa is calling on its members to boycott an event allegedly hosted by the Gupta family in Saxonwold this weekend. It s understood the annual religious event is set down for eight days at the military museum close to the family s compound. It s expected to kick off on Sunday (16 April).Some community members say they don't want to associate themselves with the controversial family amid increasing calls for the Guptas to leave the country.Last week dozens of people gathered outside the Gupta compound in Saxonwold, accusing the family of capturing the state. Now the Gujarati community is calling on its members to boycott a religious event starting this Sunday, which is allegedly being hosted by the Guptas.It's understood that the family is sponsoring buses, meals and entertainment for hundreds of people over the eight day period.But community members and a group of concerned citizens say hypocritical for the Guptas to host this spiritual event especially during a national crisis. The Gupta's lawyer Gert van der Merwe says objections from the community are unfortunate.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
