Mmusi Maimane says that whatever happens in 2019, the DA will only go into a coalition with the ANC if there is a breakaway faction that will agree with the party&#8217;s programme. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance s (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says that whatever happens in 2019, the DA will only go into a coalition with the African National Congress (ANC) if there is a breakaway faction that will agree with the party s programme and says they will only work with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) if the party is willing to compromise on its radical policies.Maimane spoke to Eyewitness News in an exclusive wide-ranging interview.The party is already leading coalition governments in three key metros lost by the ANC in last year s local government elections.Political analyst Prince Mashele predicts a DA-led coalition in 2019, with Maimane as president and the EFF s Julius Malema as his deputy.With the red beret's firm on their seven non-negotiable cardinal policies, which include land expropriation without compensation, Maimane says they will never enter into any coalition with the party if it compromises the DA's values and principles. We would never work together to such a point that we suddenly would support nationalisation or we support whatever their policies are. He says the ANC, as it stands now, is not an option. You may find that there will be a breakaway, then the negotiations become different. I will not be working with an ANC that has the continuous view on Jacob Zuma. Last week, former DA leader Helen Zille warned the party against cosying up with parties that don't share its liberal sensibilities. Maimane says Zille should know that she has moved away from the party's principles.WATCH: Maimane's vision of 2019(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
