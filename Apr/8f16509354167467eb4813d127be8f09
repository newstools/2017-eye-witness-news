The Gupta family warned last week it would consider legal action against organisations planning to protest outside their function. JOHANNESBURG The Johannesburg Against Injustice (JAI) group has welcomed the Gupta family s decision to investigate protests outside the military museum, where it's holding a week-long religious event. Save SA supporters and the Black First Land First movement clashed during the demonstrations but the JAI insists its silent protest broke no laws. The Gupta family warned last week it would consider legal action against organisations planning to protest outside their function.Gupta family lawyer Gert van der Merwe says he will be conducting a complete analysis of the protests outside the military museum where the family is hosting their Khatha. If the consequences of the illegal conduct or the unlawful conduct of these individuals caused damages, my client will be entitled to recover those damages. But the JAI s Peggy Pillay says it is ironic because the Black First Land First movement, who were there in defence of the controversial family, are the ones who were singing and blocking traffic at the venue. We re very confident that we didn t violate any laws, that we stood by what we had intended to do which was silent and peaceful protest. The JAI has called on Hindu devotees attending the Khatha to stand against corruption.Meanwhile, Save SA s Themba Masango has reiterated the call from President Jacob Zuma to step down, and the controversial Gupta family to leave the country. How can criminals call for prayer when they are the ones looting government? We came here to make our voice heard, and to create a platform for our people to say: We are watching you and Jacob Gupta, your eldest brother, must leave the country. Save SA says these protests are some events the organisation has planned against Jacob Zuma.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
