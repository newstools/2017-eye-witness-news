The SACP believes images of a man appearing to point a gun at Solly Mapaila during Chris Hani's commemorate show an attempt to threaten him. JOHANNESBURG The South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary Blade Nzimande has condemned the brandishing of a gun on the party s Solly Mapaila, saying they'll defend him at all costs.Nzimande is addressing Cosatu s Gauteng provincial shop steward council in Johannesburg. The communist party believes images of a man appearing to point a gun at Mapaila during a ceremony to commemorate Chris Hani earlier this month show there was an attempt to threaten or intimidate its second deputy general secretary.Mapaila was booed and heckled by African National Congress supporters when he arrived at that ceremony. Our concern, first of all, is that how did the gun get there, when the president was there because it was not only a danger to Comrade Mapaila, but also to the president. It is suspicious that someone wanted to do something to Mapaila.
