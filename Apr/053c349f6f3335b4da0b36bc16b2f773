JOHANNESBURG A war over a trade union name is brewing between unions, the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) and the newly launched South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu)Fedusa says it has begun the process towards taking legal steps against newly formed Saftu.Fedusa says there are too many similarities that Saftu has to their name and this stands to steal from their brand.Saftu, led by former Congress of the South African Trade Union general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi was formally registered with the Labour Department this month.But Fedusa's Dennis George says their lawyers are busy drawing papers to take Saftu to court. If you look at Fedusa, and you have this thing being turned around to Saftu, so similarities for us are quite close. We are very concerned and that s why we decided to follow this particular route.
