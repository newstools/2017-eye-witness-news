Tottenham Hotspurs claimed a 12th consecutive Premier League home win. LONDON Tottenham Hotspur's tenacious chase of leaders Chelsea continued as they claimed a 12th consecutive Premier League home win with a 4-0 rout of Bournemouth on Saturday to cut the gap to four points.Two goals in three minutes from Mousa Dembele and Son Heung-min put the hosts in complete control inside 20 minutes and Harry Kane grabbed his 20th league goal of the season shortly after halftime as high-flying Spurs maintained their momentum.Substitute Vincent Janssen received the biggest roar of the day in stoppage time as he claimed his first Premier League goal from open play since joining last year.Mauricio Pochettino's side will now hope fifth-placed Manchester United can do them a favour by stopping Chelsea's seemingly unstoppable title charge at Old Trafford on Sunday.&quot;It was another great performance,&quot; Pochettino, whose side won 4-0 for the second Saturday running and now have six-goal better goal difference than Chelsea, told Sky Sports.&quot;Our job is done now, we have the three points and now we'll see what happens tomorrow. If (Chelsea) fail we are waiting.&quot;Dembele struck his first Premier League goal for 15 months after 16 minutes, slamming in a shot from six metres after Christian Eriksen's corner arrived through a crowd of players.In-form Son fired through the legs of keeper Artur Boruc from a narrow angle after racing on to Kane's deft flick.Kane, starting for the first time since injuring his ankle last month, wrapped up Tottenham's seventh successive league win after 48 minutes, turning Simon Francis all too easily and firing low past Boruc with his left foot.It is the third season in a row England forward Kane has reached the 20-goal mark - a feat previously only achieved by Alan Shearer, Ruud van Nistlerooy and Thierry Henry.Boruc made sure the score did not get too embarrassing for Bournemouth with several saves as Tottenham went through their routines but he was beaten again in stoppage time.Janssen, who has struggled to make an impact at White Hart Lane, scuffed his first attempt on goal but got another chance as the ball came back to him and the Dutchman fired past Boruc to put the icing on the cake of a 15th home league win.Bournemouth are seven points above the relegation zone before the later kickoffs and probably need one more victory to guarantee a third season of top-flight football.
