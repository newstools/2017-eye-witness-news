It is hoped the devices will offer the elephants extra protection from poachers. HARARE - Conservationists in one of Zimbabwe s top national parks, Mana Pools, are planning to put satellite tracking collars on more than a dozen bull elephants.It s hoped the devices will offer the elephants extra protection from poachers.For visitors to Mana Pools, lone bull elephants like the famous Boswell are a real drawcard.The Aware Trust says it s been given permission to fit satellite tracking collars on 14 of the bulls, and that data collected will allow the elephants' movements to be closely monitored.It was a satellite collar that first alerted researchers to the death of Cecil the lion two years ago near Hwange National Park, although his death was at the hands of an American hunter.Mana Pools, like much of the Zambezi Valley, has been hard-hit by elephant poaching and this project is seen as key in the battle to protect the species.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
