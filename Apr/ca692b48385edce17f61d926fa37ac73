An ANC member says they attacked them because they were being provocative. If they had a problem with Zuma, they must go to his house not our headquarters. Leaders of the ANCYL, the Women's League, and the MKMVA members are at the march and will address the crowd later. The Democratic Alliance (DA) decided not to march to Luthuli House and instead people are heading to Mary Fitzgerald Square.Meanwhile, there s a heavy police presence, with a South African Police Service helicopter dispatched for assistance.The DA has asked police to protect all its members protesting on Friday, adding that it will not go past Luthuli House.#DAmarch Johannesburg CBD.
