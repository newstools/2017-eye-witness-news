DA leader Mmusi Maimane has announced the party has decided to investigate Helen Zille's conduct related to tweets on colonialism. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has instituted formal disciplinary procedures against former leader Helen Zille.Her successor Mmusi Maimane referred the Western Cape Premier to the DA's legal commission last month after she tweeted that not all aspects of colonialism were negative.Getting onto an aeroplane now and won&#39;t get onto the wi-fi so that I can cut off those who think EVERY aspect of colonial legacy was bad.For those claiming legacy of colonialism was ONLY negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water etc.Zille met the legal commission, headed by Advocate Glynis Breytenbach, just over a week ago.WATCH: The DA's Mmusi Maimane announces that Helen Zille will face charges over colonialism tweets.It's not the first time Zille has found herself in the eye of a storm over her comments on Twitter.Late last year, she seemingly defended the use of race on a bill at The Bungalow, an upmarket Cape Town restaurant, when two patrons were identified as blacks on their invoice.In 2012, she caused controversy when she referred to children who moved from the Eastern Cape to the neighbouring Western Cape for a better education as &quot;refugees&quot;.Zille's latest case is complicated by the fact that while she has apologised on Twitter, she raised concerns about the DA's vision in a column in which she sets out her recent visit to Singapore.
