ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe and other top six leaders say they are satisfied with the president&#8217;s reasons for removing Pravin Gordhan. JOHANNESBURG - After publicly expressing their unhappiness with President Jacob Zuma s axing of Pravin Gordhan, African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe and other top six leaders say they are satisfied with the president s reasons for removing him. The party held a briefing at Luthuli House earlier on Wednesday following the National Working Committee (NWC) meeting. Mantashe says they have accepted the president's reason for axing Gordhan, which is that their relationship had broken down. He says the reason why Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa initially objected to Gordhan s removal, was because there were unhappy with the intelligence report as the sole reason the president cited as a reason for axing him. The issue of an intelligence report became a complication that caused unhappiness. Mantashe was asked if the president explained why he left underperforming ministers when he made changes to his cabinet. Ministers who do not perform should actually be looked into... actually we raised the issue with the president. Mantashe says disagreeing with the president publicly like he did, together with Ramaphosa and Mkhize, was a mistake that should never happen again.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
