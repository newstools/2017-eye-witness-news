We spoke to her knowing very well that in time for nominations was not yet open. Her response was that she would respond when they time came for nominations. Venkile adds they chose Sisulu, an ANC national executive committee member, because she's not &quot;tainted&quot;. Her name has not been mentioned in any scandalous thing in our country because our leadership has been accused of being corrupt and captured. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
