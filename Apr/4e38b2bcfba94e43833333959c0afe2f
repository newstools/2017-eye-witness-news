JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba says he has written to Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza, questioning him about what he calls reliable sources who claim he is blocking corruption investigations that the city is pursuing.However, the Hawks say they have not received the letter yet.Mashaba has launched various corruption probes in the past, in which city officials have been implicated, some of which have resulted in arrests.Mashaba says he has been reliably informed that Ntlemeza has asked Hawks officers to hand him the corruption cases involving city officials, so that he could make sure they are not prosecuted. That s why I wrote a letter to him to ask him if this information that s been reliably given is true. It s up to him to deny or confirm. But Hawks spokesperson Robert Netshiunda says Ntlemeza has called this 'pure nonsense'. The Hawks have got a responsibility to investigate alleged corruption at all levels. The Hawks say those behind these allegations are merely trying to push a certain agenda.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
