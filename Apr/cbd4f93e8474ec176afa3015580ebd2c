Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi says the RTMC has been ready to administer eNatis since May 2015 and Tasima has simply been unreasonable in this regard. JOHANNESBURG Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi has welcomed the high court s decision for the eNatis traffic system to be handed back to government immediately. The High Court in Pretoria on Monday ordered Tasima to hand over the keys to the property from where eNatis is managed as well as all data to ensure its smooth running. Maswanganyi says the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has been ready to administer eNatis since May 2015 and Tasima has simply been unreasonable in this regard. Their state of readiness has unreasonably been delayed and denied by the service provider, employing tactics informed by their desire to siphoned money from the state. He says the high court s decision vindicates government and proves that South Africa s justice system does work. The courts have vindicated us and Tasima must immediately hand over the eNatis system.
