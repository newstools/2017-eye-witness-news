At least three of Cosatu's unions have said they believe President Jacob Zuma should not speak at the event. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says it is now expecting President Jacob Zuma to arrive and to speak at its main May Day rally in the Free State on Monday, and that it expects its members to be disciplined when he gives that address.At least three of Cosatu's unions have said they believe Zuma should not speak at the event, because the federation has taken a resolution that he should step down as president.However, other unions say that no decision has been made to ban the leader of the ANC from speaking at Cosatu rallies.Cosatu's Sizwe Pamla says this decision to allow Zuma to speak at their main rally on Monday does not contradict their resolution that he should step down as president. We do have a standing decision coming from the special CEC, but that decision was never extended to mean the president should step down from his position as the leader of the ANC. While the ANC's Zizi Kodwa says Zuma will go to Bloemfontein. Cosatu affirmed and confirmed that they areexpecting the president. Of course, affiliates of Cosatu have got a right to their views, but it does not make it a view of Cosatu. But this issue could put more strain on divisions at the top of Cosatu's leadership, with at least one union suggesting Cosatu president S'dumo Dlamini should resign because of his continued support for Zuma.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
