Fransman failed to attend a scheduled NDC hearing on Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) National Disciplinary Committee (NDC) has affirmed its earlier position that Marius Fransman remain on suspension.Fransman failed to attend a scheduled NDC hearing on Wednesday.The committee in November found he abused his office after attempting to obtain sexual favours from his then personal assistant Louisa Wynand. It also found Fransman brought the party into disrepute in light of statements he made publicly. ANC National Communications Manager Khusela Sangoni also expressed disappointment that Fransman informed the public he was cleared by the NDC, when in fact he was not. This is the final process; the matter had been referred back to the NDC by appeals committee who had insisted that in order to protect the integrity of the ANC, we must ensure that there is on procedural irregularities. Once the matter has been decided by the NDC it is final. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
