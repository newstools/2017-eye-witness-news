LONDON - Lewis Hamilton stopped by the panda research sanctuary in Chengdu, China, on Tuesday.The Formula 1 racing driver is set to compete in this week s Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai but was keen to get some sightseeing in before the pressure ramps up over the next few days, and took the opportunity to see the Panda Nursery House and its iPanda HQ, where he took control of the enclosure cameras.And his excursions didn t stop there as he then stopped by a traditional restaurant on Wide and Narrow Street, which the president of Germany also recently visited, to learn how to make sweet sticky rice balls.His day of sightseeing drew to a close with lots of food as he stopped by the famous Sichuan Hot Pot restaurant Chengdu Huangcheng Laoma, previously visited by Michelle Obama, and the Shunxing Old Teahouse restaurant to sample more Sichuan Cuisine and take in the famous Sichuan Opera shows.Speaking of his exciting trip, he said: Today has enhanced my love for China and its people, its values and culture; Chengdu is a beautiful city and I can t wait to come back. It s not known if Lewis is joined in China by his rumoured girlfriend Sofia Richie or whether the 18-year-old model will jet out to Shanghai later this week to watch the hunk whiz around the track in his fast car.The pair - who have a 14-year age gap between them - sparked rumours they were dating in February when they were spotted enjoying a cosy meal at Sugarfish and the Montage Hotel in Los Angeles.Lewis may be known for his racing skills but his love life always seems to be the hot topic of conversation as he s previously been romantically linked to Rita Ora, Winnie Harlow and model Barbara Palvin.Prior to that, he was in a long-term on-off relationship with Nicole Scherzinger but they went their separate ways in 2015 and the Pussycat Dolls singer went on to date tennis player Grigor Dimitrov.
