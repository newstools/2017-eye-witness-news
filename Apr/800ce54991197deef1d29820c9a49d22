JOHANNESBURG - Newly Appointed Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says he wants to ensure there's continuity at National Treasury, especially in terms of management. When addressing local investors in Cape Town on Thursday Gigaba indicated that he ll be looking for a cool headed, strong professional to fill the post of director general. Outgoing DG Lungisa Fuzile is leaving Treasury in mid-May and his position will be advertised in newspapers from this weekend. Gigaba has tried to assure the nation and international investors that he's not going to implement drastic changes at National Treasury. He's also referred to the credit rating's downgrade as a set back but insists that now is not the time to be despondent. Gigaba will have to appoint a new director general when Fuzile leaves Treasury next month, and the minister says he'll start looking within the department. He wants someone credible, in line with Fuzile to manage the institution - and someone who has the right mental, intellectual and moral attitude to withstand the pressure of the job and to support him as minister.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
