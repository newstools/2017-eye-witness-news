In light of the Constitutional Court's directives, the parties have asked for next Tuesday's debate to be postponed. CAPE TOWN - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has backed a request by the United Democratic Movement (UDM) to postpone next week's motion of no confidence in the National Assembly. Both parties have written to the Speaker Baleka Mbete that the vote be held off until directives by the Constitutional Court have been complied with.While the Democratic Alliance (DA) has not officially requested a postponement, it says delaying the motion would be wise in light of the pending court matter.The motion was first brought by DA leader Mmusi Maimane in the wake of President Zuma's late night Cabinet reshuffle, backed by the EFF and the UDM.But in light of Constitutional Court directives issued on Tuesday, which give parties in the matter until 21 April to file their written submissions, the parties have now asked for next Tuesday's debate to be postponed.DA chief whip John Steenhuise says the party has also written to Speaker Baleka Mbete, saying it would support a postponement. If we proceed with the motion, prior to the court expressing itself, it s going to render the whole question mute anyway. Steenhuisen says the party does not want to see the debate delayed for too much longer, fearing that it could strengthen Zuma's support within the party. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
