JOHANNESBURG - The Presidency has moved to clarify that the decision to postpone the memorial service of late struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada was not made by President Jacob Zuma, but by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. It says on the eve of the scheduled memorial event, Ramaphosa was of the view that inadequate preparations had been made to enable a successful official memorial service. The Deputy President was also concerned about last week's political developments in the country and thought a postponement was required to afford South Africans an opportunity to honour Kathrada. The memorial service was scheduled for Saturday, but postponed in the late afternoon on Friday. Ramaphosa's spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepa says: The interministerial committee duly effected the postponement. The Presidency then commentated the proposal for the postponement to the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation. President Zuma was not involved in any of these processes. Meanwhile, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has called on South Africans to be part of Friday s march to the Union Buildings, calling on Zuma to step down. The foundation's Zaakira Vadi said: The foundation will be supporting the march to the Union Buildings. This move has been initiated by various civil society organisations and we re calling on all members of society to support the march. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
