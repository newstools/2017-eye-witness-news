JOHANNESBURG - As the country marks Freedom Day, civil society groups, trade unions and opposition parties have expressed differing views about its significance. Thursday marks exactly 23 years since the country s first democratic election.The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) urged citizens to hold the government to its commitment for a better life for all.The federation's Sdumo Dlamini says South Africans should guard the freedom that so many died for. We ll always defend this freedom and we re not prepared to hand the country back to our former colonisers. Meanwhile, Congress of the People s Dennis Bloem says it s unfortunate that President Jacob Zuma has tarnished this day. It s very sad to say that today we can t celebrate Freedom Day. We re sitting with a person who doesn t have any interest in the well-being of this country. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
