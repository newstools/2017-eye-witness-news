Lindiwe Sisulu cautions if the ANC goes into its December elective conference fractured, it will lose membership CAPE TOWN African National Congress (ANC) NEC member Lindiwe Sisulu has warned the party's leadership cannot allow the liberation movement to hit rock bottom and lose its support. Sisulu, who's also Human Settlements Minister, delivered the Lillian Ngoyi memorial lecture in Khayelitsha on Saturday - an event seen by some as part of a campaign for the ANC Presidency.She reiterated concerns raised by party stalwarts, former leaders and supporters must be addressed and not dismissed.The ANC NEC member cautions if the ANC goes into its December elective conference fractured, it will lose membership in the same way it did after Polokwane in 2007. We will disagree on a regular basis but we are united under the banner of the ANC. Let us retain the dignity we have because every time we get to a place like Polokwane, we lose some of our members. Sisulu, however, believes the ANC has the resilience and grassroots support to overcome its current troubles. Although she has expressed concern, She is confident the party will remain in power after 2019. At the same time, the Human Settlements Minister has confirmed she's had to get additional security for herself following apparent death threats against her.Reports surfaced that the ANC NEC member's name was on a hit list, along with deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. Sisulu says she received intelligence in June last year that her life was in danger. I have not yet confirmed it but I have taken all the necessary precautions to make sure that I protect myself. I am capable of protecting myself but that doesn t discount nay other protection there may be. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
