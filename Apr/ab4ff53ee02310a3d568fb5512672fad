The City of Johannesburg is planning to lay criminal charges against at least 10 people for the violent disruptions at the meeting on Tuesday. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) Johannesburg has refuted claims that its councillors or members are behind the violent disruptions of a meeting hosted by Mayor Herman Mashaba in Midrand. The City of Johannesburg is planning to lay criminal charges against at least 10 people who stormed the integrated development plan summit on Tuesday, throwing bricks and other objects inside the venue, preventing Mashaba from speaking.The CoJ is left with no option but to lay criminal charges against ANC councillors who were leading this assault and fuelling the violence.Mashaba says ANC councillors were part of the group, but the ANC says it has video footage showing that the Economic Freedom Fighters caused the disruptions.Disgracefully, this attack on our democracy was led by ANC Councillors in the City of Joburg.The party s Jolidee Matongo says: &quot;None of the people who were there wore an ANC t-shirt. Those were members of the public who were attending the meeting; members of the Economic Freedom Fighters attacked a member of the community and violence broke out.&quot;WATCH: Caught on camera: Political clashes in MidrandWarning: this video contains scenes of violenceMashaba says he also has footage and insists it was ANC members It s very very unfortunate. Ten of their councillors also participated in this thuggery of making sure that I don t get to present the plan. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
