JOHANNESBURG - Political analysts say if the government continues with the nuclear deal, it may be seen as having total disregard for the country s economic wellbeing.The City Press reported on Sunday that a timetable has been set up for bidders to be invited. However, Eskom has denied this, saying it is still reviewing the feasibility of the programme.Political analyst Tinyiko Maluleke says South African's mistrust of government may be causing major doubt around the nuclear deal. The reason being corruption may be implied and is behind this particular deal given the amounts of money. Who stands to benefit from it? At the same time, analyst Benedict Dube says the government needs to answer to the South African people and give clarity on why it is so adamant to pass this deal. Our government is a pawn, used by multinational companies who are fighting to get hold of a stake in this tender. Analysts say as it is yet to be seen whether the request for proposals will be published, the government should be ready to give clear reasons on whatever decision is made.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
