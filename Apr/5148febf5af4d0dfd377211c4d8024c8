President Zuma told ANC supporters not to worry when South Africans or opposition parties march against him.He says he is not moved because he s been hated and called names before. We grew up being called names, people calling us things we are not they think doing the same today will hurt us, no we are not hurt. We know this, we have been named before.

I don't know that, we don't have that in Zulu.
