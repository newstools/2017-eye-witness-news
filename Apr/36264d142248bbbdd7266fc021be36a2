On Monday, the High Court in Pretoria set aside the decision by former Transport Minister Dipuo Peters to dissolve the Prasa board. JOHANNESBURG Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board Chairman Popo Molefe says he will now continue his fight against mismanagement and corruption after succeeding in having his board at the rail agency reinstated.On Monday, the High Court in Pretoria set aside the decision by former Transport Minister Dipuo Peters to dissolve the board after acting CEO Collins Letsoalo was fired for increasing his salary by 350% without approval.The court found that the board members proved that they had the right to challenge the minister s decision.Molefe argued that if the board was removed, their internal investigation could not be completed successfully and they had already uncovered irregular expenditure of about R14 billion.He insisted that the removal of the board erodes the intimate knowledge of these investigations.The court agreed and Molefe and his board members have been reinstated, while the appointment of the interim board headed by former Sanral CEO Nazir Alli, has been set aside.The ministry has been ordered to pay costs.At the same time, the Transport Department says it hasn t yet determined its next move regarding the Prasa court judgment.The department s Ishmael Mnisi says: We note the court order and we re going to determine what our next move will be, however, its content and its decision as it stands is welcomed by the department. Further action from our side will be done after we ve studied this court judgment. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
