The latest evidence shows that between 2014 and 2016, acting top cop Khomotso Phahlane sold or traded in several cars and was paid well above the book price. PRETORIA The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has filed a fresh affidavit, revealing numerous suspicious car purchase transactions involving acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane which the police watchdog has described as dubious.It's the latest in the tug of war between the top cop and Ipid.Earlier this year, Phahlane approached the High Court in Pretoria after his house was raided asking it to declare the search warrant unlawful and invalid.The latest evidence shows that between 2014 and last year, Lieutenant General Phahlane sold or traded in several cars and was paid well above the book price for the vehicles.In one instance, the dealership paid Phahlane R650,000 for a Land Rover which was only worth R550,000.In another deal, the dealership paid the acting commissioner R550,000 for a Mercedes-Benz which at the time was only valued at R320,000. While Phahlane admitted earlier this year that he was using a bakkie sponsored by a car dealership, it has now emerged he was in fact using two sponsored vehicles, the second one being a VW Polo. Ipid investigator Mandlakayise Mahlangu says the information reveals dubious transactions in Phahlane s finacial affairs and shows there is clearly a case to be investigated.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
