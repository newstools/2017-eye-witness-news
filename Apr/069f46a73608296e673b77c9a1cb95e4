Mantashe spoke at a Chris Hani memorial lecture in the North West, organised by the Young Communist League as part of the ANC's political education programme. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said on Saturday that divisions within the tripartite alliance would result in the ruling party losing political power in the next general election.Mantashe spoke at a Chris Hani memorial lecture in the North West, organised by the Young Communist League as part of the ANC's political education programme.He said tensions were caused by emotional decisions which did not make political sense. So if a party delivers divorce papers to the ANC, [it s] very emotional. The ANC will accept the divorce papers but the net effect is that we re both weak. Mantashe added that the tripartite alliance was fractured and no longer solid. There is no organisation in South Africa that can challenge this movement on the basis of superiority of policies. Our policies are correct and superior. They can t be challenged. But we create a space for enemies to attack us, which exploit our own mistakes. The alliance consists of the ANC, Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
