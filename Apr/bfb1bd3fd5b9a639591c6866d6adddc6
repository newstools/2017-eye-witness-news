Jobodwana will be taking part in his first championships since 2015 after missing out on last year&#8217;s event. JOHANNESBURG - South African sprint sensation Anaso Jobodwana will be one of the athletes to watch at this weekend s national championships in Potchefstroom, but he s chosen to keep a low profile in the build-up to the major event to focus on himself.Jobodwana will be taking part in his first championships since 2015 after missing out on last year s event.The 24-year-old had a 2016 season to forget as he failed to live up to his potential in the 200m event, failing to even make the semi-finals.He burst onto the scene two years ago when he finished third at the World Championships in Beijing behind Usain Bolt and Justin Gatlin, but has struggled to kick on from there.Jobodwana will take part in the 100m and 200m events where he ll go up against the fastest man in the country in the 100m, Akani Simbine and the 400m world record holder Wayde van Niekerk, among others.He says he doesn t want to get ahead of himself going into the competition, to avoid jinxing his performances with an injury. Coming off the 2015 season, I got excited about the Olympics because I got a medal and I knew that I could get another medal at the games, but it all just came falling down to pieces in two or three days. The 800m Olympic gold medalist Caster Semenya and Olympic silver medalist in the long jump, Luvo Manyonga, will be some other big name athletes in the spotlight.(Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
