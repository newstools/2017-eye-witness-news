If he s not going to be there, his presence will be missed but in saying that, I think the coach knows he can trust his players because of the belief he instilled in us and courage he gives us every day at training, how we must play and whatever happens, we are going to miss his big presence during the match. Defender Clayton Daniels says the senior players need to be counted now that the coach is out. That s where our experience comes in and to make sure the youngsters learn from us, especially when the main boss is not there. It s important for us to keep everyone alert and ourselves because we know the importance of these kind of games. Defender Clayton Daniels says their Nedbank Cup win over Kaizer Chiefs has got them back on track. Now the mood is much better after the win against Kaizer Chiefs. I found our identity back again, the way we play, and the way we do things came back. We lost ourselves in the past league games but we bounced back and we re happy that we re on that level of thinking and mentality. So we re excited for our game tomorrow [Tuesday].
