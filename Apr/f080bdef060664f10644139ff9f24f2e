Two strangers with opposite views meet in this Heineken ad, which gets political in a way that Pepsi would do well to consider next time. JOHANNESBURG A thought-provoking new advertisement from beer maker Heineken just showed Pepsi how a beverage company can comment on social issues.Two strangers with opposite views meet in this Heineken ad, which gets political in a way that Pepsi would do well to consider next time.Earlier this month, Pepsi came up with an ad which used the Black Lives Matter campaign and Kendall Jenner to suggest that fizzy drinks can heal America s wounds.Pepsi was on the receiving end of a social media backlash and it pulled the ad almost instantly. In the Heineken ad, six people state their strong beliefs that men are oppressed, the fight for feminism is far from over; that climate change is real or piffle ; that transgender people need a voice and that transgender is nonsense semantics.The unaware candidates are then paired with their opposites and sent together into warehouses, where they found themselves with some instructions and a piece of furniture to build a bar.They are then given a choice to go, or stay and discuss your differences over a beer .All six choose to hash it out respectfully; one pair is even shown swapping numbers.
