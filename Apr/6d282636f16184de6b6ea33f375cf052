Marius Fransman was suspended for five years relating to sexual harassment allegations. CAPE TOWN - There appears to be a stand-off within the African National Congress (ANC) Western Cape leadership after Marius Fransman declared his return as provincial chairperson.Fransman was suspended for five years after the ANC's national disciplinary committee last year found him guilty of bringing the party into disrepute relating to sexual harassment allegations.An appeal's committee earlier this month ruled the disciplinary process must be partially re-done but it's unclear whether that means Fransman's suspension has been lifted.Fransman used the ANC provincial offices to hold a media briefing and to meet disgruntled party veterans on Monday morning. Fransman claims he s back in the chairperson s office. The fact that some are trying to keep me out because they want a regime change, that s different story. But structurally based on a constitutional I m still elected a legitimate leader of the ANC. But PEC spokesperson Lionel Adendorf says they have received a report on the matter. It is not within our realms and, therefore, we do not have an opinion on it because it is within the authority of the nationally disciplinary committee. Fransman will now have to submit documents to the disciplinary committee to support his claim that the process was biased against him.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
