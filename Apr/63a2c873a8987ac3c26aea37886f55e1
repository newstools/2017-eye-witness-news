The ACM says it will continue filing its contempt of court action against the league while insists there's no evidence to prove their members were responsible. DURBAN The KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) says it's investigating whether any of its members were involved in disruptions at the Ahmed Kathrada memorial but will not be issuing an apology to the family prematurely.This comes as the Active Citizens Movement (ACM) says it will continue filing its contempt of court action against the league. The ACM went to court ahead of Kathrada's memorial seeking to have the organisation's members banned from attending. They were granted permission to be at the proceedings on condition that there be no disruptions.The KZN ANCYL s Thanduxolo Sabela insists there's no evidence to prove their members were responsible for the heckling. We stand by our view of not issuing an apology prematurely and if they want to meet us in court, we have a competent team of lawyers which will represent and we will state our side of our story in court. We don t believe we are in contempt of any court. The ACM'S Yashica Padia says there won't be any further negotiations until the youth league apologises. We will meet with them once an apology is provided by the ANCYL. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
