The amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism has taken the law that governs the interception of communications to court. JOHANNESBURG - There's no response yet from government to the legal application by the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism to have the law that governs when communications can be intercepted declared unconstitutional. On Thursday, amaBhungane announced it was taking the law known as Rica to court. It says the current law makes it too easy for police officers and intelligence services to find ways to tap someone s phone or monitor their messages without them knowing. The Right2Know group s Murray Hunter says they re supporting this application. We ve seen mounting evidence that the state surveillance powers have been used and abused to target journalists, political activists, community service delivery and activists.
