The Black First Land First (BLF) Movement says the attacks on the Gupta family are directed by white monopoly capital. JOHANNESBURG - The Black First Land First (BLF) Movement has come to the defence of the controversial Gupta family, saying they have every right to host a week-long religious event in Saxonwold.There have been calls from civil organisations for members of the community to boycott the event, which is being held at the military museum.Protesters for and against the family clashed on Sunday, with police intervening.BLF s Zanele Lwana says the attacks on the Gupta family are directed by white monopoly capital. We are here to send a clear message to Johann Rupert and his agents, that he seems to be mobilising to come and disrupt this event, that no white settler has nay grounds to declare any religious war to any black person. But Johannesburg Against Injustice's (JAI) Peggy Pillay says it's ironic that the controversial family is hosting such an event. The Guptas are using religion to try and make it seem as though they follow a path of righteousness and from everything that s in the public domain, it s very evident that they don t follow a path of righteousness. While Save SA and JAI have both vowed to continue their silent protests, the BLF has promised to confront them.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
