JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the appointment of professor Chris Malikane as the Finance Minister s economic advisor, reinforces the perception that there'll be a major shift in investor policy, which could shake investor confidence.Malikane is linked to the Wits' Hugo Chaves school of economics.The DA says that in its self suggests that Malikane holds orthodox views which promote radical economic transformation rather than inclusive growth.Shadow finance minister David Maynier says his appointment may see further downgrades by ratings agencies. The appointment is a logical consequence of the minister s political agenda and we tend to take on unorthodox appointments at Treasury.
