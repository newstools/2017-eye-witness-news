JOHANNESBURG - Newly installed Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says Treasury will address concerns raised by the rating agencies.He is currently holding a media briefing at the Treasury offices.The minister is responding to credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor s Global Ratings decision on Monday to downgrade South Africa's credit rating to junk status.Moody's on Monday night also announced that it was placing the country s sovereign credit rating on review.Gigaba says the country is not under junk status until all three of the main rating agencies agree. What this means, as I said at the conclusion of my statement, is that it is a setback. But we have no reason to be despondent. It basically means that a number of variables now have to be considered. We have to look out for inflation, the rise in interest rates and a number of things. Gigaba added that he knew the country would be downgraded, as S&amp;P Global had told him in confidence. Gigaba says the focus now should be on supporting the private business sector.Gigaba knew S&amp;P would announce a downgrade to junk status even when he told a briefing on Monday that Cabinet changes would not have any impact.He's revealed he knew about the pending downgrade and had conversations with other ratings agencies. We decided to talk to the agencies that had not made their decision. The S&amp;P was water under the bridge. Gigaba says South Africa can manage the political and policy risks raised by S&amp;P Global.
