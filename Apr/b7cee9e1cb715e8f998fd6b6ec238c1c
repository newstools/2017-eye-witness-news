Judge Peter Mabuse has reinstated the board with immediate effect after Dipuo Peters dissolved it last month. JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Pretoria has found that Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board members had every right to challenge the transport minister s decision to dissolve the board - and it's in the public's interest that corruption is exposed and rooted out.The court reinstated Popo Molefe as chairman of the board and his fellow board members, who had argued that their removal would jeopardise an internal investigation involving irregular expenditure at Prasa.Former transport minister Dipuo Peters dissolved the board last month after acting CEO Collins Letsoalo was fired for increasing his salary by 350% without approval.Molefe and the Prasa board members have argued that their internal investigation, which has revealed irregular expenditure of about R14 billion, would have been compromised if they were not reinstated.Judge Peter Mabuse says they proved they had a right to challenge the minister's decision, saying Prasa must be properly regulated, independent of government's interference.Mabuse has reinstated the board with immediate effect and the appointment of the interim board headed by former Sanral CEO Nazir Alli has been set aside.The Transport Department says it s still studying the judgment and will comment in due course.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
