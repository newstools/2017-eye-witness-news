The status quo in North Korea is also unacceptable, Trump told a meeting with the 15 UN Security Council ambassadors, including China and Russia, at the White House. The council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs. South Korean and US officials have feared for some time that a sixth North Korean nuclear test could be imminent. Speculation has grown that such a test, or another long-range missile launch, could coincide with the 85th anniversary of the foundation of the North s Korean People s Army on Tuesday.The official China Daily said on Tuesday it was time for Pyongyang and Washington to take a step back from harsh rhetoric and heed the voices of reason calling for a peaceful resolution. Judging from their recent words and deeds, policymakers in Pyongyang have seriously misread the UN sanctions, which are aimed at its nuclear/missile provocations, not its system or leadership, the newspaper said in an editorial. They are at once perilously overestimating their own strength and underestimating the hazards they are brewing for themselves, it said.In a phone conversation with Trump on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for all sides to exercise restraint.Two Japanese destroyers conducted exercises on Monday with a US aircraft carrier strike group that is also headed for Korean waters, sent by Trump as a warning to the North.Trump has also sought to pressure China to do more to rein in its nuclear-armed neighbour.China, North Korea s sole major ally, has in turn been angered by Pyongyang s belligerence, as well as its nuclear and missile programmes.Regardless, North Korea has carried out nuclear and missile tests in defiance of successive rounds of United Nations sanctions.Angered by the approach of the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group, which could arrive within days, North Korea said the deployment was an extremely dangerous act by those who plan a nuclear war to invade . The United States should not run amok and should consider carefully any catastrophic consequence from its foolish military provocative act, Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea s ruling Workers Party, said in a commentary.
