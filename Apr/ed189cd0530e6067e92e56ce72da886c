The UDM is seeking direct access to the court for a secret ballot, which opposition parties hope will see President Zuma removed from office. CAPE TOWN National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has until 4pm on Tuesday to file her response to the Constitutional Court in a matter in which the United Democratic Movement (UDM) is trying to have next Tuesday s vote of no confidence held in secret.The UDM approached the court on Monday.Mbete rejected a request by the party for a secret vote last week. This is after she agreed to reconvene Parliament at the request of several opposition parties to debate of vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says: Generally our responses will be informed by the same response that was taken because the Speaker s responsibility is to uphold the Constitution as well as apply the rules of the Assembly as they are. And in this particular case, they don t make provision for a motion of no confidence to be made through a secret ballot. Mbete has set the debate down for 18 April, after requests from the opposition as part of widespread action sparked by Zuma's Cabinet reshuffle.Parliament says neither the Constitution nor the Rules of the Assembly provide for a vote of no confidence to be conducted by secret ballot and the Speaker has no authority in law to alter such provisions.Mothapo said: Secret ballot is only required when a president is elected into office and when there is a challenger for that particular position. It is within that regard, that Parliament will not agree to the particular proposition of the UDM. Mbete confirmed that she has been served papers by the UDM on the matter of a secret vote during the motion of no confidence.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says it wants to be sure that all Members of Parliament will vote freely without intimidation from their parties when the motion is debated.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
