Calls to her mobile number went unanswered. Television images showed her weeping and holding the dead baby.A regional Facebook representative in Singapore was not immediately available to comment.After the company faced a backlash for showing the video of the Cleveland killing, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would do all it could to prevent such content in the future.Thai netizens voiced outrage about the clips showing the child's killing.&quot;This is the most evil clip I've seen in my life,&quot; said one user, Avada Teeraponkoon. &quot;I couldn't stand it for more than one second.&quot;&quot;How can he watch his own child stop breathing?&quot; said another, Rujirek Polglang. &quot;He should have just died alone.&quot;The killing was the first in Thailand known to be broadcast on the social networking site, said Thai deputy police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen.&quot;It could be influenced by behaviour from abroad, most recently in Cleveland,&quot; Kissana told Reuters.Before they were taken down, the first video had drawn 112,000 views by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, while the second video showed 258,000 views.
