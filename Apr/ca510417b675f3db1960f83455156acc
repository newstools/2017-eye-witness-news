Earlier, President Jacob Zuma called on South Africans to be united in the midst of frustration and misunderstanding and allow tolerance and peaceful co-existence.Zuma was addressing the 24th anniversary of Hani's death in Boksburg.President Zuma said the demonstrations against him last week, with protestors using racist posters, show that racism is still alive in the country.He then called for unity. We should never forget that one of the trademarks of South Africa s transition to democracy was tolerance and peaceful co-existence. We must tolerate one another. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
