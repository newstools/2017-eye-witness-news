ACDP leader Kenneth Meshoe says Parliament needs to express its view on the matter before it reaches the Constitutional Court. CAPE TOWN - The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) wants an urgent parliamentary debate on the implications of a ruling by the Western Cape High Court that will allow for the smoking and growing of dagga at home. ACDP leader Kenneth Meshoe says Parliament needs to express its view on the matter before it reaches the Constitutional Court. The ACDP leader says he believes the majority of South Africans don't want dagga decriminalised and legalised for private use, given the high number of young people battling drug addiction, and it's important for Parliament to make its position known as soon as possible.A ruling handed down by the Western Cape High Court earlier in April has given Parliament two years to make amendments to the Drug Trafficking Act and the Medical and Related Substances Act.But the ruling will first have to be confirmed by the Constitutional Court.Meshoe says families are being destroyed by drugs and he doesn't believe the Constitutional Court should confirm the ruling. We cannot, as concerned leaders in South Africa, wait and see our families and our children being broken down because of addiction to dagga and dangerous drugs like nyaope. He says if necessary, civil society will have to be lobbied to make their voices heard on the streets.
