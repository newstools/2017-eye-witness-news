Lieutenant General Berning Ntlemeza reported for duty on Monday morning despite the minister announcing that he longer holds the top post with the Hawks. PRETORIA - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula is expected at the Hawks headquarters in Silverton on Monday afternoon to address concerns around Berning Ntlemeza. The lieutenant general reported for duty on Monday morning despite the minister announcing that he longer holds the top post. Mbalula appointed an acting head of the Hawks following the High Court ruling which found that Ntlemeza is neither fit nor proper for the position. The Police Minister has made it clear that he no longer considers Ntlemeza as the head of the Hawks. He appointed Ntlemeza s deputy, Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata, to act in the top post until a permanent appointment is made. Ntlemeza slipped into the offices through a back entrance to avoid journalists who were waiting for him. It s understood he was accompanied by his attorney. The Democratic Alliance has urged Mbalula to deal decisively with Ntlemeza which does appear to be his stance given Monday s impromptu visit to the unit s head offices.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
