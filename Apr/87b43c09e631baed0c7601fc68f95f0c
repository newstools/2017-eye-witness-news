Neeshan Balton of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation says South Africans want Zuma to go because he embodies corruption. JOHANNESBURG The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation says the reason many South Africans want President Jacob Zuma to be removed is because he embodies corruption.The organisation's Neeshan Balton says ethical leadership and an accountable government will remain a myth if Zuma stays in office.Balton spoke at the serious social investment conference at the Wits Business School in Johannesburg. The removal of Zuma is important. But in the process of this mobilisation is ethical leadership and accountable government and developing a consciousness around the issue of corruption that must entrench the widest fear of society. This is real, and at the face of this reality is the president.
