37 independent energy producers have once again been left in the dark after waiting almost two years for Eskom to conclude their contracts. CAPE TOWN Thirty-seven independent renewable energy producers have once again been left in the dark after waiting almost two years for Eskom to conclude their contracts. The utility has signed more than 60 such contracts already.The South African Renewable Energy Council has raised concerns over the latest delay, which is due to the appointment of a new energy minister following President Jacob Zuma's recent Cabinet reshuffle.The council's Brenda Martin says the delays have cost at least R80 million. We had invited the minister of energy to attend the signature of those contracts today were informed over the weekend that the minister would like to postpone because she would like to meet with the minister of public enterprises over the previous minister s instruction to Eskom. Eskom has been accused of deliberately delaying the process in the past, but spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says they remain committed to the programme. We have taken a decision as a company to sign the renewable energy contracts. So far, we already have about 64 and we re just waiting for clarity from government on the others.
