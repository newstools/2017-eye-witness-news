ANC treasurer Zweli Mkhize says doesn't believe the ANC is about to split into different pieces. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) treasurer Zweli Mkhize has told Eyewitness News he doesn t believe the party will split after its December conference because its members and leaders now have their best interests served inside one party.He's given a wide-ranging interview to EWN in which he's discussed issues of leadership, the tensions in the party and the ratings downgrades.Mkhize says that while ANC leaders and members may be critical of each other now, they will know there is a line they cannot cross without seriously damaging the party. I believe there is enough sense on all the members to realise when it is too dangerous to continue with decisive activities and that everyone is going to want to work together. And he says he doesn't believe the ANC is about to split into different pieces. At the end of the day I don t have a sense that we ve got people who are sitting inside the ANC and are preparing to go and create a breakaway party. Mkhize says this is a difficult time for the party but that it will overcome its problems.WATCH: Zweli Mkhize: It's pretty hectic in the ANC at the momentANTI-ZUMA PROTESTSThe ANC treasurer says the party and its national executive committee need to seriously consider the message that's been sent to the party by the people who held protests against President Jacob Zuma. Tens of thousands of people marched first in a Save SA protest and then in an opposition party march to the Union Buildings to demonstrate against the removal of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister.Zuma has said the marches showed racism was still alive in South Africa, while Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Twitter the marches were rubbish, before saying that tweet was an error.Mkhize say the number of people who joined these marches shows that they must be taken seriously. I must say, the issues that they ve raised are issue that we will take seriously because some of them are related to the ratings downgrade, which is an issue all of us must take into account. So when people raise it, it is a concern. He also says he didn't see Dlamini-Zuma's tweets and didn't see protestors bearing racist placards.But Mkhize says if people did use the marches to make racist comments, that must be condemned.WATCH: Tens of thousands march for Zuma's resignation(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
