Economist Xhanti Payi believes SA has not exploited the potential of individuals to enhance the economy through work and talent. JOHANNESBURG - Standing in for Redi Tlhabi on Freedom Day, Bongani Bingwa speaks to economist Xhanti Payi about what South Africa needs to do in order to one day achieve economic freedom.Payi says achieving radical economic transformation - a term that has been popularised by President Jacob Zuma and his party in recent weeks - means reversing the 'sin' of apartheid, which is the exclusion of blacks from education, economic activity and employment. He says this can be done through the discussion of macro issues pertaining to the economy and finding ways to tap into the potential of various sectors such as agriculture and tourism.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
