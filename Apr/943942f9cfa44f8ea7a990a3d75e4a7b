Radovan Krejcir's extradition to the Czech Republic has been prevented because of other parallel criminal cases and appeals. JOHANNESBURG - An extradition hearing for Czech Radovan Krejcir appears to now be a reality after years of delays and postponements. Krejcir appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrates Court on Friday in his extradition matter and on separate charges of attempting to escape from prison, both cases were postponed. For nearly a decade, a hearing to have Krejcir extradited to the Czech Republic has been prevented because of other parallel criminal cases and appeals and attempts by the media to intervene. But now all of these impediments have been cleared, giving the green light for the hearing to take place. The State is hopeful this could happen within the next few months. Meanwhile, Krejcir has again raised concerns about his prison conditions, complaining he's being kept in solitary confinement in the basement of Kgosi Mampuru Prison, his eardrum has been perforated by a prison doctor - and he's been unable to see a psychiatrist. Krejcir wants prison officials to appear before the court to account for the conditions in which he is being kept. He says it is inhumane that he's being held in solitary confinement in the basement of the Kgosi Mampuru the second prison. The inspectorate of prisons is currently looking into his complaints.
