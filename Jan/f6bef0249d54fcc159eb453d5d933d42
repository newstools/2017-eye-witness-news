Centurion Dean Elgar believes more than one Test per year should be played in Cape Town. CAPE TOWN - Centurion Dean Elgar believes that more than one Test per year should be played in Cape Town. The left handed opening batsman made his sixth Test century at Newlands, which helped the Proteas to 297/6 at stumps on Day 1. Speaking after his heroics, which were watched by 14,650 Mother City fans, Elgar believes that playing only one Test in Cape Town is a disservice to venue. We could play more Tests in Cape Town to be honest with you, I think just playing one Test a year is actually a little bit rude on the Newlands crowd because they do come out and support. They do prepare good wickets, which is what we want as cricketers. The gritty opener spoke glowingly about the environment of the ground and says the players anticipate a great atmosphere at Newlands and this acts as encouragement to the team. #CSAnews Century releases some of Elgar&#39;s frustrations https://t.co/2sMQabmoZR pic.twitter.com/ixWGmlOmwk The support is also massive for us, and the players feed off that because we know, we hear the talk that it s going to be a sell-out day one and day two etc. and it s great, I think it awesome. In Port Elizabeth, the first day crowd was 6,700 while the first day crowd at Newlands was more than double that. Elgar touched on the effect a bigger crowd can have on the players. It s a little sad when you play at a smaller venue for instance and there is not a lot of support. Newlands has never failed to be honest with you. It s always great crowd support, there is always good chat and it s just picturesque and as a player you always want to come back.
