Political analyst professor Lesiba Teffo says the party must make sure it does not focus on the past on Sunday. JOHANNESBURG - As political analysts wait to see if the African National Congress s January 8 statement will provide insight into power dynamics within the party s National Executive Committee (NEC), member and Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says the president will tell ANC members they are going to focus on internal unity, discipline and self-correction.On Thursday, the NEC met to draw up the final draft of the statement, which will be read by President Jacob Zuma at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday.Gauteng ANC leader Paul Mashatile has warned the ANC can ill-afford to plaster over the gaping cracks within its ranks.Mokonyane says Sunday s speech will show that the ANC is changing course after last year's local election results. We are now self-correcting and reclaiming the base. The second area would be to look at the areas of making sure we turn around the organisation in terms of organisational discipline and culture. While political analyst professor Lesiba Teffo says the party must make sure it does not focus on the past on Sunday. The rhetoric is no longer something you can sell to the people of South Africa. Quasi- revolutionary discourses are no longer relevant to the people of South Africa. Analysts will also be looking through Sunday s statement looking for clues as to the power dynamics within the party ahead of its leadership election in December.(Edited by Neo Koza)
