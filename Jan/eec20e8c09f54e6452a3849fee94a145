JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) Women s League says it doesn't believe that it's been ill-disciplined by publicly saying it wants Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be the next leader of the ANC, and that it won't be persuaded to change its mind.The league said on Saturday night that it had taken a formal decision to lobby ANC members and branches to vote for Dlamini-Zuma during the ANC's elective conference in December.On Sunday morning, ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said that the ANCWL had gone against ANC rules by discussing names of potential leaders before the succession race was formally opened.But the league secretary general Meokgo Matuba says they ve done nothing wrong. We re actually saying that we re not in a position to defy the ANC, however we do have a decision as a structure. She says the league will stick to its decision to push for Dlamini-Zuma, because it s time for the ANC to have its first female leader.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
