The secretary general says it&#8217;s possible there might be what he calls powerful interests seeking to influence the ruling party. JOHANNESBURG As the African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts prepare to meet with the party s top six next week, Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe says it s possible that there might be what he calls powerful interests seeking to influence the party.Mantashe held a round table discussion with journalists at Luthuli House on Wednesday. The stalwarts have raised concerns about the state of the ANC and agreed with the party that a consultative conference must be held to assess the state of the organisation.The secretary-general says this possibility of powerful interests amongst stalwarts doesn t mean that their contribution to the party is meaningless. As veterans and stalwarts meet, there are powerful interests; for example, you find that among them that there are quite significant business people they have interests. So this thing of some holy individuals is actually a myth. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
