Dr Felicity Coughlan says that people should consider private universities as an alternative to public universities. JOHANNESBURG Dr Felicity Coughlan, Director of the Independent Institute of Education, says the lack of space at public universities shouldn t discourage prospective students because there are other options like private universities.Coughlan says that at credible private higher education institutions, one can study anything from professional accounting to business management, communication and law to education. It s important to check the registration accreditation by either asking the institution to show you its registration certificate and if the qualification and address are not on it then it s not registered. Secondly, go to the Department of Higher Education s website and look for the register of private institutions. It s either there or it s not. She says that telling a person who has qualified for degree entry but not gained access to the public sector that they should consider a technical college, does not reflect all the options available.Coughlan adds that it s easy to check how reputable an institution is. South Africa is fortunate that we only have one quality check system, so it s the same committees that decide whether a qualification can be accredited, registered and then offered. Coughlan says that although quality at private higher education institutions vary, just as it does between public universities, matriculants are done a disservice if they are told that their only options are public universities or technical training.
