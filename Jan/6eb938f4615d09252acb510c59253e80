The president has said the ANC will use the Expropriation of Land Act to pursue land reform &amp; land redistribution. JOHANNESBURG Concerns have been raised over government s policies on land redistribution, with some warning that if nothing changes the process of land reform will not be speedily achieved. President Jacob Zuma delivered the party s 8 January statement at the weekend, saying the ANC would use the Expropriation of Land Act to pursue land reform and land redistribution as a matter of urgency.Director of the Land and Accountability Research Centre at the University of Cape Town, Dr. Annika Classens says current policies are flawed. The Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms got the policy that land ownership should not rest in beneficiaries of land reform, they should be perpetual tenants of the state. And you know that s exactly the same policy as South African Development Trust introduced by the 1936 Land Act.
