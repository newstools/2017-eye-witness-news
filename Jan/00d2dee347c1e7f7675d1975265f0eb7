From midnight on Tuesday night motorists will pay 29 cents more for a litre of petrol. CAPE TOWN - From midnight on Tuesday motorists will pay 29 cents more for a litre of petrol, while the price of diesel will increase by 21 cents per litre.The wholesale price of illuminating paraffin will also increase by 17 cents a litre.In 2016, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to cut oil production, placing upward pressure on the price of oil.The Automobile Association s Layton Beard says this is one of the main reasons for this increase. While the rand-US dollar exchange rate stabilised in January, international oil prices are on an upward trajectory. And because of this we re seeing the effect of that in the fuel price that s going up on Tuesday night. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
