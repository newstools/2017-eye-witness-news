Party leader Julius Malema says says those involved in the action have been bought by the State Security Department. JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it doesn't need to join forces with any other political party to take on Absa Bank, warning that when it does happen, it will make international news. The red berets held a briefing at their headquarters in Braamfontein on Monday.Party leader Julius Malema says the EFF will not join the 'Occupy Absa' campaign along with the Black First Land First (BLF) organisation, and says those involved in the action have been bought by the State Security Department. The BLF announced plans to occupy Absa after a leaked report from the Public Protector s office found that the bank benefited from an apartheid-era bailout when it purchased Bankorp.But Malema says the EFF will not join the BLF. It is our programme that Mickey Mouses are trying to hijack. Through money of state security and Gupta s. Can you imagine us marching with those people with the buses paid for by Gupta s? We can t do that. We won t do that. (Edited by Neo Koza)
