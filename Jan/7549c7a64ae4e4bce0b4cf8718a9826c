Former board chairpersons Ben Ngubane &amp; Tshabalala are set to be grilled on a host of issues that took place under their watch. CAPE TOWN Parliament s inquiry into the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board resumes on Friday with testimony from two final witnesses.Former SABC board chairpersons Ben Ngubane and Ellen Tshabalala are set to be grilled on a host of issues that took place under their watch.Last month the committee heard evidence alleging that both played a role in Hlaudi Motsoeneng s rise to power at the public broadcaster.Inquiry chairperson Vincent Smith says both former board chairpersons will face questions on a range of issues. There s a whole host of things that happened under the watch of both Dr Ngubane and Ms Tshabalala and that will be able to help us in our recommendations in terms of how the board should be strengthened, or how the board should operate going forward. The terms of both Ngubane and Tshabalala were not short of controversy. Both have been accused of ensuring that Motsoeneng shot up the corporate ladder at the SABC.Ngubane resigned in 2013 amid allegations by then board members that he improperly tried to overturn a board decision to remove Motsoeneng as acting chief operations officer.Tshabalala resigned in 2014 after Parliament s communications committee found she had misrepresented her qualifications and lied under oath.The hearing gets underway in Parliament at 9am, when Ngubane is expected to be the first in the hot seat.LISTEN: Recap: SABC inquiry wraps up for 2016(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
