The High Court in Johannesburg today explained the reasons behind overturning another court's decision to deny Mcebo Dlamini bail. JOHANNESBURG #FeesMustFall activist Mcebo Dlamini says while the courts did not pronounce on whether charges against him are politically motivated he believes the NPA's meeting at Luthuli House proves they are.The High Court in Johannesburg on Friday explained the reasons behind overturning another court's decision to deny Dlamini bail.Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng says the State used video evidence to argue that Dlamini was a danger to the public but acted improperly by not providing Dlamini the opportunity to view the footage. Although Mr Dlamini alleges that the charges are politically motivated, this judgement says that conclusion can only be reached after this case has been concluded. But Dlamini says his case smacks of interference. The court was very reluctant to pronounce on motive and unjust laws because we don t have an obligation to respect unjust laws. An unjust law should not be respected. If the motive is bad it collapses the rule of law. (Edited by Neo Koza)
