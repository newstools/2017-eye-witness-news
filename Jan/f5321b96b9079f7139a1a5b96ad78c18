The position became available when Shakes Mashaba was dismissed in late December after being found guilty of gross misconduct. CAPE TOWN - EWN Sport understands that the South Africa Football Association's (Safa) recruitment process regarding the vacant Bafana Bafana head coach position is yet to get underway. The position became available after Shakes Mashaba was dismissed in late December following a disciplinary process that found him guilty of gross misconduct. This took place after he was seen to publicly rebuke his bosses following their World Cup qualifying victory over Senegal. However, Safa President Danny Jordaan is in Gabon attending the Afcon and is only expected back sometime next week.His arrival from Gabon might coincide with Mashaba and Safa s appearance at the CCMA on 7 February to contest his dismissal, while Mashaba s legal representative also told EWN Sport they have requested that Safa put on hold their search for a new coach until the matter is resolved.
