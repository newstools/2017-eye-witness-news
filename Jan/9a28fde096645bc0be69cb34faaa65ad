Parents are advised to contact district offices to assist with finding a place at a school if they did not enrol their children at a school last year. CAPE TOWN At least 18, 500 children will not have a seat in a classroom in Western Cape schools when they re-open on Wednesday.Of this number, more than 4,000 are new grade 1 learners, and almost 5,500 of them are learners going to grade 8.Parents are advised to contact district offices to assist with finding a place at a school if they did not enrol their children at a school last year.Western Cape MEC for Education Debbie Schaefer says she s concerned by the high number of unplaced learners. If they come now, without having registered, they stand far less chance of getting a child into a school of choice but the officials will do everything possible to find them a place in a school as conveniently as possible. At the same time, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has assured parents of pupils who applied for the 2017 academic year on time that their children will be placed in a school by Wednesday.Thousands of children are expected back at school this week.About 45,000 pupils in grades 1 and 8 still don t have places in provincial schools.Lesufi says that parents who applied late, may have to wait until the end of next month to place their children. We will try very hard, before the end of February, to place them. If we can t, we will be in a position to communicate with them and indicate to them where we will place them. But those who applied on time, whose details have been captured in our system, we will be in a position to place them. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
