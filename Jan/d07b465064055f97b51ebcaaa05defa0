JOHANNESBURG Limpopo police say they will patrol the Tshitale community in Limpopo on Tuesday night, to prevent further arson attacks on government property.Since Sunday, two schools, a post office and a government building have been burnt down as community members vent their frustrations over service delivery.Demonstrators are demanding the completion of a 45km tar road.Limpopo police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says: Major routes leading to the place have been damaged by protesters. For now, no one has been arrested as yet. Earlier, acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane has confirmed that additional police officers were only deployed to Tshitale after the second school was torched.Phahlane says that when the protest started in the area, police didn t anticipate that schools would be burnt. We didn t anticipate that the situation will reach schools in the area because this is not a school issue. Initially it was about service delivery. Tshitale is situated near Vuwani which was the scene of violent protests over municipal demarcation last year, where 30 schools were either torched or vandalised.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
