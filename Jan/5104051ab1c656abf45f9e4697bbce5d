JOHANNESBURG – Yavi Madurai, the MD of Black Box Theory and social media analyst, says that the #DeadPose  is a bad idea and could have serious consequences. The latest craze is a challenge where people are snapped while pretending to be dead and Madurai says the challenge is a bad idea. “There are people who do it to get that negative response. Social media is a voice of the people and is a free for all. There are no limitations or regulations for things like this.”  The analyst says there are people who have a sick sense of humour. “Unless there has been an actual murder committed that we could report to Facebook or Twitter, there is little we can do. In terms of the hashtag, I don’t believe it will go on for a long time.” She adds that if you see it and it offends you, just scroll up. The latest local internet craze has received a lot of backlash on social media, with some people deeming it to be insensitive.
