I personally called Trevor on his cellphone. I tabled the entire story to him of Reshall Jimmy. I told him about all Ford fire victims. Since December, I have not been able to get through to him. The only service we got from the NCC, which we re so grateful for, was their legal counsel. WATCH: Family of Kuga fire victim unhappy with Ford's responseKaveen Jimmy says that Ford made no attempt to contact his family after his brother Reshall's death. It s only when the death occurred of my brother, did this matter become a bit of out of control for Ford and their first gut instinct was to try and point evidence in any direction but themselves. The Jimmy family maintains that the fire started in the front of the vehicle and not in the rear as Ford has suggested.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
