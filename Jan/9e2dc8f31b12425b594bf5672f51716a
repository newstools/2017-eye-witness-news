JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) is expected to meet with the African Independent Congress (AIC) on Tuesday morning, with the AIC saying it will give the party an ultimatum to either show it s serious about their coalition agreement or lose the only metro it governs in Gauteng.The AIC, which was formed in protest against the demarcation of Matatiele into the Eastern Cape, went into coalition in Ekurhuleni with the ANC after last year s local government elections.It's key demand to the ANC was for the area to be reincorporated back into Kwazulu-Natal.However, meetings with the party have dragged on since August last year.The AIC has sent a stern warning to the ANC, saying if the party fails to reincorporate Matatiele back into KwaZulu-Natal by the end of March this year, it will lose control of the Ekurhuleni metro.AIC President Mandla Galo says they will send a strong message to the party on Tuesday. The strong message that we are going to give them is that we are not going to pass the deadline. He says if the party misses the deadline, it will be sorry. We are pulling out of this collation if the ANC is not delivering on our major demand. The AIC says by delaying and postponing meetings, the ANC has shown it s not serious about the coalition.(Edited by Neo Koza)
