The Higher Education Department is calling on students who are yet to be placed at universities to sign up with the service&#8217;s website so they can be assisted. JOHANNESBURG The Higher Education Department says it has created a safety net called the central application clearing house to help matriculants who have not yet secured university placement.The department s Diane Parker says they are calling on students who are yet to be placed at varsities to sign up with the service s website so they can be assisted.Parker says that the department developed the safety net after a stampede in 2012 that claimed a woman's life at the University of Johannesburg due to the high number of walk-in students. There is a hotline you can phone, a toll free number or you can send an SMS to a number where they will then come back to you or you can go into the website where you can register your information. The key information is your ID number. The department added that it is working on a central application server so matriculants can apply for placement at the universities of their choice from a single platform. It says this long term plan will help end the so called walk-in syndrome&quot;.Parker says that a single system will provide more than one tertiary option for applicants and would also offer career choice advice, among other services. It is the prototype for a much larger system that we are currently in the process of developing; a central application server which in the long run will enable students to apply to a one-stop shop for everything.
