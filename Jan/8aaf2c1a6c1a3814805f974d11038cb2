If they haven t had a solid foundation in terms of quality childhood development programme, then they will struggle throughout their schooling career. And so the root of matric underperformance is actually in the early learning. At the same time, the Social Development Department has opened a counselling line to matriculants who may be anxious about their results, the command centre can be reached on the toll free line, 0800 428 428.To get your 2016 IEB matric results now go to EWN s special matric results page.
