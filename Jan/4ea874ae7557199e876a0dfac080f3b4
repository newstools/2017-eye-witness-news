JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has granted President Jacob Zuma an extension until the end of next month to comment on the provisional report into corruption at Absa.The Presidency received the provisional report from Mkhwebane at the end of December last year.Zuma requested an extension in order to finalise consultations with the relevant players.The President s spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga says: &quot;It pertains to alleged maladministration, corruption, misappropriation of public funds and failure by the South African government to implement CIEX report and recover public funds from Absa.&quot;Absa may be liable to pay back more than R2 billion for an unlawful apartheid-era bailout.Provisionally, Mkhwebane has found that government breached the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act.A previous investigation in 2000 by a central bank-appointed panel found that the loans were made to stabilise the banking system and Absa shareholders did not derive any undue benefit. The panel recommended that no further action be taken.Earlier this month, Barclays Africa said it would cooperate with the Public Protector, but it believed that Mkhwebane's preliminary report had &quot;several factual and legal inaccuracies&quot;.In her suggested remedial action, Mkhwebane proposed that Zuma should consider a commission of inquiry to see whether other apartheid-era loans should be repaid by other institutions.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
