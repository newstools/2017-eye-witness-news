This follows yet another attack on a train driver near the Du Toit Railway Station in Stellenbosch. CAPE TOWN - The United National Transport Union (UNTU) has threatened to take the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) to court over security concerns. This follows yet another attack on a train driver in Cape Town over the weekend.Willem Spence had just passed an informal settlement near the Du Toit Railway Station in Stellenbosch when he saw a man wielding a brick standing on the line ahead of him.The man hurled the brick which shattered the driver's window.Spence sustained injuries to his face and arms.The union's Steve Harris has accused Prasa of not doing enough. These circumstances are getting out of hand and we can t allow or accept Prasa's lack of action. Because at the end of the day Prasa is a state-owned enterprise and government should also intervene.
