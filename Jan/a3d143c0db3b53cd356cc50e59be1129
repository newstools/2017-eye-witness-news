Another pupil said that doing maths and science is important as it will help her to achieve her goals. This is where I do maths and science. It is important to me because I want to be something in this world. Pupils at the school have however not received all their stationery.Limpopo government spokesperson Phuti Seloba says the issue will be attended to. We are making sure as the schools start today we continue to look at areas that did not receive stationery.
