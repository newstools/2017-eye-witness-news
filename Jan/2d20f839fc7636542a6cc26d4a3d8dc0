JOHANNESBURG - The stocks snapped two days of losses and ended the first trading week of 2017 higher, led by market heavyweight Naspers, while gains by the dollar after a US jobs report weakened the rand.The benchmark Top-40 index jumped 1.77% to 44,456 points while the All-share index gained 1.47% to 51,216 points.Naspers, Africa's biggest mobile and e-commerce group, added the most points to the Johannesburg All-Share Index, jumping 4.90% to R2121.50, a six-week high.&quot;Naspers has had a particularly strong day, which is responsible for most of this move today,&quot; said BP Bernstein trader Vasili Tirasis. &quot;Tencent has had a couple of strong trading days and I think Naspers is just following suit there.&quot;Naspers owns a major stake in China's Tencent Holdings.On the foreign exchange market, the rand weakened against the dollar, which gained after US jobs data showed hiring slowed but wages rose. That sets the economy up for more interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve this year.Expectations that US rates will rise tend to weaken demand for emerging-market assets, which offer higher returns but carry more risk.At 15.00 GMT, the rand traded at 13.6600 per dollar, 0.63% weaker from its New York close on Thursday.The dollar index, a measure of the dollar against six world currencies, rose 0.41% to 101.940.Government bonds rose. The yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 dipped 2.5 basis points to 8.835%.
