CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has lost yet another court battle in an attempt to have the City of Cape Town's new branding reviewed.The Supreme Court of Appeal has turned down the party s application for leave to appeal its challenge of the city's logo redesign.The ANC had initially taken the matter to the Western Cape High Court in 2015, claiming that the municipality changed its logo without a proper public participation process. The matter was dismissed by the court.Mayor Patricia de Lille says the city is vindicated: We ve spent a lot of money to defend a decision that we knew was correctly made. The ANC must stop wasting time with the court. There are many urgent matters that the court must deal with. They ve lost the case at the Supreme Court of Appeal again with the cost. The ANC says it will discuss the matter with the party's lawyers.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
