Eskom&#8217;s Matshela Koko says they are reluctant to cut power to the affected municipalities, but they have little choice because of mounting debt. PRETORIA Eskom says consumers who are unhappy with the way their municipalities are run should turn to the courts to hold them accountable. The High Court in Pretoria on Thursday dismissed an application by lobby group AfriForum to stop the power utility from cutting the electricity supply to eight non-paying municipalities. AfriForum argued that residents should not be punished for the failures of their councils.The court found that Eskom was legally entitled to cut the power to a consumer if the bills were not being paid. The power utility s Matshela Koko says that they are reluctant to cut power to the affected municipalities, but they have little choice because of mounting debt. When any of your constitutional rights are infringed upon, you have got recourse to the local court because the municipality has to account. AfriForum s Marcus Pawson says they sympathise with the position Eskom finds itself in. We do sympathise with Eskom, the real culprits are the municipality managers, the municipalities themselves and the councils in the decisions they have taken financially that now the people of South Africa have to bear the brunt of. Eskom will start turning off the lights from Tuesday if the debt is not settled.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
