Gambian election winner Adama Barrow says he'll stay in neighbouring Senegal until his inauguration. PRETORIA - Gambian election winner Adama Barrow says he'll stay in neighbouring Senegal until his inauguration.It looks increasingly unlikely this will take place as scheduled on Thursday.The African Union says it will cease to recognise Yayha Jammeh as President of Gambia after Thursday. However, Jammeh lost the presidential election last month and deplores this.Jammeh has cited irregularities in the polling process and is challenging the election results at Gambia's Supreme Court.But the court could not rule on his challenge this week because judges from Nigeria and Sierra Leone did not show up. The Supreme Court has indicated it may not be able to sit again until May.After a demarche by Jammeh's neighbours failed to move him last week, Nigeria has put 800 troops on standby to deploy if he clings to power.Additional reporting by Reuters.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
