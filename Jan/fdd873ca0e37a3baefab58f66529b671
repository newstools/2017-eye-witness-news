The activist, who has become a local hero to some, has gone on trial for aiding illegal immigrants and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.Cedric Herrou is one of three people to appear before courts in southern France for helping African migrants flee into Europe. His olive farms straddle a valley on the French Italian border near a route used by migrants trying to avoid border controls.Three months ago he and others occupied a nearby disused holiday village and opened it up for a group of migrants.
