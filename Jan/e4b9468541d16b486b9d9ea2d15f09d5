Officials however say there will be no repeat of the NEC&#8217;s last meeting that saw a calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC)'s National Executive Committee (NEC) is due to start discussing what should be in the party's 8 January statement, this morning, in a meeting that could determine some of the party's aims for the year.But officials say there will be no repeat of the NEC s last meeting that saw several cabinet ministers calling for a resolution that President Jacob Zuma should step down.This gathering is due to only discuss the 8 January statement and what the party's plans should be for the year.Traditionally, this leads to the first clues about what the ANC in government will aim to achieve.This may mean there are serious discussions about the economy and how to create more jobs.But some NEC members may also want the party to focus in public in promoting its own unity after the events of 2016.On Wednesday, ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe said the party needed to avoid having what he called accidental leaders and that the ANC needs to groom leaders over the long-term.(Edited by Neo Koza)
