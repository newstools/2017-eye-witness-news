Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has said SA disagrees with Donald Trump&#8217;s order to block entry to the US for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. JOHANNESBURG Some world leaders have spoken out against US president Donald Trump s executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries, with South Africa saying it disagrees with the policy, London calling it shameful and cruel and Canada offering temporary residency to any travellers stranded by the ban.There s been a massive outcry following Trump s implementation of the ban which has seen even refugees who have been previously approved and immigrants with valid visas detained and barred from entering America.Protests are set to continue this week in America this week and a petition to stop his upcoming visit to the UK has gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures.Seattle protest against #MuslimBan.

I think Isis s main recruitment tool is this class of civilisation narrative. The fact that Muslims should not trust in the West, that the West is out to undermine them. This falls square in their benefit. Meanwhile, South Africa s Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has said his government disagrees with Trump s order to block entry to the US for the next three months for people from seven Muslim-majority countries and that blanket bans on particular nationalities are a violation of international law.Gigaba says Trump should be left to do what he believes is good for the United States while the Pretoria government should be allowed to do what it believes is best for South Africa.But, he says, South Africa does not agree with the measures taken by Trump to block refugees from certain countries.The minister says South Africa has an immigration policy based on human rights, humane treatment of people in distress and African solidarity.Gigaba says South Africa would never ban persons from a certain country or because of religious, gender or sexual orientation.He says it violates international law to impose a collective ban on people, except people belonging to an organisation injurious to national interests. MORE NATIONS MAY BE ADDEDWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also said Customs and Border Patrol agents would have &quot;discretionary authority&quot; when they encountered someone arriving who they suspect &quot;is up to no good&quot; from certain nations. Asked why Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Egypt were not included on Trump's list, Priebus said that &quot;perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward.&quot;US judges in at least five states blocked federal authorities from enforcing Trump's directive, but lawyers representing people covered by the order said some authorities were unwilling on Sunday to follow the judges' rulings.US Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, prominent Republican foreign policy voices, said in a joint statement Trump's order may do more to help recruit terrorists than improve US security.&quot;Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,&quot; they said, adding the United States should not stop green card holders &quot;from returning to the country they call home.&quot;&quot;This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,&quot; the added.Trump blasted the two senators in a Twitter statement, calling them &quot;sadly weak on immigration.&quot;In a another Twitter message earlier on Sunday, Trump said the United States needed &quot;strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW.&quot;&quot;Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!&quot; added Trump, who successfully tapped in Americans' fear of attacks during his election campaign.Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!Trump's tweet did not mention that many more Muslims have been killed in the bloody Syrian civil war and other violence in the targeted countries.Condemnation of Trump's action poured in from abroad, including from traditional allies of the United States.In Germany, which has taken in large numbers of people fleeing the Syrian civil war, Chancellor Angela Merkel said the global fight against terrorism was no excuse for the measures and &quot;does not justify putting people of a specific background or faith under general suspicion,&quot; her spokesman said on Sunday.Canada will offer temporary residency to people stranded in the country as a result of Trump's executive order on immigration, Canadian Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said.Briefing reporters at the White House on condition of anonymity, a US administration official rejected criticism of the way Trump's plan had been carried out, saying: &quot;So it really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level.&quot;Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Republican-led US Senate, had a different view, calling Trump's administration incompetent. &quot;One hand doesn't know what the other is doing,&quot; Schumer said.&quot;I think banning refugees, banning immigrants, banning religions like Islam or any other religion, is un-American,&quot; said Will Turner, 42, draped in a US flag among a crowd of several thousand people in front of the White House chanting: &quot;No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here.&quot;An official of the conservative billionaire industrialist Koch brothers' political network of donors criticized Trump's immigration order at the donors' winter gathering in Indian Wells, California.&quot;Our country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies,&quot; Brian Hooks said in a statement.Civil rights and some religious groups, activists and Democratic politicians have promised to fight Trump's order and Schumer said his party would introduce legislation to overturn it. Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate.Priebus said that of 325,000 people who arrived from foreign countries on Saturday, 109 people were detained for further questioning, and most of them were moved out, with just a &quot;couple dozen more that remain&quot; detained.&quot;It wasn't chaos,&quot; he said.Judges in California, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington state, each home to international airports, issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on Saturday night by US District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York's Brooklyn borough in a case involving two Iraqis caught by the order as they flew into the country.Attorneys general from California, New York, 13 other states and Washington, D.C., condemned and pledged to fight what they called Trump's &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;unconstitutional&quot; order.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
