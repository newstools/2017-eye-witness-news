The Townhouse Hotel has placed buckets in each room which they are encouraging guests to place in the shower to allow for water to be recycled . JOHANNESBURG The Townhouse Hotel, in Cape Town, has included buckets in each of its room and is encouraging guests to shower with a bucket.The excess water collected in the bucket is then used to water the garden areas and trees around the hotel.Manager Jacqueline Williams says all 107 rooms now have a bucket and a room card explaining what it is for. Guests are enthusiastic about the programme and we ve even had a few suggestions from them on how to maximise our efforts. This is in a bid to help alleviate the pressure of dropping water levels in Cape Town.The City of Cape Town said earlier on Tuesday that dam levels are effectively sitting at 29%.The municipality has again urged residents to cut their consumption as it prepares to further heighten water restrictions from 1 February.Williams says she hopes the shower buckets will prompt staff to institute similar initiatives at home and in their communities. We are committed to eco-friendly systems and practices, and the shower bucket project is a visible illustration of these values.
