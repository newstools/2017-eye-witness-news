Mayor Herman Mashaba says the reintegration will be a slow process and the best interests of residents will be considered. JOHANNESBURG The City of Joburg says the purpose of reintegrating entities such as City Power, Johannesburg Water and Pikitup back under the city administration is to deal with the service delivery backlog. It says a report of reintegration has been approved by the mayor and will help to streamline services. Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says the reintegration will be a slow process and the best interests of residents will be considered.The city s Tony Taverna-Turisan says there is general consensus that reintegration is the better option. We ve seen it happen in the City of eThekwini and also in the City of Cape Town and it s widely agreed that this is the best way of ensuring that service delivery is enhanced. Turisan says no employees working for the entities will lose their jobs. So employees of these entities should not be concerned as we believe it will help to ensure that they re run effectively. Mashaba says it s time to make bold decisions because his office has inherited government entities that are badly run and inefficient.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
