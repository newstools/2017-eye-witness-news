Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) benefits owing to a person who has died will not be stopped but instead paid to their dependents.Cosatu s Parliamentary spokesperson Matthew Parks: We re very happy with it, it s fantastic. It s going to help workers who are being retrenched, and pregnant mothers, so it s going to mean extra money in their pockets which helps their families at a time of need. But it also means extra money flowing into the economy, which should help spur economic growth down the road. The Unemployment Insurance Amendment Act is one of 10 bills that have been signed into law by President Zuma this week.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
