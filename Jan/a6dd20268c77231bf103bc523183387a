JOHANNESBURG Student activist Mcebo Dlamini says the Fees Must Fall movement will not disrupt the registration process.The High Court in Johannesburg on Friday explained the reasons behind overturning another court's decision to deny Dlamini bail.Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng says the regional courts had an obligation to show Dlamini the video footage evidence used by the state to justify the bail denial and because this was not done, Dlamini s constitutional rights were violated.Dlamini says while he is in high spirits and pleased with the judgment, he cannot celebrate until fellow protesting students who are still incarcerated are set free. We can t just protest for the sake of protesting. We can t protest and it becomes a ritual. We must protest because there is a reason or need to protest. In this case government has closed quite a number of loopholes. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
