VUWANI - The Limpopo group that led violent protests in Vuwani says it will allow schooling to go ahead in the town, but only if government works toward a municipal demarcation solution.The Pro-Makhado Task Team says it wants peace in the area, but it s also demanding that government step in and halt the demarcation board's decision to incorporate Vuwani into a new municipality.More than 20 schools were either torched or vandalised in the Limpopo town last year.The residents' task team, along with government, has visited five schools since Wednesday morning where they've motivated pupils to aim for high mark s at the end of the year.The team says it is completely behind schooling, but will not compromise on its stance that Vuwani remain separate from a new municipality.The team's Nsovo Sambo says: Our hope is for this process to find a proper and lasting solution. Minister of International Relations Maite Nkoana Mashabane and the local Co-Operative Department say they are happy with the performance of Vuwani's class of 2016 and are calling on this year's matrics to set the bar even higher.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
