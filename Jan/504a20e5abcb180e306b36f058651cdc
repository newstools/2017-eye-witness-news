Tshwane Metro Police Constable Takatso Mashego&#8217;s attorney says he will plead not guilty to Tsakani Shimange&#8217;s murder. PRETORIA The attorney for a Tshwane Metro Police officer accused of murder says his client will plead not guilty to the charge. Thirty-eight-year-old Tsakani Shimange died from a single gunshot wound to the chest shortly after he was stopped by Constable Takatso Mashego near the Gautrain station in Hatfield last week. Mashego made a brief appearance in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Monday, where the matter was postponed to Friday for a formal bail application.Attorney Peter Jay says his client, the constable will, challenge the State on the murder charge and plead not guilty. We will deny the fact that he was not provoked. There definitely was a lot of provocation. He was bumped by the deceased s vehicle twice, has not received any medical treatment. Jay has also suggested that his client feared for his life following the shooting incident.&quot;On Saturday, he was extremely afraid to request any medical treatment because he was afraid that he would be taken to Pretoria Central, where there are people that know him. And we'd like to bring a bail application as soon as possible and we've already [been] this morning to bring a bail application but unfortunately the State has an objection to bail.&quot;Eyewitness News understands police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate has seized surveillance footage of the incident which appears to show that the shooting was unprovoked. Tshwane Metro Police management has committed to co-operating with investigators on the incident.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
