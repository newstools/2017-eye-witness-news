A Kyoto midwife thought replicating how children are swaddled at birth could help mothers overcome post labour shoulder and hip pain. TOKYO Wrapped up from head to toe in a white bag and gently rocking from side to side, five Japanese mothers are hopeful Tokyo's latest health trend can cure their post-pregnancy aches and pains.According to its exponents, Otonamaki, which translates as &quot;adult wrapping&quot;, was devised by a Kyoto midwife who thought replicating how children are swaddled at birth could help mothers overcome post labour shoulder and hip pain.The five mothers at a recent session in Tokyo lay on their backs with their knees on their chests bundled up in white cloths. Staff then helped them rock over cushions.&quot;It felt warm and there was this feeling with my body,&quot; said one mother who tried the 20 minute session. &quot;I have never experienced this before so it s quite hard to describe properly.&quot;Not everyone is a fan. Chiropractor Shiro Oba was skeptical about its powers of healing and encouraged mothers with back pain to visit a physician.&quot;There may be cases where people with asthma may find it easier to breath (in that position), but once the cloth is off it's the same thing,&quot; said Oba.&quot;But apart from that, I just can't think of how people can benefit from this even as a form of reflexology or exercise.&quot;
