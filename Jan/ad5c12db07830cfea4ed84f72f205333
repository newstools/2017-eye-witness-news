Now the party says all nominations for leadership from branches will be consolidated nationally by the IEC. JOHANNESBURG As the African National Congress (ANC) prepares for its elective conference later this year, the party has introduced a new way of nominating leaders for positions, with the hope that it will stop slate politics.The party's secretary-general, Gwede Mantashe, announced the national executive committee (NEC) resolved to do away with the practice of consolidating nominations for leadership at a regional and provincial level.Mantashe briefed the media earlier on Monday, following the NEC lekgotla.Previously ANC branches would nominate its candidates for leadership, send the list to the party's regional structure and then to the provincial structure for consolidation.The secretary-general says that process tampers with the authority of branches to nominate as the basic unit of the party. We need to do something that will ensure that branches are given the right to nominate. In other words, when we nominate in the branches we seal those envelopes and take them to a central point, nationally. Now all nominations for leadership from branches will be consolidated nationally by the electoral commission.The ANC's leadership has been struggling to contain discussions around who will succeed President Jacob Zuma as head of the party.ANC Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, outgoing African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, long-serving cabinet minister Jeff Radebe and National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete have been named as possible candidates to stand for the party's presidential position.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
