The primary school in Tshitale, along with a post office and government building, were torched in a service delivery protest at the weekend. JOHANNESBURG - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says she s deeply disappointed after yet another school was burned down in Limpopo. The primary school in Tshitale near Vuwani, along with a post office and government building, were torched in a service delivery protest at the weekend. Last year, at least 30 schools were either torched or vandalised in demonstrations over municipal demarcation in the area. The minister says that she battles to understand why residents express their frustration through the burning of schools. Just when we thought things were settling, they burn another school. I think it was the worst thing they could have done after last year. I thought they had learned their lesson. She says the Tshitale community should have known better.Motshekga, together with her counterpart in Transport Minister Dipuo Peters launched a &quot;safer schools&quot; campaign at Soshanguve East Secondary School on Tuesday.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
