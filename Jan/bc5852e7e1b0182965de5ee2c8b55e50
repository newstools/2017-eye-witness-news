The ANC's Gwede Mantashe says that if the North West ANC wants Brian Molefe to be on the list, it won&#8217;t happen overnight. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says the name of former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is not on the party s list for Parliament.The Sunday Times reported on Sunday that the ANC in the North West wants to put Molefe on its Parliamentary list so that he would ultimately become the new Finance Minister when President Jacob Zuma reshuffles his cabinet.Mantashe says there is already a list of Parliamentarians registered with the IEC that can t be amended before those Parliamentarians finish 12 months in the National Assembly and he says Molefe is not on that list, just yet. Mantashe says if the North West ANC wants him to be on the list, it won t happen overnight. We don t wake up one day, put Brian Molefe on the list to Parliament and he goes to Parliament. It doesn t happen that way. He says there are processes to follow. There should be two things that happen; they should wait for the anniversary of the amendment and at that point, it can reprioritise its list. If it prioritises Brian, then he will be the first to replace whoever is out of Parliament when there s a vacancy. Mantashe says another way would be to wait for the list of Parliamentarians to be depleted and then include Molefe s name when the list is replenished.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
