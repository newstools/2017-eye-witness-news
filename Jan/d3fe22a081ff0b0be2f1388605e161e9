Entities such as City Power, Joburg Water and Pikitup back into the City in what it is says is a bid to improve service delivery. JOHANNESBURG The City of Johannesburg this week approved a report proposing the process to integrate municipal owned entities such as City Power, Joburg Water and Pikitup back into the City. The City says this has been done as a new approach in improving service delivery in Johannesburg. Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba says service delivery has been too slow and residents have made this clear when they voted for change in last year s local elections. Mashaba says it's time to make bold decisions because his office has inherited government entities which have been badly run and inefficient.Mayoral spokesperson Tony Turisan says, The mayor has stated how ridiculous it is how these entities, which are at the centre of service delivery in our city, are often controlled independently by boards and this can have an impact on service delivery.
