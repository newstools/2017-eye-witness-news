Donald Trump told ABC News that while US taxpayers would have to initially fund the wall, Mexico would ultimately pay for it. WASHINGTON United States (US) President Donald Trump said he expects construction of a US-Mexico border wall to start within months and that planning is already underway, according to excerpts of an interview with ABC News released on Wednesday.He told the television network that while US taxpayers would have to initially fund the wall, Mexico would ultimately pay for it, adding that negotiations for the reimbursement would start &quot;relatively soon.&quot;President Trump on Wednesday signed directives to build a wall along the US border with Mexico and crack down on US cities that shield illegal immigrants, proceeding quickly on sweeping and divisive plans to curb immigration and boost national security.The Republican president is also expected to take steps in the coming days to limit legal immigration, including executive orders restricting refugees and blocking the issuing of visas to people from several Muslim-majority Middle Eastern and North African countries including Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen.Trump signed two executive orders during an appearance at the Department of Homeland Security, one on building a wall along the roughly 3,200km US-Mexico border and the other to strip federal grant money from &quot;sanctuary&quot; states and cities, often governed by Democrats, that harbour illegal immigrants.In cities such as San Francisco local officials, often Democrats, refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on actions against illegal immigrants.&quot;The American people are no longer going to have to be forced to subsidize this disregard for our laws,&quot; White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.
