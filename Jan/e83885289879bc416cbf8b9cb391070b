Parliament's Communications Portfolio Committee chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana says appointing an interim SABC board is now urgent. CAPE TOWN - Parliament will take the first steps towards appointing an interim board for the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) later this month.The board ceased to exist after its chairperson Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe resigned last month.Maguvhe quit soon after he was grilled by a Parliamentary inquiry into the board.That inquiry resumes on Friday, when former board chairpersons Ellen Tshabalala and Dr Ben Ngubane are set to testify.Communications Portfolio Committee chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana says appointing an interim SABC board is now urgent.&quot;We are starting the process on 24 January in our meeting, not necessarily having the names but outlining what the process will be.&quot;The committee must decide on five names for an interim board, each of whom will serve for six months.The names must first be endorsed by the National Assembly before being submitted to President Jacob Zuma, who makes the appointments.Meanwhile, the contracts of the acting group chief executive and chief financial officer expire at the end of January.Given Parliament's programme, this could leave the SABC without any executive authority until well into February.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
