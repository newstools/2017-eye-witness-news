LONDON - A British environmentalist has been forced to tear down solar panels from his barn because it spoils the view from his own farmhouse.The house is next door to the barn. But while the farm building is quite ramshackle, the house is protected by legislation to safeguard its future because it's deemed to be of historical interest.The 66-year-old owner was wanting to make the property as environmentally-friendly and low-carbon as possible.He installed a number of solar panels to his barn s roof without permission. While it is his farmhouse and not his barn that s of architectural interest, the whole site falls under the protection order.After a two-year battle and appeal, the environmentalist was told to rip out his eco-friendly roofing from his home in South Wales.He claims his electricity bill will increase by more than R9,000 per year.
