JOHANNESBURG - Teacher union Sadtu is warning of a looming crisis in the education sector in Limpopo.Some pupils have been left without educators after a number of temporary maths and science teachers' contracts were not renewed.Most of those affected are believed to be foreign nationals.The province saw a decline in the 2016 national senior certificate exams from a 71% pass rate to 68%.Sadtu's provincial deputy secretary Sowell Tjebane says: Our main worry and concern is that it will affect teaching and learning quiet negatively because it is not the only problem that we have now. Meanwhile the Limpopo Education Department's Naledzani Rasila says there may be a number of factors that led to the non-renewal of contracts. A contract cannot be renewed when there are reasons for doing that, for example foreign teachers have got to qualify to be in the country. (Edited by Neo Koza)
