Theresa May invited the new Donald Trump on a state visit to the UK which would likely include a meeting with the queen. LONDON - British Prime Minister Theresa May appears to be standing by the invitation she extended to Donald Trump during her recent visit to the White House despite a petition against this. May invited the new US president on a state visit to the UK which would likely include a meeting with the queen. Trump s executive order banning refugees and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries has sparked outrage in Britain and across the globe.Politicians are breaking party lines and activists are getting their placards ready, but 10 Downing Street doesn t appear to be reconsidering its position on Trump s state visit. In less than 24 hours, over a million people have signed a petition for the visit to be cancelled, given Trump s record of misogyny and vulgarity. Protests are planned for this evening and senior politicians are calling for an urgent parliamentary debate on Trump s ban. But May s office is being quoted as saying she is still &quot;looking forward&quot; to hosting trump later this year. Trump, meanwhile, continues to defend his controversial decision.
