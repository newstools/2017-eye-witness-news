JOHANNESBURG The Home Affairs Department says more than 33,000 people were deported from South Africa in the 2015-2016 financial year, adding that the number would be higher but the ministry has constraints due to a lack of resources.Malusi Gigaba gave an update in Pretoria on Sunday on his department's work as well as the process for special permits for Lesotho nationals.The minister emphasised the important role migrants play in South Africa s economy but added that his department has a duty to protect the country s borders and ensure they stay in the country legally.Gigaba says that his department is under-resourced and this affect the daily duties of the ministry. A total of 33,339 persons were deported during 2015-2016 financial year. Due to budgetary constraints, this number was lower than expected. And these, I must emphasise, resources levels are below what is required in order for us to carry out our national mandate. The minister says that the number of asylum seekers received from January to December 2015 was 62,159. Of this, 2,499 were recognised as refugees.GOVT STANDS TO BENEFITGigaba says government does not aim to hinder migration to South Africa, but has urged business to ensure that 60% of its staff are South African.He says migration is a natural phenomenon which he welcomes but adds that business may trigger tensions in communities when they overlook competent South Africans for jobs. Business visas carry the condition that 60% of the business staff compliment must be South African, and yet many citizens and labour stakeholders and sister departments are concerned that many businesses do not want to hire South African workers. Minister Gigaba says this perception has led to the belief that many businesses exploit migrant workers to lower wages and conditions.He says the department will meet with business to discuss this and ensure inspections of businesses that may not be adhering to the 60% policy.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
