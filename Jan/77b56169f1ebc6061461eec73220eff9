President Jacob Zuma will deliver the statement at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Sunday. JOHANNESBURG - As African National Congress (ANC) President Jacob Zuma puts the final touches to his last January 8 statement, there's still no certainty as to whether the national executive committee has decided to publicly acknowledge the problems facing the party.On Thursday, Gauteng ANC leader Paul Mashatile said there was apparent denialism. This comes after ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said the ANC had to deal with corruption within its ranks.Unisa professor Lesiba Teffo says he would advise the ANC to stay away from focusing on the past on Sunday, when Zuma delivers the statement at the Orlando Stadium. The rhetoric is no longer something you can sell to the people of South Africa. Revolutionary discourses are no longer important to the people. Political analyst Sipho Seepe says the party can't make any major new announcements because of structural issues. The ANC will continue to manage the deepening conditions within itself. It may have to come to a stage where certain groupings will have to leave. The address could also offer clues as to the power dynamics within the party, ahead of its leadership election in December.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
