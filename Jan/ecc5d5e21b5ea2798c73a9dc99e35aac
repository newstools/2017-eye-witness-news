Phiyega instructed her legal team to challenge the Claassen Commission of Inquiry&#8217;s final report, which found that she was unfit to hold office. JOHANNESBURG Suspended National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega s legal representatives say they are ready to argue their case in court and are now waiting for a response to their application.Last week, Phiyega instructed her legal team to challenge the Claassen Commission of Inquiry s final report which found that she was unfit to hold office.She argues that the commission led by retired judge Neels Claassen had no right to re-formulate charges against her but instead should have proved the charges brought by her employer.Phiyega s legal representative Sandile July says they have studied the Claassen Inquiry s final report and are now of the view that they have a case to argue in court.July says they have made an application at the High Court in Pretoria to have the report set aside and will now wait for a response. In fact, we re waiting for the response which may not happen necessarily now. He says the inquiry is in total contradiction to the Farlam Inquiry into the Marikana massacre and has the finding that Phiyega is unfit to hold office without any concrete evidence, one that they re now challenging.July insists that it was not the decision of Phiyega to use tactical force to end the struggle in Marikana in 2012, but that of the then North West Police Commissioner Zukiswa Mbombo.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
