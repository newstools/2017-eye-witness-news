Dikgang Moseneke says the country's 1994 deal didn&#8217;t include historic economic variances which had existed since 1652. JOHANNESBURG Retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke says the country's 1994 deal for freedom and democracy for all its people did not include historic economic variances which had existed since 1652.Moseneke was speaking alongside retired judge Albie Sachs about various topics which affect the judicial system.The event in Johannesburg, hosted by the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, was also dedicated to the life of late ANC president Oliver Tambo.Moseneke says it is false to say that Nelson Mandela was a 'sell-out'.The retired judge says a historic fact is that 1994 was a negotiation and admits there was no economic transformation. It will have to be dealt with and it lives side-by-side with growing the economy and finding more equalisation. Sachs says during the compilation of the Constitution they did not outline how to develop the economy. The Constitution needs building by the new people in power and to transform economically. Sachs says the constitution is a foundation for the country to build on.
