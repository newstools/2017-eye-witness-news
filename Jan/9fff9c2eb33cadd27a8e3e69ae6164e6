CAPE TOWN - Fire crews in Grabouw have been forced to stand down due to poor visibility.Overberg fire department chief Reinhard Geldenhys says that the low cloud cover and strong winds remain a concern.The blaze reignited on Tuesday following an arson attack last week.Geldenhys adds additional teams are on standby to assist with rations on Friday. We ve got very low clouds on the mountain and the wind is very strong which makes it unsafe for ground forces to be deployed into the mountain. It s very frustrating because we know there s a fire burning and we can t get to it due to weather conditions. We have teams on standby waiting for it to lift on foot or by aircraft. At the same time firefighters are still monitoring the runaway veld fire in the Helderberg basin.Helicopters were redeployed to the region on Friday following overnight flare ups.GALLERY: Western Cape firefighting efforts and the aftermath#HelderbergFire - A few exhausted members take a break outside Grabouw IC, after spending the night on the fireline on Wednesday. pic.twitter.com/IImvjdkElx(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
