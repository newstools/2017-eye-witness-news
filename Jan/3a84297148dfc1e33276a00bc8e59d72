The Finance Minister says the claim by the Gupta family that he asked business leaders to clip their wings is not backed up. JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan says the claim by the Gupta family that he told business leaders to clip their wings is a conspiracy and a latter-day fabrication.He s now lodged his court papers in response to the Guptas claims about him as part of his application asking a judge to order that he does not have the legal power to force the banks to keep the family s firm accounts open.His application has also revealed that the Financial Intelligence Centre flagged R6.8 billion worth of transactions through Gupta accounts as suspicious.In his legal papers Gordhan refers several times to the Public Protector s state capture report, which suggests the Gupta family may have had the political power to influence Cabinet appointments.He says the claim by the family that he asked business leaders to clip their wings is not backed up and that they have not revealed who the source of this claim is, how many sources they are and how the Gupta family came to hear of it.Gordhan also disagrees with the Guptas claim that because the Hawks are not investigating these suspicious transactions, there can be no case against them.He says the Financial Intelligence Centre has not yet finished its report and that he can personally attest to the fact that the Hawks appear to have other priorities.That comment may be a reference to the investigation by the Hawks that led to the decision by the National Prosecuting Authority to charge him, before the charge was later withdrawn. In these documents Gordhan further says the Oakbay companies haven't actually responded properly to his arguments and that Oakbay has actually behaved unreasonably in this case.He also says strongly denies the Gupta's claims that he asked business leaders to clip their wings, and say that they have not shown how they could possibly have said this.Gordhan says it doesn't make sense for the Guptas to first ask for his help in dealing with the banks, and to now claim that he was responsible for their decision to stop doing business with their companies.He also says they have claimed that there is a long and unfortunate political history between himself and the family, but that in the letters they wrote to him, there is no mention of this history.The minister also says the Guptas have used this court case to, as he says, &quot;make allegations against me which not even the new age could credibly disseminate&quot;.
