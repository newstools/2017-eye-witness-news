The 14-time grand slam champion, seeded fifth on his return from a wrist injury that forced him to end his 2016 season in October. BRISBANE Former world number one Rafa Nadal bulldozed Mischa Zverev 6-1, 6-1 in the Brisbane International on Thursday to set up a mouth-watering quarter-final clash with defending champion and top seed Milos Raonic.The 14-time grand slam champion, seeded fifth on his return from a wrist injury that forced him to end his 2016 season in October, took 55 minutes to sweep aside his German opponent in a one-sided contest between two left-handers. It's going to be a tough match, Nadal said of his match against Raonic. His serve is huge so I will need to return aggressively. Raonic began his title defence with a 6-3, 6-2 win against Argentine Diego Schwartzman.Better known for his groundstrokes, the Canadian came to the net 22 times, suggesting serve-volley specialist and former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek - who Raonic added to his coaching team last month - is already exerting an influence.But he lost 10 of those points, a rate of return he will want to improve on. I probably should have approached (the net) 12 more times and I probably should have won a few more, said the world number three. ...I hesitated, but also, with him, you ve got to understand that he s quite quick. So rarely do you get him sort of reaching for balls, added Raonic, who smashed 12 aces and won 75% of his first-service points.Former finalist Grigor Dimitrov beat French veteran Nicolas Mahut 6-2, 6-4 to set up a quarter-final clash with Austria's Dominic Thiem who beat Australian wildcard Sam Groth 7-6(5), 6-3.
