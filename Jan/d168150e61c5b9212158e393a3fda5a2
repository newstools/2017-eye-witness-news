This follows reports Eskom has done nothing about findings of a probe which allegedly recommended steps to strengthen governance. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom is adamant that a report by multi-national law firm Denton found no new issues during an inquiry into the state of the business two years ago.This follows reports the power utility has done nothing about the findings of the probe which allegedly recommended steps that needed to be taken to strengthen governance at the parastatal.It s also believed that Denton named key people behind the failures at the power utility and its financial fragility; some of whom are said to be on the current Eskom board.The parastatal says it developed an implementation plan which was fully completed last November.Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said, It was an investigation commissioned by Eskom itself in terms of improving its financial and operational performances. Unlike commissions of inquiry which are about the public and you have to come back and report what is going on, this was meant to be Eskom management and the board on what has gone wrong.
