The comments were a direct response to remarks by Donald Trump to an interview in which he said the &quot;One China&quot; policy was negotiable. BEIJING China's foreign ministry said on Saturday that its &quot;One China&quot; principle was the non-negotiable political basis for China-US relations, and urged &quot;relevant parties&quot; in the United States to recognise the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue.The comments, posted on the foreign ministry's website, were a direct response to remarks by United States (US) President-elect Donald Trump in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in which he said the &quot;One China&quot; policy was negotiable.Since 1979, the US has acknowledged Taiwan as part of &quot;one China&quot;, but Trump prompted a diplomatic protest from Beijing by accepting a congratulatory phone call on his election win from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan on 2 December.
