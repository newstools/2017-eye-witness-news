MK pic.twitter.com/jWKrU1yvhL We must ask her how far are you with taking the DA to court because they said you re a spy. If you re not a spy, because now we believe you re a spy, your actions suggest that you re a spy, so take the DA to court [if you re not a spy]. He says the EFF is working on a plan to have her removed but didn t give details. It s bad, I tell you now but I can guarantee you, that we will solve this problem. We are just waiting for one or two things and once they land on our hands, that s it. Malema says he will reveal more information once he has the confirmation he needs.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
