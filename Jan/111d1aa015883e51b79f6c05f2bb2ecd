While average consumption has dropped over the past two weeks, it&#8217;s still 29 million litres above the desired level. CAPE TOWN The City of Cape Town is threatening a blanket ban on the watering of gardens unless residents reduce their water usage even further. While average consumption has dropped over the past two weeks, it s still 29 million litres above the desired level. Dam levels are now standing at only 46%, while water usage is exceeding 800 million litres a day. City spokeswoman Priya Reddy says, We know that there are still a number of dry months ahead. So unless residents reduce their water use to meet the target, even more stringent restrictions are likely in the near future.
