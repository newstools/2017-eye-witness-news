JOHANNESBURG - The State has revealed in court that terror arrests made in the UK in November last year led to evidence which further implicates the Thulsie twins in terror activities. Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie, who have been in custody since July, appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrates Court on Tuesday. The Hawks arrested the 23-year-old twins on suspicion that they had been plotting terrorist attacks against a US mission in Johannesburg as well as Jewish cultural sites. Police investigator Wynand Olivier states in an affidavit that he and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) were contacted by British authorities in November and informed of fresh evidence against Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie.He says that in December he met with two British detectives who travelled to South Africa to discuss the relevance of the evidence.Oliver says the NPA is now in the process of finalising mutual legal assistance agreements in order to use the information against the pair.He says similar agreements are being sought with six other countries, including France and America. The matter has been postponed until Friday to allow the defence to prepare to oppose the State s request for a three month postponement for further investigations.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
