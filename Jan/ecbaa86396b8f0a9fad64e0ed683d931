JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) leader Paul Mashatile says there appears to be denialism and a lack of courage to deal with the crisis that is confronting the ANC. He has written article in the Sowetan newspaper in which he also says that the party needs to take unprecedented action to resolve its problems. This comes as the ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) is currently meeting to discuss what should be in its 8 January statement, when it is made public on Sunday.Mashatile says that the ANC needs to take decisive steps and unprecedented action leading up to and going beyond the National Consultative Conference, planned as part of the national policy conference later this year.He also says the apparent denialism and lack of courage have plunged the ANC into a deeper morass.Mashatile says the ANC can ill afford to plaster over the gaping cracks within its ranks.The Gauteng ANC leaders previously being highly critical of President Jacob Zuma s leadership of the party, saying he should reconsider his position as president.Earlier this week, ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said if the party did not find ways to stop corruption, it would be in serious trouble with voters.Meanwhile, Water and Sanitation Minister and member of the ANC's NEC Nomvula Mokonyane says the NEC has moved on from its discussions last year about whether President Zuma should step down from the presidency. Mokonyane says the party has a rich history of tolerating different views.She says this is a very different meeting to the one that was held last year. We ve moved past the issues that were raised during the NEC last year. Every member of the NEC who s here is the same member who was present at the same time last year, so the mood is quiet exciting.
