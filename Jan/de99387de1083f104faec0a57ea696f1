JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department says, with plans to build a school every month, it s cautiously optimistic about the prospect of a smooth placement process next year. The department says while it was initially focused on building schools for communities that have none, the fast growth of suburban development has presented problems. The department is currently under stress as over 35,000 unplaced learners still need to be accommodated.Spokesperson for Basic Education MEC in Gauteng Oupa Bodibe says that the reason parents who applied online and on time last year have not found placement yet is because they stay in highly populated areas with little schools.He says the department has been building at least 13 schools annually since 2013 because it realised that pressure was building. Eight new brick and mortar schools and 12 new ACT schools, which means not brick and mortar, have been opened this year, so adding 603 classrooms, 314 Grade R classrooms. Bodibe says the department also aims to refurbish five old public schools and reintroduce them as schools for children with autism.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
