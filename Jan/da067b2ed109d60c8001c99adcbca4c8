The price of petrol has increased by between 48 cents and 50 cents per litre. JOHANNESBURG - Our new year's cheer may be somewhat dampened after the fuel price went up.The price of petrol has increased by between 48 cents and 50 cents per litre.The cost of diesel has also been hiked by between 37 cents and 39 cents a litre.Economist Mike Schussler says this will have a knock-on effect. When the price of petrol and diesel goes up it also impacts transport prices. Very often transport costs mean other prices, such as food, go up as well. I think South Africans will be affected mainly by transport costs. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
