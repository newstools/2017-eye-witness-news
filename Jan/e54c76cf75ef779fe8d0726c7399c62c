Rosatom has been considered as the leading candidate for a tender to build 9.6 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity in SA by 2030. JOHANNESBURG Eskom has rejected reports which claim that the Russian state nuclear agency Rosatom has submitted its bid for building a nuclear power project in South Africa.The state power company says this is not the first time such reports have been circulated, and that it has been dispelling them for the past two years.According to news agency Tass, Rosatom submitted a bid for a nuclear power project in South Africa. The company's general director Alexei Likhachev made the announcement on Tuesday.Eskom s Khulu Phasiwe says the utility is nowhere near the phase at which companies are invited to submit their bids. We have not received any bids from anyone, and the reason for that is that we have not issued out a requests for proposals yet. What Eskom has issued is a request for information. We don t know where these reports are coming from that suggest that Rosatom has submitted a bid to Eskom. Rosatom has been considered the leading candidate for a tender to build 9.6 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity in South Africa by 2030.However, nuclear agency the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation said last year that it was no longer &quot;the front runner&quot;.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
