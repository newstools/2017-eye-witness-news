It's also emerged the acting police commissioner will serve papers on several parties to stop an investigation into his conduct. PRETORIA - Eyewitness News can reveal that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has expanded its investigation into Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane.Ipid is now trying to establish how he bought and financed at least six cars over the last three years.It has also emerged that the top cop will on Wednesday serve papers on several parties to stop the investigation into his conduct. Just a week ago, Ipid investigators searched Phahlane s house and seized an R80,000 home theatre system as part of a corruption investigation. A Land Rover Discovery, Range Rover Sport, VW Amarok and Toyota Hilux are among the cars registered to the acting national police commissioner, and Ipid wants to know how he paid for them. EWN has also seen an affidavit from a car dealer in the North of Pretoria, who claims he bought the Hilux bakkie and gave it to Phahlane to use in community projects. In the statement the car dealer, whose name is known to EWN, says that the lieutenant-general accepted the offer and it was agreed he would have use of the vehicle for 18 months. The man insists he gained no benefit from the deal but he had hoped to go into business with Phahlane in the future. In response to EWN s questions, Phahlane s spokesperson Sally de Beer says this information has been unlawfully leaked in an attempt to defame and humiliate Phahlane. She says, All will be revealed in upcoming court proceedings.&quot; Ipid s Moses Dlamini has declined to comment, saying the matter relates to an ongoing investigation.(Edited by Neo Koza)
