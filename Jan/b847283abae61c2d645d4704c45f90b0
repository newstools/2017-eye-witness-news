The Tshwane Metro Police Department says it will assist in the investigation into the shooting of a motorist in Hatfield by one of its officers. PRETORIA The Tshwane Metro Police Department says it remains committed to working with police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) in a murder case involving one of its officers. Constable Takatso Mashego made a brief appearance in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Monday where the matter was postponed until Friday for a formal bail application. Thirty-eight-year-old Tsakani Shimange was shot and killed last week shortly after being stopped by the constable near the Hatfield Gautrain station in. The Tshwane Metro police s Isaac Mahamba, who attended court proceedings on Monday, says they will assist Ipid investigators if needed. The investigation internally is still happening, but as a department we want to allow the Ipid space to continue with this particular investigation and we have pledged our cooperation to the Ipid and we will continue to support them all the way. Constable Mashego s defence attorney says his client will plead not guilty to the charge of murder. It is alleged Shimange bumped his car into the constable s legs, injuring him prior to the shooting.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
