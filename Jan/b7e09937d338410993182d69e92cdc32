JOHANNESBURG The Palestinian Embassy in South Africa has denied claims that Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane had planned a trip to Palestine while visiting Israel saying it only became aware of his visit to the region through the media.Last week, Maimane visited Israel and posed for a picture with the country s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The DA says Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas was scheduled to meet with Maimane but cancelled at the last minute, a claim the embassy denies.First secretary of the Palestinian embassy in South Africa Hassan Aldrani said: We didn t receive any requests from the DA to meet with Palestinian official. African National Congress spokesperson Khusela Sangoni has described the party as hypocritical. The ANC finds it hypocritical that the DA would try to justify their trip to Israel by lying about the fact that they had a meeting planned with the president. The DA has been unavailable for comment but the party has tweeted that the meeting was confirmed with the president of the Palestinian authority and says it will release records proving this.
