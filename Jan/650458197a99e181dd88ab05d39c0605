The university says it s in talks with the current student leadership to find solutions to some concerns raised.Last year the institution shut its doors for over two weeks due to fees related protests.The university management says although it is aware of the prospect of protests at campuses, it is satisfied with its ongoing talks with student leaders.Spokesperson Willa de Ruyter says, There has been lots of engagement with the elected student leaders and the university has always been committed in meeting the student leaders and to talk about resolving issues before they turn into trouble. She says security has been heightened as some students will be sitting for their supplementary exams. As far as the examinations are concerned, students will once again be escorted to the various exams venues. De Ruyter says the university will be accepting late applications, however, they must be submitted online as no walk ins will be accepted.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
