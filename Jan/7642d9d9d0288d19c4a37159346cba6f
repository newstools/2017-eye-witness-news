INFIGHTING NEEDS TO STOPZuma says the people have told the party the in-fighting needs to stop and they need to grow the economy.Zuma says the ANC has received a clear message. Our people have told us that we come across as too busy fighting one another and do not pay sufficient attention to their needs.
