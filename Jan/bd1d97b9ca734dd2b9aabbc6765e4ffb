Mokonyane says the January 8 statement will show people that the ruling party has listened to internal &amp; public concerns. JOHANNESBURG - Water and Sanitation Minister and ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) member, Nomvula Mokonyane says the party's January 8 statement will show that the ANC is self-correcting and focusing on issues of unity.President Jacob Zuma will deliver his final anniversary statement at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday as the ANC marks 105 years.During the NEC's last meeting late last year several members tried to bring a resolution to remove Zuma from the presidency.Mokonyane says the set-piece speech on Sunday will show people that the ANC has listened to their concerns. It will reflect on the area of the state of the organisation, emphasising unity in action; responding and accepting that we have listened to our people. We have heard them. But political analyst professor Sipho Seepe says the ANC's situation is the result of structure. The ANC will continue to have to manage the deepening contradictions within itself, and it may have to come to a stage where it may have to let certain groupings leave. Earlier this week ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said the ANC had to deal with corruption, factionalism and leadership, otherwise it would be in serious trouble with the voters.(Edited by Neo Koza)
