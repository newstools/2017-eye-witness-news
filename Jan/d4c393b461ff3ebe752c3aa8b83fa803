Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has encouraged schools, including Ho&#235;rskool Overkruin, to accommodate as many children as possible. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has told parents at the Ho rskool Overkruin that he won't allow the privileged to prevent any other child from getting the same education.The Pretoria school along with Ho rskool Montana took the department to court this week in a bid to stop the placement of additional English pupils in their classrooms, arguing that their resources had been overstretched.Lesufi says that no child will be chased away and although resources are scarce, schools should strive towards finding solutions.He has encouraged schools to share resources to accommodate as many children as possible in the wake of placement challenges in the province. Reality is that we don t have enough facilities but let s share because all these children belong to all South Africa. While it s not clear whether Ho rskool Montana and Ho rskool Overkruin will return to court after their urgent interdict application was thrown out, Lesufi says there is no space in Gauteng for anyone unwilling to share school resources. Anyone who wants to use privileges and other threats to say it is only their privileged few that must have these privileges, they are wrong. Not in this province. Lesufi says he has given his department until the end of this month to sort out placing learners at the two schools in question.(Edited by Neo Koza)
