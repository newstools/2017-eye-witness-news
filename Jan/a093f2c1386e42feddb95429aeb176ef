Supply was cut off to the Ventersdorp and Naledi local municipalities at 6am on Monday morning. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it wants a plan of action from two defaulting municipalities in the North West on how they intend on paying back their debt before their power supply is reconnected. Supply was cut off to the Ventersdorp and Naledi local municipalities at 6am on Monday.Information from the Auditor-General has revealed that in the 2014/5 financial year, the Naledi Municipality recorded unauthorised expenditure of R29.7 million, irregular expenditure of R40.1 million and fruitless and wasteful expenditure of R510,000.At the same time, the Ventersdorp Municipality recorded unauthorised expenditure of R61.9 million, irregular expenditure of R130,000 and fruitless and wasteful expenditure of R5.6 million.Initially power to five municipalities was to be cut off, but the Mamusa Municipality in the North West settled some of its debt late on Sunday night.Two other municipalities in the Free State had until 10am to settle their accounts.Eskom interim CEO Matshela Koko says the parastatal needs to recover billions of rand as soon as possible. A council resolution would require a payment plan that deals with the area. We can make that resolution a court order, so if they don t pay they ll be in contempt of court.
