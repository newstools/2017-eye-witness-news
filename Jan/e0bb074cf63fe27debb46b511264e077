We must not go down in history books as a leadership collective that spends months or even years fighting in parliament and in society and was unable to move South Africa forward. He said unity is important for the ANC now this year. Help us to build it and shape it to become united and strong so that it can move out country forward. Zuma said under the leadership of the ANC, the country is in good hands.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
