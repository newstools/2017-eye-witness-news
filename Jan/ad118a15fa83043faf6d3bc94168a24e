REUTERS WASHINGTON BUREAU- President-elect Donald Trump called the controversy over Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential campaign a political witch hunt on Friday in an interview hours before he was to receive a US intelligence briefing on the topic. China, relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names, Trump told the New York Times, referring to the Office of Personnel Management breach in 2014 and 2015. How come nobody even talks about that? This is a political witch hunt. He said hackers have infiltrated the White House and Congress. We re like the hacking capital of the world, said Trump.
