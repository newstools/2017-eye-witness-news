The power utility is opposing an application by Afriforum to interdict it from flipping the switch to eight non-paying municipalities. PRETORIA Eskom has argued that it is empowered by law to cut power supply as a mechanism to recover debt. The state power utility is opposing an application in the High Court in Pretoria by lobby group Afriforum to interdict it from flipping the switch to eight non-paying municipalities. The towns in the Free State, North West and Northern Cape owe billions of rands in unpaid electricity dating back more than five years. Eskom has argued that it intends implementing the least invasive approach to disconnections by imposing structured cuts during peak hours in the morning and evenings. It has relied on case law which states that services may be withheld as a means to recover debt. The power utility further questioned Afriforum s role in the matter, saying the dispute was between the utility and the municipalities, and not the residents, whom they claim to act for. Eskom has given an undertaking that if the application fails, it will not disconnect the affected municipalities until next Tuesday. Afriforum has pleaded with the court to hold off on all such disconnections until its main application related to this practice is heard in March.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
