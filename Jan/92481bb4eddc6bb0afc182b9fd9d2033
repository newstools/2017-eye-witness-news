CAPE TOWN - Foreign tourism to the Western Cape in December has increased by 29% year on year.MEC for Economic Opportunities Alan Winde revealed tourism statistics earlier on Tuesday.The majority of the foreign visitors during the peak season were from Germany and the United Kingdom, while domestic visitors were mostly from Gauteng.Nine out of ten tourist attractions reported an increase in visitor numbers over the peak season.By far the greatest attraction was Table Mountain National Park with over 400,000 visitors.Winde says that the increase in visitors at key attractions, including the Cango Caves and Robben Island, is the payoff from a new focused approach to growing tourism and a surge in private investment. There are some areas where there's some flat lining, but off course we need to go back to the drawing board and say where we re seeing those numbers what can we do differently. The tourism industry currently provides more than 200,000 jobs and aims to create an additional 100,000 by 2019.LISTEN: Cape Town s latest tourism statistics(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
