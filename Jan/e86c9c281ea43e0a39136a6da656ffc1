The man who discovered the gospel star shares how a 16-year-old Lundi Tyamara was determined to succeed. JOHANNESBURG - The man who discovered gospel singer Lundi Tyamara says he was a tough man who was adamant to make it in the industry.Founder of Zuz'muzi Music, Tshepo Nzimande, says Tyamara was only 16 years old when he came to Johannesburg in 1995 and wanted to record his own album.Tyamara passed away just after midnight at the Edenvale Hospital at the age of 38.He was being treated there for Tuberculosis (TB) in the stomach and a liver condition.Nzimande says he will be remembered for his great work. I will remember Lundi as one of the toughest gospel artists I have ever seen because Lundi went through a lot in his time, to an extent where I thought that he was going to give up. There was all this bad publicity, which some of them were true but people would come on Thursday and not have a story and think - let me target Lundi because he is known for this. _LISTEN: Lundi- Ongqonngqozayo _(Edited by Neo Koza)
