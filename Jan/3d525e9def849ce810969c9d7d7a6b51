Michael Touloum is accused of wounding Simon Mmetli in the leg after finding him on his farm, carrying wood to make a fire. JOHANNESBURG The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is warning Limpopo police that if they do not arrest a man who they say attacked a 23-year-old at a farm outside Tzaneen, they will mobilise community members and arrest him themselves.Michael Touloum is accused of wounding Simon Mmetli in the leg after finding him on his farm carrying wood to make a fire.He was taken to hospital and a criminal case against Touloum was opened two weeks ago.The EFF s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says, We are cautioning them but if they do not, we are going to have to lead the community to do the citizen arrest of this white racist farmer who racially profiled Mmetli and shot him on his leg. The police s Motlafela Mojapelo has confirmed that no one has been arrested. We hope that in terms of the examination of the docket itself, appropriate steps will be taken. A case of theft against the victim has been opened, and one of attempted murder has been opened against the farmer. (Edited by Neo Koza)
