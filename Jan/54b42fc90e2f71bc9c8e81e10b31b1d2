Eskom is opposing the group's bid to prevent it from flipping the switch in the Free State, North West &amp; Northern Cape. PRETORIA- Eskom has undertaken not to immediately cut power to eight non-paying municipalities if AfriForum s application for an interdict against the power utility's move fails. Eskom is opposing the civil rights group's bid in the Pretoria High Court to prevent it from flipping the switch. Judgment is expected on Thursday morning. The towns in the Free State, North West and Northern Cape owe billions of rand in unpaid electricity bills dating back more than five years.Eskom says if AfriForum fails to secure its interdict, it will cut power to the affected municipalities from next Tuesday.Eskom has argued that it intends implementing the least invasive approach to disconnections by imposing structured cuts during peak hours in the mornings and evenings.Judge Hans Fabricius questioned AfriForum s rights to bring the application, considering the dispute was between Eskom and the municipalities and not the residents, whom it claims to represent.The organisation has asked the court to put the disconnections on hold until March, when it s main application to challenge the constitutionality of cutting power to entire municipalities, despite many residents paying their accounts, will be heard.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
