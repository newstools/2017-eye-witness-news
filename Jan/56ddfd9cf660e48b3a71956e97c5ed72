VinPro says early forecasts for 2017 show a similar result with more than a billion litres of wine expected. CAPE TOWN - Wine body VinPro says it has noticed a positive trend in wine exports. It says that early forecasts for 2017 show a similar result with more than a billion litres of wine expected.VinPro says that the recent fires will not have much of an impact on this number. However, it says that around 80 wine producers have been exiting the industry per year due to the low return on investment due to poor prices. But VinPro s Edo Heyns says exports reached R9 billion last year. With fewer grapes, we re getting higher value for the wine and now what is important is that this extra value goes down to the grape producer. At this stage, the cellars and the retail get their money and it has not filtered down to a producer on the ground. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
