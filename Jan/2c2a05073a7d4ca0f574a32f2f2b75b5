CAPE TOWN - A Paarl woman is still missing after her boyfriend was arrested in Port Elizabeth. Nicola Pienaar's partner was taken into custody over the weekend for being in possession of her mother's car, which had been reported stolen. The couple had left Paarl together earlier this month, but Pienaar's mother reported her missing after she became suspicious. Pienaar's boyfriend claims he left her in Oudtshoorn two days after they left Paarl after they had an argument. The 28-year-old woman has not been seen since. Her 32-year-old boyfriend remains in custody until his next court appearance on Friday. Port Elizabeth police say they are cooperating with the missing persons investigation launched by Paarl police.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
