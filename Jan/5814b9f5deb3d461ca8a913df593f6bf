From 10 January we are opening new schools and [during the school holidays we were] extending some of the schools using alternative technology, so we believe we can bring down that number substantially. Lesufi says, however, that he cannot guarantee a place for late applicants. It is very difficult for us to promise that there will be space in our schools. We might try to place them where there is still availability, but it would be an appeal.
