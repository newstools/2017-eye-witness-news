The party stalwarts are have indicated they still want to push for the event to be held before the policy conference in June. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress stalwarts say they'll meet with the party's top six next week to discuss the modalities of a consultative conference and have indicated they still want to push for it to be held before the party's policy conference in June.The party agreed to hold the consultative conference after the veterans requested it but said it would be held on the first two days of the policy gathering.But the stalwarts rejected that proposal saying that they want the conference to be separated from the policy gathering and that the two days were insufficient to discuss the problems facing the party. The group has previously raised concerns about the state of the party, saying it was deteriorating under President Jacob Zuma.ANC stalwarts say work will begin from now to consult within and outside the party as the group prepares for the consultative conference.Frank Chikane says they will also meet with alliance partners and other stakeholders in society. So we will be arranging meetings with the leagues of the ANC - youth league, women s league, veterans league. ANC Stalwart Murphy Morobe says there is a need to hold the conference as early as possible. The need is to emphasise out there the sense of urgency, not just for the party but it s also for the country as well. The stalwarts say they hope what will happen at the consultative conference will determine the direction the party takes.(Edited by Neo Koza)
