The City says the spike occurred in the second week of January when schools and industry re-opened and not during the festive season. CAPE TOWN The City of Cape Town has rubbished claims that a surge in visitors to the city contributed to high water usage over the festive season.Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson says peak water usage did not take place between mid-December and early January when visitor numbers were at its highest.The spike occurred in the second week of this month when schools and industry re-opened after the Christmas break.The City is trying to curtail water usage to 800 million litres per day. It s unfortunate that there s perception created that somehow having this active tourist industry is negative for us. I don t think that the impact to our water usage is that significant, and the benefits to our economy are so enormous. LISTEN: Cape Town's latest tourism statistics(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
