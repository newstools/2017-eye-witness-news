Eskom says it has made progress in discussions with premiers and mayors to replace existing meters with prepaid meters. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom CEO Matshela Koko says the utility has made progress in discussions with premiers and mayors to replace existing meters with prepaid meters, to prevent debt. Last week, the parastatal announced it will be cutting power to eight non-paying municipalities.Eskom has built up a debt of over R10 billion, with municipalities in the Free State, Mpumalanga, North West and the Northern Cape owing the utility about R10.2 billion. Koko says Eskom cannot borrow money to generate electricity for municipalities that simply don't pay. When they say Eskom tariff is expensive, that s because we were not able to recover our electricity. But it s also in contravention with the laws of the land because we re expected to recover the money. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
