WASHINGTON - The Boy Scouts of America said on Monday the group would begin accepting transgender boys, bucking its more than a century-old practice of using the gender stated on a birth certificate to determine eligibility.&quot;Starting today, we will accept and register youth in the Cub and Boy Scout programs based on the gender identity indicated on the application,&quot; Boy Scouts of America communications director Effie Delimarkos said in an emailed statement.Delimarkos cited shifting definitions of gender under state laws, which can &quot;vary widely from state to state,&quot; in explaining the change.She said that while the organisation offers programs for all youths, its Cub and Boy Scout programs are specifically for boys. The change will allow children to apply even if male is not listed on their birth certificate.Advocacy group Scouts for Equality applauded the move: &quot;This is another historic day for the Boy Scouts of America. The decision to allow transgender boys to participate in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts is an important step forward for this American institution.&quot;In 2013, the Boy Scouts voted to lift a ban on openly gay scouts that had been in place throughout the organisation's history after gay rights advocates gathered petitions with more than 1.8 million signatures in support of ending the ban.
