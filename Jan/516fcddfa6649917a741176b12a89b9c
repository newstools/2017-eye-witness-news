The party has moved to distance itself from allegations of a covert communications campaign but says those implicated face an internal probe. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) continues to distance itself from the alleged war room, but however says implicated individuals face an internal probe.A week ago, public relations specialist Sihle Bolani approached the courts saying she was not paid for helping to organise a covert communications campaign one the ANC claims individuals are responsible for.The party's general manager Ignatius Jacobs is listed by City Press as an endorser to the covert communications campaign through recordings where he and alleged war room architects met.Party spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says the party has never relied on dirty campaigns. If the general manager is involved in the fallout, and we are dealing with that internally. But as to the details on what happened including the recording of the meeting that has nothing to do with the ANC. City Press is reporting that recordings of a conversation between Jacobs, Bolani and Joseph Nkadimeng detail the intention to discredit opposition parties in a campaign costing R50 million.A TV broadcast in the background confirms the date of a meeting at Luthuli House in November.The paper says the recordings indicate Bolani was not to report to the party's headquarters, but directly to Shaka Sisulu and Nkadimeng. However, the recordings show there was a problem with raising the required funding.Jacobs repeatedly asked for updated reports from Bolani.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
