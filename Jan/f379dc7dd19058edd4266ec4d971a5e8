The NGO says it&#8217;s running at full capacity due to an influx in abandoned animals over the festive season. CAPE TOWN - The Cape of Good Hope Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) says it s struggling with the increased pressure of an increased intake of stray animals.The non-governmental organisation says it's running at full capacity due to an influx in abandoned animals over the festive season. It has taken in over 1,200 stray animals since the start of the holiday period.The organisation's Belinda Abrahams says this is an increase of 40%. We re bursting at seams in spite of our improved premises which enables us to keep 70% more dogs than previously. We still had to double up animals, and sometimes as many as three animals to on enclosure, which is not ideal. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
