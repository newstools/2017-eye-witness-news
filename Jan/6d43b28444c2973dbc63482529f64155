The Women&#8217;s League&#8217;s endorsement is the first for a specific candidate by a national section of the ANC. JOHANNESBURG The chances of South African President Jacob Zuma s ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, becoming the next leader of the African National Congress were given a boost on Saturday with the endorsement of the ruling party s women s division.The ANC will pick a new leader at a conference in December and, given its national dominance since coming to power at the end of apartheid in 1994, the winner is likely to go on to be South Africa s next president when elections are held in 2019.Dlamini-Zuma, the chairwoman of the African Union, is viewed as a frontrunner. She is a Zulu, the largest tribe in South Africa, and is expected to have the backing of her former husband, who will have a major say in who succeeds him.The Women s League s endorsement is the first for a specific candidate by a national section of the ANC and will intensify the debate over who will take the party forward after it suffered its worst local election results last year.Dlamini-Zuma was regarded as a capable technocrat during her time as South Africa s minister of home affairs between 2009 and 2012 and has since gained international exposure during her time as the first female head of the AU.However, critics of Dlamini-Zuma, a medical doctor trained in South Africa and Britain, say she should have done more to intervene when former president Thabo Mbeki denied that HIV causes AIDs and imposed anti-scientific policies.Mbeki s stance has been blamed by health activists for more than 300,000 preventable deaths. Dlamini-Zuma was foreign minister in Mbeki s cabinet and one of his closest allies.Vice President Cyril Ramaphosa, a unionist-turned-business tycoon, is viewed as her most likely rival after powerful trade unions endorsed him last year.Neither Dlamini-Zuma, 67, or Ramaphosa, 64, have declared their intention to run.Ramaphosa, who was once touted as a successor to Nelson Mandela, would be the first choice for many investors because his background in commerce suggests he will support more pro-business policies than many in the traditionally left-wing ANC.However, he will face criticism from opponents for his role at platinum producer Lonmin where he was a director and shareholder when violence led to police shooting dead 34 striking miners in 2012. An investigation has cleared him of wrongdoing.The Women s League has a block of votes at the party conference and are a critical lobbying group for the ANC, particularly in galvanising support among female voters. After careful consideration and opening our eyes as wide as possible, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is the only suitable candidate, the Women s League said in a statement. Her legacy and influence is known and well documented throughout the history pages of the republic and beyond. Many South Africans believe it is time the ANC had a female leader, a rarity on a continent with strong patriarchal heritage. Zuma has previously said that South Africa is ready for a female president.
