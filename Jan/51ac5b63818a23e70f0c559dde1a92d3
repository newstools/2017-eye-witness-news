Dlamini announced the partnership between her department and the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) at a briefing in Pretoria on Tuesday.The minister says of the 188,000 grant beneficiaries who wrote matric exams, 83% qualified to further their studies for either a diploma or degree. Despite the conditions of our vulnerable children, 41% percent managed to receive a bachelor s pass, which gives them entry to any tertiary education institution. These students should automatically qualify for funding to pursue their studies. (Edited by Tamsin Wort)
