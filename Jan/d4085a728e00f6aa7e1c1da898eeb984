News broadcaster eNCA says it is only being allowed to transmit President Zuma&#8217;s speech through a feed controlled by the ANC. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) has strongly denied claims on social media and from television news channel eNCA that it s trying to control how its 8 January event on Sunday is broadcast.New broadcaster eNCA says it is only being allowed to transmit President Jacob Zuma s speech through a feed controlled by the ANC, and that the party is trying to control how and when it films members of the crowd during that speech.Zuma has been twice been booed at the FNB stadium in Soweto and the Gauteng ANC has previously said he should consider stepping down.The party s Khusela Sangoni says the news channel has misunderstood what is happening here and that they are allowed to bring extra cameras to this event. We have no intention of giving them the freedom and latitude to do as they wish. So they have asked for an extra camera, so they got an extra camera. But eNCA editor in chief Anton Harber says they re going too far. While I understand that they need to manage the media at a major event, I think they are overreaching and asking for too great a control over how we cover it. The ANC also claims eNCA failed to attend several planning meetings ahead of this event.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
