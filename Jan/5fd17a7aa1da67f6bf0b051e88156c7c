Our catchup plan that we ve implemented worked for us and we re therefore anticipating good results from the province. Minister Angie Motshekga is due to reveal the highly anticipated national matric pass rate for the class of 2016 on Wednesday and her department says it has every confidence in the independently checked results.Over 800,000 pupils sat for the exams across the country.The class of 2015 achieved a 70.7% pass rate, a 5% drop from the previous year.The wait is almost over for the class of 2016 as the country will learn later today how the matrics have performed.Last year saw the Western Cape come up tops and they were closely followed by Gauteng.The three worst performing provinces were Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.While the national pass rate will be made public on Wednesday, individual results will be released on Thursday.The department says that results for two schools implicated in a mathematics exam paper leaks scandal in Limpopo will be withheld, pending the outcome of an investigation.To get your 2016 IEB matric results now go to EWN s special matric results page.
