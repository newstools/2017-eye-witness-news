While one father has made peace, a mother says Molemo Maarohanye's release has opened up old and painful wounds. JOHANNESBURG - The father of one of the four pupils killed by Molemo 'Jub-Jub' Maarohanye says he holds no grudges against the hip hop singer after he was released on parole o n Thursday.Fezekile Cwayi says he's made peace with his son Mlungisi's death at the age of 18, reportedly saying he was a clever child and would have passed matric.He says he and his wife have forgiven the pair who were drag racing in Soweto in 2010 when they hit and killed four children and left two others brain damaged.However, the mother of another child who was killed says she's heartbroken and that Maarohanye and Tshabalala's release has opened old and painful wounds. Meanwhile, the Justice Project South Africa has described the move to release the pair on parole as unfortunate.The organisation's Howard Dembovsky says the state should have used this case to emphasise its stance on drinking and driving instead of releasing them this early. We also can t dictate how much [time] someone should be spending in prison for driving under the influence of alcohol to start with. What we can say though is that if you're going to use this as a deterrent then going and diminishing, that deterrent is not really the way to go. (Edited by Neo Koza)
