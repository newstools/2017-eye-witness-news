JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) secretary general Gwede Mantashe says the governing party is facing a number of challenges, one of them being what he calls accidental leadership succession.Mantashe has been tackling issues that are destroying the ANC ahead of the party s 105th-anniversary celebrations this weekend.He says corruption, factionalism and accidental leadership are problems that cannot be ignored.The party secretary general says there s no shortage of corruption and thieves, and that certain members are also loyal to different leaders.But he points out that choosing leaders must be based on merit and not popularity. Everybody just raises a hand and in the process gets elected leader, without scrutinising whether this person has a track record or commitment, or is this person serving the people. In that situation we end up with a leadership with no insight. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
