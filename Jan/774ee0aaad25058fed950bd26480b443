CAPE TOWN - Cape Town has been named as one of the top 50 most desirable cities where the world s wealthy should invest in property.The report was released by Wealth X, a wealth information business.London, New York and Tokyo were named as the most desirable cities, with Cape Town coming in at number 37 and Johannesburg at 46.Property expert at Remax Stephen Delit says property along the Atlantic Seaboard does not come cheap. The Atlantic Seaboard, the average price there for an apartment is R5.7 million and household is R14.8 million. So prices have gotten gigantic in the Atlantic Seaboard and it s driving up prices all over. Delit says with apps like Uber, residents staying in town also have no need for cars or parking. The Foreshore is also doing very well. In that immediate vicinity are all new buildings; you ve got hotels going up which also have residential components and the need to be closer to the city where people are using Uber. Delit adds language also plays a part in wealthy buyers deciding to drop some cash. The great advantage that we have is our language. Most people in Cape Town speak English. It s a still a foreign country where you hear different languages, but people coming from Europe feel very comfortable here, they never feel lost because people speak their language.
