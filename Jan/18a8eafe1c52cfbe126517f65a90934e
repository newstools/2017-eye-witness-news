JOHANNESBURG - Ford says it has been compiling information on what has led to its Kuga model to catch fire and this has taken time. The company has come under pressure to explain why it has taken so long to take action. A number of Kuga's have caught fire, with the company on Monday announcing a recall of the 1.6l Kuga made between December 2012 and February 2014. Ford South Africa CEO Jeff Nemeth says that 15 engines were sent overseas for testing.&quot;Based on the current data, we have determined that the fires were due to overheating, caused by a lack of coolant circulation, whcih can lead to a crack in the cylinder head and therefore an oil leak.&quot;Nemeth says that more than 4,500 Kugas need to be recalled for repairs as a safety precaution.He says that it's understandable that customers have lost faith in the Ford brand.&quot;I think it is understandable that customers are going to be concerned about this and some customers might have lost faith in the Ford brand and it is up to us to rebuild that and I think the best way to do that, is to take a disciplined approach to ensuring that these vehicles are fixed and that our customers are safe.&quot;
