The ANC instructed its members not to take part in the event, while members of other parties have also decided not to take part. JOHANNESBURG - Organisers of the South African Politician Awards say despite numerous politicians declining their nominations, the ceremony in Cape Town is still set to continue on the eve of the State of the Nation Address next month. The African National Congress (ANC) has instructed its members not to take part in the event, while members of other parties have also decided not to take part. Organiser of the event, Veronica Modieleng, says they have not been deterred by the number of politicians who have declined being nominated.She says the awards are important because many have a poor opinion of politicians.&quot;So how about we bring something positive, something that will push these politicians to perform better because they have to account to the people.&quot;Modieleng says no one is sponsoring the event although they do have a gift sponsor.&quot;You have to plan, raise money and do other things that will raise money.&quot;Meanwhile, the ANC has instructed its member to disengage from the event.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
