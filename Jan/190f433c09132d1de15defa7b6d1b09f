We understand the high level of concern, we are not aware of any injuries that have resulted from our engines.Thirty-three-year-old Reshall Jimmy died in his Kuga in December 2015 when his car caught alight but Ford says this was a unique and an unrelated incident.The Jimmy family disagrees and will be holding a media briefing tomorrow.The National Consumer Commission (NCC) says it ordered Ford to implement precautionary measures but when more Kuga's caught alight it authorised a safety recall.The commission's Ebrahim Mohamed says first they instructed Ford to take precautionary measures which resulted in free maintenance checks.
