Smh #Sakhumzi#Sakhumzi, this doesn&#39;t smell like robbery shame.Criminals are too brazen. Everyday they steal and kill and most get away with it. #SakhumziWe shouldn&#39;t only focus on crime when places like #Sakhumzi are attacked. Lets set action against crime in all corners.I guess the price to pay for success is that high more like priceless, why did a 60 year old have to die like that? #Sakhumzi(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
