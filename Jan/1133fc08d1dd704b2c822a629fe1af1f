Pravin Gordhan has asked a court to give a declaratory order as to whether he can force the big banks to keep doing business with the Guptas. CAPE TOWN Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan says he is not all worried about how his court case involving the Gupta family and their companies could end, as he simply wants legal clarity on the issue.Gordhan has asked a court to give a declaratory order as to whether he can force the big banks to keep doing business with the Guptas, after saying their firms had been involved in R6.8 billion worth of suspicious transactions. The Finance Minister is currently at the World Economic Forum meeting in Switzerland.Last month, FirstRand said that suspicions of money-laundering lay behind its decision to cut ties with the business family linked to allegations of influence-peddling in President Jacob Zuma s government.FirstRand, South Africa s biggest bank by market value, is the first lender to publicly disclose reasons for severing links last year with Oakbay Investments, a company controlled by the Gupta brothers.Between December 2015 and April 2016, all four major banks, including Standard Bank, Nedbank and Barclays Africa, terminated the accounts of companies controlled by the Gupta family without making their reasons public.Additional reporting by Reuters(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
