There&#8217;s growing anger at his executive order clamping down on immigration to the US and the petition says he shouldn't be allowed to meet the queen. LONDON More than 880,000 people have signed a petition in the United Kingdom (UK) to cancel a proposed state visit to Britain by United States (US) President Donald Trump. There s growing anger at his executive order clamping down on immigration to the US and the petition says he shouldn't be allowed to meet the queen. Trump was invited to the UK this year by Queen Elizabeth. The visit was announced during his highly successful meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May last week.However, shortly afterwards, the president also announced wide-ranging restrictions on those entering the US which have been roundly condemned.Now a member of the British public has begun an online petition on an official government website, saying he should be allowed to come, but not on a state visit.The numbers signing have already exceeded the minimum required for the petition to have to be debated in parliament.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
