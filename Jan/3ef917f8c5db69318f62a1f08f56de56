Kenny Motsamai will be granted full parole after serving 27 years in prison for the murder of a white traffic officer in 1989. JOHANNESBURG The Pan African Congress (PAC) says the release of struggle prisoner Kenny Motsamai is a bitter sweet moment as it reminds them of the many fighters still behind bars.Motsamai will be granted full parole after serving 27 years in prison for the murder of a white traffic officer in 1989.This comes after a bid from the PAC and numerous civil rights organisations to have him released after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission denied him amnesty.The PAC says the release of Motsamai may be cause for celebration but it proves how little is being done by the African National Congress (ANC) to ensure all those who fought for freedom are recognised.Spokesperson Kenneth Mokgatlhe says, So we re saying to the ANC that they must go back as they did during the government of President Thabo Mbeki because in that period we saw lots of our cadres being released and the issue was taken more seriously. He says it is shocking that 133 prisoners are still behind bars. So it means that we ve not done adequately to ensure that all political prisoners from all political parties are released. The party and members of other organisations will meet at the Boksburg Correctional Services Centre for Motsamai s official release. Thereafter festivities will commence at his Katlehong home.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
