Authorities have arrested more than 250 people for robbery and acts of vandalism around the country this week. JOHANNESBURG - A hefty government gas price hike is still fuelling protests, looting and road blockades in Mexico. Authorities arrested more than 250 people for robbery and acts of vandalism around the country this week. Some protests have been peaceful, but in other parts of the country, people ransacked stores or clamoured to get fuel.Officials announced in December that they were planning to increase gas prices, in some cases more than 20%. Some protesters say their frustration with the government is about much more with the president facing criticism for his handling of the country's drug war, alleged corruption and his decision to meet with Donald Trump during the US presidential campaignMexicans angry over the double-digit hike in gasoline prices looted stores and blockaded roads on Wednesday. Twenty-three stores were sacked and 27 blockades put up in Mexico City, Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said, days after the government raised gasoline costs by 14 to 20%, outraging Mexicans already battling rising inflation and a weak currency.Mexican retailers' association ANTAD urged federal and state authorities to intervene quickly, saying 79 stores had been sacked and 170 forcibly closed due to blockades.Deputy interior Minister Rene Juarez said over 250 people had been arrested for vandalism and that federal authorities were working with security officials in Mexico City and the nearby states of Mexico and Hidalgo to address the unrest.&quot;These acts are outside the law and have nothing to do with peaceful protest nor freedom of expression,&quot; Juarez said in a press conference late on Wednesday.Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said earlier on Wednesday that the price spike that took effect on 1 January was a &quot;responsible&quot; measure that the government took in line with international oil prices.The hike is part of a gradual, year-long price liberalisation the Pena Nieto administration has promised to implement this year.State oil company Pemex said on Tuesday that blockades of fuel storage terminals by protesters had led to a &quot;critical situation&quot; in at least three Mexican states.Additional reporting by Reuters.
