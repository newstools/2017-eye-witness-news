Ezra Abrahams &amp; Shamiel Cupido ran a vehicle maintenance scheme which cost the municipality more than R2 million in kickbacks. CAPE TOWN - Two former Drakenstein Municipality senior managers will spend 10 years behind bars for fraud and corruption. The daughter of one of the officials, also found guilty of corruption, was sentenced to three years of correctional supervision. They were all sentenced in the Paarl Regional Court for their role in a vehicle maintenance scheme which cost the municipality more than R2 million in kickbacks. Ezra Abrahams and Shamiel Cupido entered into corrupt relations with three automotive companies between 2004 and 2006. The National Prosecuting Authority says they received kickbacks from the businesses for referring municipal vehicles for service. In one instance, Abrahams and Cupido double invoiced the municipality to the tune of more than R170,000. They also submitted fictitious invoices for services that were not rendered. Abrahams daughter Vanessa Abrahams was employed by one of the businesses and it's understood she facilitated some of the fraudulent deals.
