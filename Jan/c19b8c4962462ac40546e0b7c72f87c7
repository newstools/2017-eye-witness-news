Afriforum says while it sympathises with Eskom, it believes debt recovery shouldn&#8217;t be at the expense of paying consumers. PRETORIA Lobby group Afriforum says it sympathises with Eskom s efforts to recover debt but still believes the rights of law-abiding consumers should be upheld. It was responding to the High Court in Pretoria s decision to dismiss an application to stop the power utility from cutting power to non-paying municipalities. The councils in the Free State, North West and Northern Cape have until next week to settle their accounts or their power will be cut.Afriforum s Marcus Pawson says they recognise Eskom s right to recover debt, but believe it shouldn t be at the expense of consumers who do pay their bills. It s an unfortunate judgment, but we do sympathise with Eskom in trying to get in revenue for services rendered. We applaud the good financial standards that they want to apply. Eskom s Matshela Koko says the utility s growing debt prompted this response. We are sitting at R9 billion. We project to end the year at R12 billion. We can t borrow money to generate electricity to give it to municipalities that don t pay. If the affected municipalities fail to settle their accounts by next week, power will be cut during peak times in the mornings and evenings.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
