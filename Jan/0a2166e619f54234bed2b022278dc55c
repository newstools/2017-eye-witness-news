Authorities say border officials are fully prepared to cope with the thousands of additional people trying to get through Beitbridge border. HARARE - The number of travellers flooding into Zimbabwe has skyrocketed this festive season.Authorities say border officials are fully prepared to cope with the thousands of additional people trying to get through Beitbridge Border Post.Seems that holiday Beitbridge travellers just grit their teeth and get on with it, and this year there have been 185,000 more travellers than last year.Regional immigration officer at the border Notius Tarisai has told the Herald that more than half a million people came into Zimbabwe through Beitbridge in the first 27 days of December.That figure is higher than the number of Zimbabweans leaving for South Africa, and no doubt reflects the number of locals working in South Africa who wish to be with their families for Christmas.Shops and tourist destinations are popular with diasporans and the cash they bring will be particularly welcome to cash-strapped businesses this year.Traffic is believed to be much quieter at Beitbridge at the moment: most years it peaks again after New Year's Day.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
