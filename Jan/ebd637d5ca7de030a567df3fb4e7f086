We didn t anticipate that the situation will reach schools in the area because this is not a school issue. Initially it was about service delivery. Police have been on alert in and around Vuwani since early last year, when around 30 schools were either razed or vandalised during protests over demarcation.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
