The SAPS centre in Port Elizabeth has already fallen victim to the problems. CAPE TOWN - Operators at the police s 10111 call centres are concerned staff shortages will cripple service delivery.The South African Police Service (SAPS) centre in Port Elizabeth has already fallen victim to the problems and had more than 400 calls reportedly going unanswered this week. The centre has less than 15 people on a shift manning more than 20 phone lines.Last month, call centre agents in Gauteng threatened to go on strike because of an apparent lower pay compared to their Western Cape counterparts.The SA Police Union's Andre Scheepers says a lack of manpower poses a risk: The situation in December, with high numbers of missed calls and staff spending more time on a call, is an indication of what could happen if this is not addressed. That could be detrimental to the community and people who may require emergency services. The union's general secretary Oscar Skommere says Gauteng's issues were raised a few years ago. With the new management the employees realised that those things are not possible and that s where the problem started, resulting in them deciding to go on strike. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
