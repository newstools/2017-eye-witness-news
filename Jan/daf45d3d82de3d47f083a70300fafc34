So far, there are more than $72 million worth of bond notes in circulation in much smaller denominations. ZIMBABWE - Zimbabwe's central bank governor says he'll start introducing $5 bond notes, but only in March.So far, there are more than $72 million worth of bond notes in circulation in much smaller denominations. However, this hasn t stopped bank queues.Central Bank Governor John Mangudya isn t happy with bank cues, apparently because he wants locals to use plastic money .The authority said from the start it would drip-feed the bond notes into the banking system.It s not clear how many $5 notes will be introduced, but it s likely they ll still be viewed with some suspicion, particularly by those who have to import.The bright green bond notes were accepted by most businesses and black market traders.At independence from Britain in 1980, Zimbabwe was regarded as one of Africa's most promising prospects. But its economy has nearly halved since 2000 after the violent seizure of white-owned commercial farms and disastrous printing of money.The secrecy of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) around the release of the notes, including its failure to publish security features or say where they are being printed, has heightened fears it will print more than a stated $200 million issuance limit.The RBZ first announced plans to introduce the bond notes in May to address the chronic cash shortages and supplement the dwindling US dollars that have been in circulation for the past seven years.However, the announcement was followed by a run on the banks as Zimbabweans tried to empty their accounts of hard currency.Even if they do not depreciate in value, many economists say the bond notes will serve only as a sticking plaster for an economy with a $250 million-per-month trade deficit.In addition to weak exports, Zimbabwe has had to deal with a devastating drought that has left millions facing hunger and boosted the need for food imports.Zimbabwe is $1.6 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank, outstanding debt that prevents Harare from securing any extra financing from the two institutions or the International Monetary Fund._Additional reporting by Reuters. _ (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
