The party says it has evidence proving the health minister requested private data about members who access public sector services. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it intends laying a formal complaint against the Council for Medical Schemes (CMS). The party says it's in possession of evidence proving Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi requested that the CMS collect private data about medical scheme members who access services in the public sector.The DA s Wilmot James says, The medical aids are willing to provide that information as long as it is anonymized, which means they ll provide the data but will think about private information. It seems the minister wants more than that. But the Health Department's Joe Maila says the claims are misleading. There is nothing unconstitutional about what we re doing. We wanted to use the information requested to make sure we understand and we re not looking for private information. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
