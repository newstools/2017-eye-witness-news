Parents have been gathering at Badirileng High in Khutsong in the hope that their children will be placed there. JOHANNESBURG The Gauteng Department of Education says it's confident that all pupils who were looking to be admitted at the Badirileng High School in Khutsong on the West Rand, will be placed at other schools in the area.About 50 parents have been gathering at the school from the beginning of the week, in the hope that their children will be placed there. On Tuesday, the department committed to opening a new school every month to help alleviate the pressure on schools in the province.The department says parents should refrain from going to schools but they should rather go to a centre that has been set up in the area.Spokesperson Oupa Bodibe says, They were told to go to a school where the department has set up a centre to assist parents who are walking in for the first time. He says parents should not try to use the online portal to apply as it has been shut down. We shut down the portal in November because the deadline (for online applications) was 1 June 2016, we extended it to November and then said to parents they could only get help at the district office. As the number of unplaced pupils has dropped to 35,000 the department says it's confident that all pupils will be placed at a school in the province soon.62 OPERATIONS CENTRES SET UP TO ASSIST The department says it has set up 62 operations centres across the province to help parents with admissions, including those applying for the first time.The department says the first day of the 2017 academic year kicked off smoothly on Wednesday, despite a few disruptions.The department officially opened the newly built Nomzamo Madikizela-Mandela primary school in Soweto.MEC Lesufi says his department is working to ensure that all children are accommodated. Last year we placed the last learner on 2 May. Parents must not panic; we are working very hard with our district offices. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
