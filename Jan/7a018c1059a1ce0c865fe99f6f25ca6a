Reports emerged that ANCWL President Bathabile Dlamini addressed a crowd while allegedly drunk in Germiston. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Women s League (ANCWL) has denied reports that its president delivered a speech while drunk and has also distanced itself from comments made by ministerial spokesperson Lumka Olifant.Earlier this week, reports emerged that Social Development Minister and League President Bathabile Dlamini addressed a crowd while allegedly drunk in Germiston on Friday.Her spokesperson Olifant then took to social media to defend the minister using defamatory language and swearing at her detractors.#ANCWL Has responded to posts by Spokesperson Lumka Olifant saying while they agree that Bathabile Dlamini is wrongly accused of alcohol 1/2#ANCWL 2/2 abuse, the league does not condone a social media post by Olifant using defamatory language to defend Dlamini. MKThe league s spokesperson Toko Xasa says while Olifant is correct in denying the alcohol abuse reports, she should not have lashed out in the manner she did. We would not have encouraged, by any means, such language. We hope the president will also deal with that from the office because by all means we expect people to communicate in a language in line with how society has to hear your message.
