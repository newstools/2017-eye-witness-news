Motata has been on paid special leave since 2007 when he drove his Jaguar into the wall of a Johannesburg house while under the influence. JOHANNESBURG It s unclear if High Court Judge Nkola Motata - who was convicted of drunk driving in 2009 - will appeal the latest judgment against him. Yesterday, the high court dismissed with costs his application to declare a judicial conduct committee and tribunal set up to investigate him as unconstitutional.Motata has been on paid special leave since 2007 when he drove his Jaguar into the wall of a Johannesburg house while under the influence.In a strongly worded ruling on Tuesday, Judge Dhaya Pillay questioned aspects of Motata s conduct, including why he hasn t owned up to his drunk driving offence.Pillay says that Motata has not raised a genuine constitutional dispute and therefore delaying this matter any further is unwarranted.Motata was due to face a tribunal in 2013 but proceedings were postponed pending his application.Now that Motata has lost his bid to dodge the tribunal, a new date will be set and if he is found guilty of gross misconduct, it could lead to his impeachment.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
