The ruling party says that the Democratic Alliance leader&#8217;s visit to Israel only serves to endorse the &#8220;oppressor&#8221;. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has condemned Mmusi Maimane s trip to Israel, saying that the Democratic Alliance (DA) leader acted against the movement of the world to isolate the state which it says continues to abuse and undermine human rights. The ruling party says that Maimane s visit only serves to endorse the oppressor and also undermines the Constitution of his own country which promotes human rights.The ANC's Zizi Kodwa says that it is clear that the DA will not stand with Palestine and is unwilling to challenge the Israeli government. The DA is trying to create confusion in terms of authority and foreign policy. They re undermining the Constitution because the Constitution of South Africa states very clear where the authority of the foreign policy lies. .@MmusiMaimane has also met with senior representatives of the Palestinian &amp; Israeli business community.This is in keeping with the DA&#39;s commitment to a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine exist side by side.The DA's Mabine Seabe, however, says that the ANC has no leg to stand on when it comes to issues of human rights. We take it as a complement that they re concerned with the work that the DA is doing and that they realise that the DA has won the hearts and minds of more South Africans and that we re headed to the Union Buildings. In that regard we re going to work to more international leaders across the world. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
