The two were struck from the roll in September 2016 for their handling of the case against crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli. PRETORIA - The High Court in Pretoria has ruled that senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) officials Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi may appeal the decision that they be struck off the roll of advocates. The pair were struck from the roll in September last year for their handling of the case against crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli. They have since been placed on special leave and no longer report for duty at the NPA head offices. While Judge Francis Legodi and Judge Wendy Huges concurred in their ruling last year which struck Jiba and Mrwebi from the roll, they reached different conclusions into Monday s judgment. While Legodi felt there was no reasonable prospect of another court reaching a different conclusion, Huges was convinced otherwise. She believes the higher court would properly pronounce on the roles of an advocate in respect of the Admissions of Advocates Act. Jiba and Mrwebi had argued that the decisions they took were done so in good faith and in the execution of their duties. The matter will now be referred to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein.
