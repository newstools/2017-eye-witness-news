While the party has agreed to the conference it's said it will be held on the first two days of the policy gathering in June. JOHANNESBURG - Stalwarts of the African National Congress (ANC) will be meeting with the party's top six later on Monday morning to discuss the particulars of a consultative conference and say the meeting is also part of an ongoing process of introspection to find solutions to the challenges currently facing the organisation and the country at large.The party agreed to the conference after a request from the veterans but said it would be held on the first two days of the policy gathering in June.But the stalwarts rejected this proposal saying two days are insufficient to discuss challenges facing the party. ANC stalwarts say the meeting will be used to address concerns raised by veterans on what they say is the deteriorating state of the party under President Jacob Zuma s leadership.But the stalwarts will also use the meeting to negotiate with the party's leaders for the consultative conference to be separated from the policy conference. They also expected to call for civil society organisations to be allowed to participate in the ANC conference.(Edited by Neo Koza)
