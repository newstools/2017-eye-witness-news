The nine-year-old girl was found playing with other children in another part of the beach. CAPE TOWN A nine-year-old girl who went missing at Strand Beach earlier on Sunday has been found. She was found playing with other children in another part of the beach. Thousands of swimmers were earlier evacuated from the beach as lifeguards and rescue workers searched for her.The girl was swimming at the beach, where around 40,000 people had gathered on the first day of the year, when she disappeared.The city s JP Smith says, Life Saving and the NSRI are patrolling the beach front and have evacuated all the people out of the water so that they can see if anybody is drifting in the water and to see if they can find the nine-year-old. Smith says there have been a few such incidents along the False Bay coast on Sunday morning. We had an abandoned child, about one year six months which we found along False Bay with no clothes and a hospital blanket wrapped around him, where they could not find the parents. Those parents have since been found. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
