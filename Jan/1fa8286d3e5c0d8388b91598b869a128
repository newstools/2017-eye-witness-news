Relatives of Tsakani Shimange say they&#8217;re disappointed that a Tshwane metro police officer accused of murder was granted bail. PRETORIA - Relatives of the motorist killed by a Tshwane metro police officer say that while they re disappointed that the constable has been granted bail, they are eager to see justice served. The Pretoria Magistrates Court on Friday granted bail of R5,000 to Constable Thakatso Mashego. The officer is accused of murdering 38-year-old Tsakani Shimange, who died from a single gunshot wound to the chest after being stopped in Hatfield exactly a week ago. More than two dozen of Shimange's relatives and friends travelled to the capital from Giyani in Limpopo to witness the court proceedings. They expressed shock as Mashego was granted bail. A relative, who declined to be identified, says justice must now be served. The law must take its course. Even (Oscar) Pistorius was given bail, so let the law that it course. #HatfieldShooting Shimange s friends and relatives have travelled from Giyani to be here. The courtroom simply isn t being enough. BBThe defence attorney for Mashego says justice has been served, despite outrage from the victim s relatives.Attorney Peter Jay says he s satisfied with the court s ruling: It s in the interest of justice for the court to have released my client on bail and justice shouldn t just be done, it should also be seen to be done. The Constitution entitles you to your own opinion and also to lash out to the media or court within boundaries of course. The matter resumes in February.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
