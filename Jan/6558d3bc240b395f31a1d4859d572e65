PRETORIA - The High court in Pretoria has dismissed an application from the basis of urgency by two pre-dominantly Afrikaans-speaking schools to stop the placement of additional English pupils in their classrooms.Ho rskool Montana and Ho rskool Overkruin argued that they had insufficient capacity to accommodate the pupils.The court heard that the two schools served notice of the interdict application on the Gauteng Education Department last night, which meant officials weren t given time to file responding papers.The judge found that the schools did not follow the rules of court and the deviation from those rules was so absurd that the matter would not be heard. The schools had however submitted that this matter was not about language policy, but resources. They say they do accommodate English pupils but are unable to accommodate an additional two classes each, as instructed by the department. Counsel for the parties say they will take instructions from their clients before deciding on their next step.(Edited by Neo Koza)
