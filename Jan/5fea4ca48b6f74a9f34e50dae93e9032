The party says the inquiry into the SABC board proves the ANC politically interfered at the public broadcaster. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of the People (Cope) says the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) inquiry has exposed the rot in the public broadcaster.Parliament s inquiry into the SABC board is nearing its final stages as former board chairpersons Ellen Tshabalala and Ben Ngubane appeared before the committee on Friday.Last month the committee heard evidence alleging that both played a role in former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng s rise to power at the public broadcaster.Cope s Dennis Bloem says the statements by Tshabalala, Lukhanyo Calata, Vuyo Mvoko and others is more than enough evidence that the African National Congress politically interfered at the public broadcaster.He says he believes Cope has been a victim of the political interference. It is taking place as we speak now. This thing will only stop when Parliament puts it foot down and proper oversight is put in place by Parliament. LISTEN: Recap: SABC inquiry wraps up for 2016Last month, witnesses painted a bleak picture of political interference, censorship and SABC funds being channeled to support the Gupta TV channel, ANN7.The committee also heard that Motsoeneng usurped power from former CEO Lulama Mokhobo.The former CEO said she was treated with contempt by many in the organisation, including Motsoeneng who went over her head on big decisions.It also emerged that Communications Minister Faith Muthambi put pressure on the public broadcaster s board to permanently appoint Motsoeneng.Muthambi, who was grilled by the committee when she testified, said the board s failure to exercise its duties was not her responsibility alone.The minister also denied interfering with editorial decisions at the SABC.Additional reporting by Gaye Davis.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
