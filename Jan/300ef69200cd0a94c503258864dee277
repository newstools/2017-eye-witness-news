The court ordered the department to release the results of the pupils implicated in the Limpopo math paper leak within 72 hours. JOHANNESBURG The basic education department says it's disappointed with the ruling of the Thohoyandou High Court in Limpopo regarding the release of the matric results of students implicated in a recent math paper leak scandal.On Saturday the court ordered the department to release the results of the pupils from the Giyani High School and New Era College within 72 hours.Both schools were implicated in the leaked mathematics paper two question paper last year and the department has blocked the results of all subjects of affected candidates, while they are still investigating the matter.The department says it s looking at other measures to challenge the decision by the court.Last week the New Era College lodged an urgent interdict for the department to release the results of its candidates except those of mathematics.The judgment has ordered both national and provincial education department to release the results of the implicated pupils from the college in Malamulele.The department s Elijah Mhlanga says they believes another court will come to a different ruling. This court ruling has the potential of showing people that you can cheat, go to the court, secure your results and go ahead with other things that you want to do. New Era s school governing body spokesperson Matimba Ndlovu says they're satisfied with the ruling. For now we feel all is well, although we will only breathe a sigh of relief once we have the results in our hands. Basic education says the judgment is compromising examinations and they will advise the province and Umalusi to appeal.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
