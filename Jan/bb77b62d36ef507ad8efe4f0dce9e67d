PRETORIA - Eyewitness News has learnt that Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane will approach a court on Wednesday to stop what he believes is a malicious campaign to discredit him. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has broadened the scope of its investigation and is trying to establish how Phahlane bought and financed at least six cars, including luxury vehicles, over the last three years. This latest development comes a week after investigators searched his property in the north of Pretoria as part of a corruption investigation.The police s Sally de Beer has told EWN that court proceedings will take place soon.De Beer says the information on how Phahlane bought and financed several vehicles was leaked unlawfully in an attempt to defame and humiliate him. EWN has seen an affidavit from a car dealer, who states that he bought a Hilux bakkie for Phahlane to use for 18 months. The man says while he derived no benefit from the deal, he had hoped to include Phahlane as a black empowerment partner in future business ventures. Ipid s Moses Dlamini says he won t comment on the matter because it s part of an ongoing investigation. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
