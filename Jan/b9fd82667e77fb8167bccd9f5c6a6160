Sipho Pityana says the ANC needs to first consider what it wants its leaders to be before deciding on a name. DAVOS - Save South Africa convener Sipho Pityana says the way the African National Congress (ANC) is trying to suppress open discussion about who its next leader should be is exactly how the party ended up being led by President Jacob Zuma.He also says that while Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is a good leader, the party needs to first consider what it wants its leaders to be before deciding on a name.He s currently in Davos for the World Economic Forum.Pityana s point about the current bid by the ANC to stop the succession debate is a simple one: Exactly the process we are going through now of trying to suppress open conversation about leadership, landed us in a situation where we identified the wrong leader. And he says that the party shouldn t yet be discussing names. We can t just move without having a thorough conversation about how did we end up with Zuma as a leader, who clearly when we elected him, showed signs of somebody who is unethical. Pityana also says it can t be right that people say they want a woman leader and then name that leader without first considering all the female leaders that may be available.WATCH: Pityana: Africa is 'Cinderella' in #WEF storyFor more news, analysis and insights on Davos 2017 go to EWN s WEF portal in partnership with Ashburton Investments.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
