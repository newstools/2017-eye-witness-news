The salty water is used for medicinal purposes in some cultures. CAPE TOWN - A Port Alfred company has been given the green light to transport and sell sea water to customers in Gauteng.The salty water is used for medicinal purposes in some cultures.Managing director Guy Snyman says that his company PA Beverages received a letter from the Eastern Cape government granting permission for the operation to go ahead. He adds that if all goes well, the first load will be distributed within one month.Snyman says that the water will be pumped from the sea into a container and transported to a nearby factory. The one machine is a 1 litre. There is a one litre sachet like a milk sachet. So basically we extract the water. I did a conversion on the machine which adds two table spoons of sand to every sachet because they won t buy the water if there is no sand in it because they think it s not genuine sea water. The machine does forty-one litre sachets a minute. (Edited by Neo Koza)
