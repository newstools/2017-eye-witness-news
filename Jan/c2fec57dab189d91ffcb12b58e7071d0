Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the party sends condolences to the family and friends of the gospel legend. We also express that this is a loss to the EFF members across the board, because Lundi was a true artist who graced us with his performances at a time when it was not fashionable and many artists did not wanted to be associated to the EFF. We would like to express our revolutionary condolences to his family. May his soul rest in perfect revolutionary peace. #EFF: May his soul rest in perfect revolutionary peace!
