CAPE TOWN - Schools in the Eastern Cape are in need of teachers and the Education Department has been accused of underspending millions of rand meant to fill vacant posts.Teacher shortages is one of issues highlighted to have contributed to poor matric results.Last year, this also led to the closure of several schools in Port Elizabeth where parents demanded additional resources.Members of the Provincial Legislature (MPL) are currently conducting oversight visits where the issue of teacher shortages has been raised.Democratic Alliance MPL Edmund van Vuuren says that more than half of the schools had teacher vacancies over the last 12 months. The department has underspent the salary budget by a whooping R166 million. Now, where are this department s priorities? Teachers are not appointed, so they must give us reasons why there are no teachers in the classroom. The department has been unreachable for comment.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
