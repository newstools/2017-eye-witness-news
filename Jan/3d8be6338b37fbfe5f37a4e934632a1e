JOHANNESBURG The National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) has announced a strike at the University of South Africa (Unisa) in Pretoria, after salary increment negotiations crumbled at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration on Tuesday.Nehawu and Unisa had been in wage talks since last year, with the union demanding a 14% increase while the university offered 6%.However, the union says it has no choice but to call a strike after Unisa reduced its offer to 4.5%.The union's Khaya Xaba says Unisa has been misusing money and not prioritising their workers. They have been haemorrhaging money in the past two months; money that would have been used to fund the increment of workers has been used on that stupid library system software that they have installed. Also that R100 million which was spent on another software.
