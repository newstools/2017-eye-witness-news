VATICAN CITY, ROME - Pope Francis condemned militant Islamist violence as &quot;homicidal madness&quot; on Monday and said leaders should improve social conditions that serve as fertile ground for fundamentalism and radicalisation.Before diplomats from more than 180 countries, he also forcefully restated a call to ban nuclear weapons, saying experiments by North Korea to build long-range missiles risked setting off a new nuclear arms race.Francis, delivering the annual papal &quot;state of the world&quot; address, also spoke of the need to defend European unification and for greater unity in facing climate change.The Argentine-born pontiff, 80, reserved his toughest words of condemnation for the wave of &quot;fundamentalist-inspired terrorism&quot; in 2016, listing attacks by Islamist militants in Europe, Africa, Asia and the United States.&quot;Sadly, we are conscious that even today, religious experience, rather than fostering openness to others, can be used at times as a pretext for rejection, marginalisation and violence,&quot; he said in the Vatican's Sala Regia.&quot;We are dealing with a homicidal madness which misuses God's name in order to disseminate death, in a play for domination and power. Hence I appeal to all religious authorities to join in reaffirming unequivocally that one can never kill in God's name,&quot; he said.Francis said religiously inspired violence &quot;is the fruit of a profound spiritual poverty, and often is linked to significant social poverty. It can only be fully defeated with the joint contribution of religious and political leaders.&quot; He urged government leaders to enact &quot;suitable social policies aimed at combating poverty&quot; and invest in education and culture.Francis restated his call for a total nuclear weapons ban, saying North Korea's threats to test an intercontinental ballistic missile were &quot;particularly disturbing&quot;.He said they &quot;could destabilise the entire region and raise troubling questions for the entire international community about the risk of a new nuclear arms race.&quot;Francis called for an end to the arms trade, adding that easy access to weapons, &quot;even those of small calibre,&quot; aggravates conflicts and fosters insecurity and fear.VATICAN CITY, ROMEPope Francis condemned militant Islamist violence as &quot;homicidal madness&quot; on Monday and said leaders should improve social conditions that serve as fertile ground for fundamentalism and radicalisation.Before diplomats from more than 180 countries, he also forcefully restated a call to ban nuclear weapons, saying experiments by North Korea to build long-range missiles risked setting off a new nuclear arms race.Francis, delivering the annual papal &quot;state of the world&quot; address, also spoke of the need to defend European unification and for greater unity in facing climate change.The Argentine-born pontiff, 80, reserved his toughest words of condemnation for the wave of &quot;fundamentalist-inspired terrorism&quot; in 2016, listing attacks by Islamist militants in Europe, Africa, Asia and the United States.&quot;Sadly, we are conscious that even today, religious experience, rather than fostering openness to others, can be used at times as a pretext for rejection, marginalisation and violence,&quot; he said in the Vatican's Sala Regia.&quot;We are dealing with a homicidal madness which misuses God's name in order to disseminate death, in a play for domination and power.
