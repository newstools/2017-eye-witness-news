The National Assembly speaker has denied making any pronouncements on availing herself for president of the ruling party. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson Baleka Mbete has denied making any pronouncements on availing herself for president of the ruling party. The Sunday Times reported that Mbete apparently raised her hand for president of the ANC alongside Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and African Union Chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, when Jacob Zuma's term is expected to come to an end in December.Mbete says the ANC has not yet declared the succession debate open for discussion in the public and has refrained from answering questions on whether or not she is available to stand for president of the party.She says, The matter is not yet formally on the table. She has also raised concerns about the article in which she is said to have made herself available to stand for president.Mbete says the media must give the party space. We cannot have a discussion on air about a process that has not been sanctioned by the structures of the ANC, and personally I am just not happy with the way things are put in the newspapers.
