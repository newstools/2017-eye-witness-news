The former US president has spoken out about the the political activism which has erupted since Donald Trump was elected. WASHINGTON - Former US President Barack Obama is heartened by the political activism he sees across the country and disagrees with discrimination against people based on their religion, a spokesman said on Monday.Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for Obama, said the former president who left office 10 days ago &quot;fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.&quot;&quot;Citizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organise and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake,&quot; Lewis said. He said Obama was &quot;heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country.&quot;Last week new US President Donald Trump ordered a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily banning travellers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries. He said the move would help protect Americans from terrorism.
