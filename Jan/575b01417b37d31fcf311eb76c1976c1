Thousands of litres of water are lost daily as some residents in the WC ignore restrictions, and the City does not respond to a leaking meter in GP. CAPE TOWN Residents in one of the biggest water-guzzling areas in Cape Town say not enough people are doing their part to save water.The City of Cape Town has identified close to 20,000 households that use more than 1, 500 litres of water per day.The areas with the highest consumption rates include Constantia, Somerset West and Kraaifontein.It's not uncommon to find informal car washes, operated from someone's home, on different corners in the main roads in Wallacedene and Bloekombos, two townships in Kraaifontein.The City of Cape Town has approved level 3-B water restrictions in an effort to conserve water, which means people are not allowed to use hosepipes to wash cars.Locals say saving water is not a high priority with many Kraaifontein residents.The municipality says households with higher than average water consumption levels face hefty fines.Meanwhile, in Gauteng Parktown residents say a water metre has been leaking for over three days Residents say they have not received any assistance from the City of Johannesburg after numerous calls were made.They say they are more concerned about the thousands of consumable litres of water going to waste The City's Anthony still says it shouldn't take long to fix any spillage- and they will try get to the bottom of the matter.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
