The man who secured a murder conviction against Oscar Pistorius has explained his decision to join AfriForum. PRETORIA - Prosecutor Gerrie Nel says one of the major motivating factors which led to his resignation from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is the belief that everyone should be equal before the law.Lobby group Afriforum confirmed on Tuesday that Nel would from Wednesday lead its new private prosecuting unit.Nel rose to prominence after securing the fraud conviction of former national police commissioner Jackie Selebi and in recent years sent Paralympian Oscar Pistorius to prison for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.Nel says he did not make the decision to leave the prosecuting authority overnight.&quot;There's been consultation and conversation going back a year or more about my career and what I would want to do. &quot;But when I made the decision I decided to implement the decision. But it wasn't easy. I am a prosecutor at heart and I will always be a prosecutor.&quot;Nel says he is driven by a sense of justice.&quot;My main concern has always has been that everyone should be equal before the law. I've seen and read more and more perceptions that there might be selective prosecutions and if that is so, then I think it's absolutely brilliant to have an organisation that can just make sure that everybody is equal before the law.&quot;At Tuesday afternoon's announcement, AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel spelled out his vision for the private prosecutions unit. We will now go ahead to privately prosecute officials and politicians that are guilty of corruption, that are looting taxpayers money and that are not prosecuted by the NPA.
