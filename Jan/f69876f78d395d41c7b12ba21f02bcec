Absa could be liable to pay back more than R2 billion rand for an unlawful apartheid-era bailout. JOHANNESBURG - Barclays Africa says it's regrettable that the Public Protector's report into Absa was leaked before it was given an opportunity to explain its role in the debacle.The bank could be liable to pay back more than R2 billion rand for an unlawful apartheid-era bailout.Provisionally, the Public Protector has found that government breached the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act.Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago says that he's studying the report and has already found some irregularities.Advocate Paul Hoffman laid the complaint with then Public Protector Thuli Mandonsela in 2010.He says it's unfortunate that the report has been made public before those implicated were given time to deal with the allegations. Which she intends to do now and wasn t done in this case very clearly, is to give people who are potentially detrimentally affected an opportunity of dealing with the allegations against them by putting the allegations to them.
