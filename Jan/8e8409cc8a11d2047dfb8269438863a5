JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) president Jacob Zuma says he s not available to serve for a third term and that even if he were nominated, he wouldn t accept.The president was speaking during an interview aired on three Setswana medium South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) radio stations this evening.On Wednesday, he was on the public broadcaster s Nguni stations and referred to former president Thabo Mbeki s era, saying that at the time, he was one of the people against Mbeki seeking a third term.#Zuma says he is not available to run for the third term. CMZuma says he has no ambition to stand again and says that would create tensions in the party. You can t say the president of the ruling party and the president of the country must exist in parallel, because if that s the case you are creating two centres of power that could in a sense compete.
