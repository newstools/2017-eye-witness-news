CAPE TOWN - The Northern Cape town of Calvinia's dam has run dry.The Hantam Municipality is currently making use of seven boreholes to provide water to residents for household consumption.Water restrictions are in place to preserve the available underground water supply.The Karee Dam beneath the picturesque Hantam Mountains is completely dry, leaving residents in the area without fresh drinking water.Acting municipal manager Riaan van Wyk says that if the daily demand for water exceeds what is available, certain areas of the town might be left without drinking water for some time. Currently the supply of the boreholes is 55 kilolitres per hour. If we do not receive enough rain, the level of the boreholes will drop and so will the amount of water be limited per hour to the consumers. Neighbouring towns like Nieuwoudtville, Loeriesfontein and Brandvlei are also being assisted with water supplies.Residents are being urged to use water sparingly.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
