If you allow some protesters to burn down clinics and schools, you will not see a new primary school in your lifetime. Makhura says a number of schools will be built in this township and in others this year. This is not the last school we re building. There are still four more schools we re going to build in this area. Meanwhile, the Gauteng Education Department says despite over 30,000 children still without a school, the first day of the 2017 academic year went smoothly across the province.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
