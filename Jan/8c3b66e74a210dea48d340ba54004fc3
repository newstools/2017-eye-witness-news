Lobby group Afriforum has approached the High Court in Pretoria to interdict Eskom from cutting power to eight non-paying municipalities. PRETORIA It s emerged in court that Eskom s efforts to recover billions of rands in debt from eight non-paying municipalities stretches back as far as 2011. Lobby group Afriforum has approached the High Court in Pretoria to interdict Eskom from cutting power to the affected councils. The organisation has argued that law-abiding ratepayers should not be punished for the failure of their municipalities to pay Eskom for services. The towns in the Free State, North West and Northern Cape face being left in the dark from Thursday if their accounts are not settled. Judge Hans Fabricius says it s not correct for Afriforum to claim that Eskom decided, out of the blue over Christmas, to disconnect the power supply to the non-paying municipalities. He says the power utility has tried for several years to recover its debt, and has been engaged with various affected parties including the Treasury to resolve the issue. The judge further emphasised Eskom s obligation to recover money owed to it, and its role in the economy. Afriforum has re-iterated its argument that consumers shouldn t be punished for poor administration. The organisation says Eskom gave an undertaking not to cut power to municipalities until its main application challenging this practice is heard in March. It wants the cuts to be put on hold until then.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
