Storm, who has a single tour victory to his name at the French Open in 2007, sunk five birdies and has now gone 41 holes since last dropping a shot. JOHANNESBURG England's Graeme Storm carded a faultless 67 for a 17-under-par total and a three-shot lead over world number two Rory McIlroy following the third round of the European Tour s South African Open on Saturday.Jordan Smith (68) of England and home golfer Jbe Kruger (69) are a further shot back on 13 under par for the tournament.Storm, who has a single tour victory to his name at the French Open in 2007, sunk five birdies and has now gone 41 holes since last dropping a shot.McIlroy, who has been suffering with back pain this week, was left frustrated by another poor finish to his round of 67. After bogeying 17 and 18 on Friday, he dropped a shot again on the last in the third round.He turned in 33 after an eagle on the par-four seventh hole and looked to be on the charge having sunk three birdies in his next four.Yet the 27-year-old Northern Irishman missed an excellent birdie chance on the 15th hole and then could not sink a 20-foot putt on 18. He remains upbeat about his chances though. I m very pleased, McIlory told reporters. I was in a bit of discomfort early on but the physio got me out to play. I started well and drove the ball well. I gave myself plenty of chances and took a few of them in the middle of the round like I did yesterday. It was a decent score, but I felt it could have been better. The finish was disappointing, not birdying 15 and then dropping a shot on the way in, but I m still in with a shout tomorrow and that s all I can ask. Storm only retained his European Tour membership card for 2017 after American Patrick Reed was removed from the money-list last year, having not played in the required number of five tournaments.
