The AIC &amp; ANC met following threats by the AIC that if the process is not completed it will pull out of the coalition agreement. JOHANNESBURG The African Independent Congress (AIC) says it s in the process of drafting a memorandum of understanding with the African National Congress (ANC), to get the ruling party to agree on paper, that Matatiele will be reincorporated into KwaZulu-Natal before March this year.The parties met this week following threats by the AIC that if this process is not completed it will pull out of the coalition agreement and that would see the ANC loose the only metro it governs in Gauteng.The AIC, which was formed in protest against the demarcation of Matatiele into the Eastern Cape, went into coalition in Ekurhuleni with the ANC after last year s local government elections.AIC president Mandla Galo said, We are still busy with it because we want to ensure that by 15 March we have a memorandum of understating that is implemented immediately.
