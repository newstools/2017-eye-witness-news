The DA says they've agreed the party will now lodge a formal complaint against the ANC amid claims it was running a 'war room'. JOHANNESBURG - The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA) say they've agreed the party will now lodge a formal complaint against the African National Congress (ANC) amid claims it was running a war room which tried to send out fake tweets and re-tweets and created a false Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) poster.The commission and the DA met on Tuesday after other claims surfaced that IEC deputy chair Terry Tselane was being intimidated by the ANC.The ANC has denied it was involved in the 'war room' and said General Manager Ignatius Jacobs had to explain to Secretary General Gwede Mantashe what happened.The IEC says it s given the DA an undertaking that it will report the party s concerns to a full meeting of its commission and that it will deliberate on the issue.DA leader Mmusi Maimane has described Tuesday s meeting as &quot;robust and fruitful&quot;.Maimane s spokesperson Mabine Seabe says, The IEC stated that they re aware of the issue and invited our leader [Maimane] to submit a formal complaint, which will activate an investigation on their side. The DA says it will submit the complaint in the next few days.News surrounding the ANC war room first came to light when PR company owner Sihle Bolani sued the ANC for over R2 million, saying she worked for the party's covert unit.Shaka Sisulu was later linked to the alleged unit, a claim he described as inherently false and exaggerated .It was reported that Sisulu had spearheaded the covert unit aimed at discrediting opposition parties. Sisulu said he was troubled by the allegations revealed in court papers, but is certain he could dispel them if he were to represent himself in the matter.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
