The province performed poorly for a second year with a 59% pass rate, which was an improvement from last year's 56%. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Students (Cosas) says while it s disappointed with the poor performance of Eastern Cape schools in the 2016 matric results, it s calling on the Education Department there to learn from the Free State.The province performed poorly for a second year with a 59% pass rate, an improvement from last year's 56%.Over 36,000 matric pupils in the Eastern Cape failed their grade 12 exams.Cosas is also encouraging pupils who didn t pass, to go to their schools and re-do the grade with confidence and full commitment.Cosas President Zama Khanyase says: As an organisation, we re saying they re still young and it s not the end of the world. They must go back to school and repeat grade 12. We must welcome the initiative which has been there for quite a while now; to say that those who did not pass grade 12 or have certain subjects that they want to re-do are given a chance to do so.
