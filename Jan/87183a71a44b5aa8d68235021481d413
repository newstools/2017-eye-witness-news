ANC stalwarts say choosing a preferred candidate is not more important than the values and principles the candidate should possess. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts say while members of the ANC must have the final say on who should lead the organisation, an urgent discussion is needed around the values and principles the potential leaders must be seen to embody before members pronounce on their preferred candidates. The group of stalwarts have announced they will meet with the ANC's top six next week to discuss the modalities of the consultative conference, which will assess the state of the organisation.The veterans have raised concerns about the state of the organisation under President Jacob Zuma and say they hope the conference will lead to the rebuilding and renewal of the ANC.With the ANC Women s League having already pronounced on who they want to succeed President Jacob Zuma, the party's stalwarts say that choosing a preferred candidate is not more important than the values and principles the candidate should possess.ANC stalwart Sydney Mufamadi says: But the starting point is discussion, as we were saying with the principles and the values that these people must be seen to be an embodiment of. There is more at stake than just deciding who should be the president of this organisation. The stalwarts say they hope to calm the tensions over who should become the next president.(Edited by Neo Koza)
