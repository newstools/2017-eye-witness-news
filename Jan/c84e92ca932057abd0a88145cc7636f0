There are reports of recordings of a meeting between the ANC's Ignatius Jacobs and others allegedly involved in a covert unit. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe has declined to comment on whether the party will take action against its general manager Ignatius Jacobs, adding that the issue was not even discussed at the party's last NEC lekgotla.Mantashe was briefing the media at Luthuli House on Monday following the party s NEC lekgotla.It emerged in court papers last week that PR company owner Sihle Bolani is suing the ANC for over R2 million, saying she worked for the party s covert unit which was allegedly formed to discredit the opposition.The City Press reported on Sunday about recordings of a meeting between the ANC general manager and others allegedly involved in the plan.Last week Mantashe confirmed that Jacobs reports to him and suggested the general manager committed to paying nearly R1 million to Bolani and facilitated a payment of R100,000 without his knowledge.At the time he said the party was meeting with Jacobs and dealing with the issue. When asked if the party would take action against him, Mantashe said, We are dealing with that issue internally. That should be sufficient and if there are any developments in that process that we feel we must announce, we will announce it. I think you should accept that, otherwise you re expecting the ANC to conduct its internal discipline in media briefings. He said this was not an NEC issue but a management issue and they were dealing with it.#ANC WATCH Mantashe appeals for &quot;space&quot; to deal with #WarRoom allegation. CM pic.twitter.com/SrnOP4VWxY
