Patricia De Lille on Monday morning announced her resignation as provincial party leader which takes effect on Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - Opposition parties in the Western Cape claim Democratic Alliance (DA) provincial leader Patricia De Lille was kicked out of the position because of her ambitions to become premier.On Monday morning De Lille announced her resignation as provincial party leader, with effect from Wednesday.De Lille says increasing demands on her as Cape Town Mayor prompted her to resign as DA provincial leader.She says the municipality is taking a new direction in addressing inequality through improved service delivery.African National Congress provincial spokesperson Jabu Mfusi says De Lille resigned because she was forced to do so by provincial party structures. You ve got all those tensions emanating within the DA and old guys who want to come back. Economic Freedom Fighters provincial chairperson Bernard Joseph says De Lille s departure is a sign of in-fighting in the DA.The African Christian Democratic Party s Grant Hashkin says De Lille s ambitions to become premier led to the move. She s been gunning for premier of the Western Cape for the last couple of years and this is basically a victory for the DA old guard over an ID takeover. But DA leader Mmusi Maimane says De Lille's decision is in the best interest of the City of Cape Town. Maimane insists De Lille has not been forced to resign. There s no validity to their argument, there s no truth, there s no basis and in fact it is quite disarming when you say to a black South African who is a leader in government - and we want her to focus on other government departments - that it is suddenly seen as a demotion. I&#39;ve resigned as @Our_DA Western Cape leader. Thank you to all DA leaders, staff, activists and volunteers. My resignation letter: pic.twitter.com/arNYfwgj03
