The ANC&#8217;s Zizi Kodwa says there is no chance that what came up last year can be brought up in this week's NEC meeting. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) says its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting this week will only discuss its 8th January statement and will not discuss last year s motion to ask President Jacob Zuma to step down as president.The meeting is scheduled to start on Thursday and party heavyweights will discuss its plans for the year ahead to be presented at the mass rally on Sunday.At the last NEC meeting in December, several members of the committee tried to present a motion that Zuma be removed from office.The ANC s Zizi Kodwa says there is no chance that what came up last year can be brought up in Thursday's NEC meeting. Not at all, this NEC has only one thing on the agenda, and that s the January 8 statement. And he says a special NEC team has already been drawing up the statement. They will then present that draft to the entire National Executive Committee because it is the statement of the national executive committee which is presented by the president on behalf of the NEC. Last year, Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom was supported by several other ministers when they said Zuma should step down but in the end, the NEC resolved not to hold a vote on the issue.ANC TO FIGHT CORRUPTIONThe ANC said it will fight corruption within the party, and will seek to unite members from factions.This is ahead of its 105th anniversary celebrations in Soweto this weekend.Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said members within the ANC are tasked with reporting corruption and should not let it be the root of blackmail.He was speaking to residents at Mafatsana in Evaton after a door-to-door visit in the area.Some of the residents have questioned the party leadership at the Mafatsana Hall about the corruption levels within government, including officials deployed by the ANC.Mantashe replied by urging them to report corruption wherever it may be suspected, including when high-ranking politicians are involved.The party is set to hold its 105th year anniversary celebrations in Soweto on Sunday, and these engagements are part of gathering their support under the theme unity in action .Provincial executive committee member Panyaza Lesufi and national executive committee member Aaron Motsoaledi also took part in the door-to-door visits.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
