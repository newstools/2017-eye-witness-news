Adv Thuli Madonsela says it would not be in President Jacob Zuma's best interests to select the commissioner to lead an inquiry. CAPE TOWN Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela says that if President Jacob Zuma does not order a commission of inquiry into state capture, it will widen the trust deficit in South Africa.Madonsela made the recommendation as part of her investigation. Speaking at the Cape Town Press Club on Monday, she said that a transparent and open process was needed to get to the bottom of the claims.The former public protector says that the allegations around state capture, cannot be left untested. It's such a divisive matter, this state capture, there's so much mistrust attached to it. Madonsela says it has to be determined whether those who made the allegations, are telling the truth. If these people are lying, there should be consequences. No family alone can be controlling power and state resources. She says it would not be in the president s best interests to select the commissioner to lead an inquiry.But that without such a probe, the country would never know the truth.
