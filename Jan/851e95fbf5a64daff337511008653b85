Ho&#235;rskool Montana and Ho&#235;rskool Overkruin have resisted the department&#8217;s instruction to take in more pupils. PRETORIA - Two Afrikaans high schools in Pretoria have approached the courts to interdict the Gauteng Education Department from placing additional English-speaking pupils in their schools. Ho rskool Montana and Ho rskool Overkruin argue that they have limited capacity to accommodate English-speaking pupils and have resisted the department s instruction to take in more pupils.At least 40,000 pupils across the province have yet to be placed in schools as the first day of the academic year started on Wednesday morning. Legal counsel for Ho rskool Overkruin and Ho rskool Montana say the matter is not about language policy but a question of capacity.The court heard that the two predominantly Afrikaans schools have since the year 2000 each accommodated one class of English-speaking pupils while an English school was being built in the area. The schools say that despite the English-speaking school being completed and having space, the department instructed them in December to make space for four additional English classes.They argue that they are filled to capacity and simply don t have the infrastructure or teaching resources to accommodate more pupils. The department has challenged the urgency of the matter saying the schools knew since July last year that the pupils had to be accommodated, and did nothing about it until now.(Edited by Neo Koza)
