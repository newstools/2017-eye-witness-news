With a recent win under the belt at Leopard Creek at the end of 2016, Stone says he's keen to retain his good form. JOHANNESBURG - Brandon Stone says he is excited to return to Glendower as the 2016 defending SA Open Championship.The tournament tees off on Thursday in Johannesburg with excitement around the inclusion of Rory McIlroy on the bill.Stone says that he is keen to be back. &quot;This is only the second time I've been back to Glendower since the SA Open last year, so obviously there are a lot of memories flooding through the system which is quite enjoyable. It's always been a place I've enjoyed going to and played well at so hopefully I can try and replicate last year's result this year.&quot;With a recent win under the belt at Leopard Creek at the end of 2016, Stone says he's keen to retain his good form. &quot;Yesterday's round got a bit of the December rust off. I wasn't planning on firing on all cylinders. The game felt good but you never really know after a long December break. A 61 doesn't hurt the confidence coming back from Leopard Creek considering I've only played four rounds of golf since then. I got some rust off yesterday, a nice Pro AM today, so will build on it from there.&quot;Following a breakout year in 2016, Stone says he's keeping his feet on the ground: &quot;I m still the same person I've always been. Practice round on Monday, you get the same butterflies and emotions coming out again. It was very special.&quot;
