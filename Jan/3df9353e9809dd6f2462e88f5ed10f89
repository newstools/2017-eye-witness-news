However Minister Malusi Gigaba says business may trigger tensions in communities when they overlook competent South Africans for jobs. JOHANNESBURG Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba says government does not aim to hinder migration to South Africa, but has urged business to ensure that 60% of its staff are South African.Gigaba has held a media briefing in Pretoria giving feedback on the department's work as well the process for special permits for Lesotho nationals.The minister emphasized the role foreign nationals play in the country and its economy, adding that South Africa benefits from their stay.He says migration is a natural phenomenon which he welcomes but adds that business may trigger tensions in communities when they overlook competent South Africans for jobs. Business visas carry the condition that 60% of the business staff compliment must be South African, and yet many citizens and labour stakeholders and sister departments are concerned that many businesses do not want to hire South African workers. Minister Gigaba says this perception has led to the belief that many business exploit migrant workers to lower wages and conditions.He says the department will meet with business to discuss this and ensure inspections of business that may not be adhering to the 60% policy.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
