The social development minister&#8217;s spokesperson Lumka Olifant says she&#8217;s fed up with people accusing Dlamini of being an alcoholic. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress Women s League (ANCWL) says it believes its President Bathabile Dlamini is being targeted following reports of her being drunk at official events.In a Facebook post, the social development minister s spokesperson Lumka Olifant says she s fed up with people accusing Dlamini of being an alcoholic. Oliphant says Dlamini does not drink alcohol under any circumstances. She also used swear words in her post to hit back at Dlamini's detractors. While the Women s League agrees that Dlamini does not drink alcohol it says it cannot condone Olifant s use of language.The league's spokesperson Toko Xasa says, We d not have encouraged by any means such language. We hope the president will deal with it from the office. Xasa says it s not the first time such reports have emerged. It s so unfortunate because we re looking at these events as they unfold as undermining the president of the ANCWL. As a woman, we look at it as being targeted. Xasa says while Olifant is correct in denying the alcohol abuse reports, she should not have lashed out in the manner she did. We would not have encouraged, by any means, such language. We hope the president will also deal with that from the office because by all means we expect people to communicate in a language in line with how society has to hear your message.
