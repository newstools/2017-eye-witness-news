Political analysts are questioning whether President Jacob Zuma was the right person to deliver the ANC&#8217;s 2017 message. CAPE TOWN - Political analysts say the African National Congress (ANC)'s January 8 statement hit all the right buttons in calling for an end to destructive factionalism and corruption, but they re questioning whether President Jacob Zuma was the right person to deliver the message.Zuma delivered the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC)'s statement to a packed Orlando stadium in Soweto on Sunday.It acknowledges that the party has made mistakes and promises to correct them.The statement calls for unity and an end to damaging infighting so that the ANC can deliver on its promises of radical economic transformation and the return of the land to its people.Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says, The messages are good, no doubt about it. The question is whether the messengers are really genuine in delivering this message, are they the right people to actually deliver the message, particularly President Jacob Zuma? Is he going to be part of the solution, or is he the biggest problem? Commentator Ebrahim Fakir says, It always has been the case with Jacob Zuma, the right message from the wrong person. Fakir says the statement reflects something of a compromise between the pro and anti-Zuma factions in the ANC s NEC. The ANC will elect a new leader in December.[WATCH] ANC fills up Orlando Stadium for 105th anniversary(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
