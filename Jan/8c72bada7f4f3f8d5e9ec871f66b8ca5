CAPE TOWN - Firefighters say dense cloud cover is hampering efforts to extinguish a fire near Grabouw in the Overberg.Additional crews are on standby to assist in operations high on the mountain slopes.Officials say the blaze reignited on Tuesday following an arson attack last week.Overberg fire commander Reinhard Geldenhys says that despite cooler temperatures and low winds, dense cloud cover has limited operations. The wind is not hampering efforts, it s nice and cool up there so the guys are making good progress. But the flipside of that coin is we can t get out helicopters in because the cloud base is too low. Officials are working tirelessly to contain the blaze and prevent it spreading to the nearby Nederberg nature reserve.At the same time, some crews working on the Helderberg wildfire will stand down on Thursday as the fire has abated somewhat.The fire, which broke out on Tuesday, has already damaged or destroyed several structures and has ravaged farm land.
