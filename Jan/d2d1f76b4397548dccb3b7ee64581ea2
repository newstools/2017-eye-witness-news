The New Era College, along with Giyani High School, was implicated in the leaked mathematics paper two question. JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Thohoyandou is expected to hear a case involving a school and the Basic Education Department regarding the release of matric results.The New Era College, along with Giyani High School, was implicated in the leaked mathematics paper two question.But it lodged an urgent interdict for the department to release the results of its candidates, except for the mathematics paper.The department has blocked the results of all subjects of selected candidates, saying it will release them after their investigation is complete.School governing body spokesperson Matimba Ndlovu says the department is unfair by blocking the results of all subjects, while the issue is with mathematics. We decided as parents it was unfair of the department to withhold the results of not only maths. This acts as a punishment on our children before they have even been found guilty of wrongdoing.
