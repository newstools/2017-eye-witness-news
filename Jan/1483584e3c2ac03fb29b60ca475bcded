The party's provincial executive committee briefed the media on Monday on the outcome of Friday s meeting on several issues including the ongoing national leadership race.The provincial executive council spoke of a history in which prosecutorial decisions a decade ago were used in an ANC election year.Acting provincial chairperson Khaya Magaxa highlights the charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. We condemn the politicisation of law enforcement agencies.
