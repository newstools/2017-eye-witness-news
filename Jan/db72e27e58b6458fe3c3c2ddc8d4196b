The Tshwane mayor discussed his recent Taiwan trip at a briefing in Centurion on Wednesday. JOHANNESBURG Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga says he s gone to great lengths to explain that his recent Taiwan trip was purely about business and not politics, even writing to the Chinese embassy to allay their concerns. Msimanga discussed the trip at a briefing in Centurion on Wednesday. The mayor has been heavily criticised by the department as well as the African National Congress (ANC) for allegedly breaching the government s 'one China' policy which doesn t recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state. Msimanga says he has written to the International Relations Department to discuss his Taiwan trip. So I did say to them that I m more than happy to come and engage with them. I ve even gone further, writing to the Chinese embassy to explain what my trip was all about, and also to say to them that if anybody is unclear of what I went to Taipei to go and do, I m more than happy to engage with them. Msimanga says his main goal was to lure investigators to Tshwane but this controversy has made some of them nervous. He says those turning the trip into a political football are doing a disservice to the country.The mayor came under fire from the Department of International Relations and the ANC for allegedly breaching government s 'one China policy'.Msimanga says he was invited by the mayor of Taipei. This has got nothing to do with the one China policy . It has everything to do with a city to city visit and us learning how administration in another city seems to run and might I say, a world class city. He says the International Relations Department was briefed about the intended trip when he received the invitation and initially gave its blessing.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
