Muthambi's conduct as the minister responsible for overseeing the SABC came under scrutiny in Parliament. PARLIAMENT - Several opposition parties in Parliament have called for Communications Minister Faith Muthambi to be fired. While African National Congress (ANC) MPs have also been highly critical of Muthambi's role in the decline of the public broadcaster, they re not singing from the same song sheet just yet.Muthambi's conduct as the minister responsible for overseeing the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) came under scrutiny during deliberations on the inquiry's draft report on Friday.Those saying President Jacob Zuma must sack Muthambi include the Democratic Alliance (DA), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), National Freedom Party (NFP) and African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP).The EFF s Fana Mokoena says, Given the fact that she failed to reign in the board, to run the SABC proficiently, given the fact that the SABC deteriorated under her watch, given the discrepancies that we picked up in her evidence, I think it s clear that she s not fit to hold the office of shareholder. The concrete, cogent recommendation that we must make to the president is that she must be fired. The DA says Muthambi s interference violated the constitution, the Broadcast Act and the Executive Members Ethics Act. ANC MPs have expressed concern over Muthambi s undue influence , but unless the call for her head is adopted by the committee as a whole, it s not yet a formal position.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
