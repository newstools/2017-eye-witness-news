CAPE TOWN Public hearings on government s controversial plan to introduce a so-called sugar tax on sweetened beverages are set to start in Parliament at the end of the month.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan ruffled feathers in his Budget speech last year when he announced a sugar tax would be implemented by 1 April.While the industry says the tax would result in job losses, the health sector believes there are benefits for all South Africans.Parliament s standing committee on finance, in conjunction with its health committee, has invited submissions on the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages before 27 January, after which public hearings will follow. The committee s chairman Yunus Carrim says while the committee has not yet discussed the matter, it is well-aware of the arguments on both sides. We are not experts, so we want to hear both sides and write a report for the parliamentary committees to consider and for the executive, the Minister of Finance in particular, to take into account. The South African Sugar Association (Sasa) says it s already in crisis after three years of drought, and is standing by its position that a sugar tax would be detrimental to the industry. Sasa s vice chairman Suresh Naidoo says the health benefits of a sugar tax have also not been proven. We are already on our knees as an industry based in the deep rural areas where there are no other job opportunities. This tax is just going to exacerbate that situation. Carrim says a report will be submitted to National Treasury to consider before a final decision to introduce a sugar tax is taken.
