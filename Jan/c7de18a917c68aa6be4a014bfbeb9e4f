The union says that the matric results are proof that the DA is wrong for saying that its members are destroying South Africa&#8217;s education system. JOHANNESBURG The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) criticised the Democratic Alliance (DA) for saying that its members are destroying South Africa s education system.It has congratulated teachers for the work they put into the 2016 matric results.Sadtu s Mugwena Maluleke says its teachers have achieved results under trying times and should be praised for this.He says that although there is still a lot of work to be done on the system, it is clear that teachers are doing something right. The DA has, through its mouthpiece, indicated that the matric results are a disaster. What we have seen yesterday and what we understand as standardisation is dispelling these particular lies that are being peddled by the DA for political reasons.
