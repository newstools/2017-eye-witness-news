Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu has requested more time to study the findings and respond. JOHANNESBURG The Health Ombudsman says the report into the deaths of psychiatrist patients from the Life Healthcare Esidimeni facility will not be released this Wednesday as initially planned as Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu has requested more time to study the findings and respond.Last month, Professor Malegapuru Makgoba confirmed the death toll had risen to at least 39.The patients died last year after being transferred from Esidimeni to various NGOs around Gauteng when the health department terminated its contract with the facility.Health MEC spokesperson Steve Mabona says Mahlangu needs to go through the report. [It is] a more than 100-page report. One can t just quickly scan through it and then respond. On that basis, the MEC will agree or disagree if it will be released. But the Democratic Alliance (DA) s Jack Bloom says the MEC is simply trying to delay the release. I am disappointed but not surprised because MEC Qedani Mhlangu has been delaying this.
