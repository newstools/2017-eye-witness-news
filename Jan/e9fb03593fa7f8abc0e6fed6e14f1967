The ANC has been furious at Solly Msimanga for the trip, claiming he has tried to undermine national government&#8217;s decision to only recognise China and not Taiwan. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA)-led administration in Tshwane says the trip by its mayor Solly Msimanga to Taiwan does not mean the party would decide to no longer diplomatically recognise China and recognise Taiwan if it were to win the next elections.The African National Congress (ANC) has strongly criticised Msimanga for making the trip, saying that national government has a policy of only recognising China and city administrations should not try to undermine the policy.The ANC has been furious at Msimanga for this trip, claiming he has tried to undermine national government s decision to only recognise China and not Taiwan.But the acting mayor of Tshwane Cilliers Brink says this is not an indication of the DA s foreign policy as a whole. As a trade visit by a city, we re certainly not making a major foreign policy announcement, we re simply acting in the interests of the residents who elected us. China refuses to trade with countries that diplomatically recognise Taiwan.The ANC took the decision to cut ties with Taiwan and recognise China in 1996 after strong pressure from Beijing.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
