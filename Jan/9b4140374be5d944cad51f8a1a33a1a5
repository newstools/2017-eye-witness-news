JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department says it doesn t know when it will pay teachers who marked the 2016 matric papers last month.The department says it s so far only paid R81 million of the R581 million balance and is still waiting for approval for funding from Treasury.Some teachers say they ve only received about half of what s owed to them while others haven t been paid at all.Department spokesperson Oupa Bodibe says the delay in payment has been brought about by the unforeseen higher number of teachers that raised the expenses this year. There were more teachers than we d anticipated because the number of learners have gone up. We didn t have sufficient funds to pay them. One teacher says that the non-payment has severely inconvenienced her and her colleagues. The problem is people budgeted for this money. They have children who have to go to universities. They went on holiday and they have debts. Despite the remarking phase expected to take place this coming weekend, a WhatsApp message is being circulated among educators informing them of a looming strike this Friday.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
