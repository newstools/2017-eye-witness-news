Madonsela said that during her time as Public Protector, reports into matters still under investigation were not released electronically to safeguard against leaks. CAPE TOWN Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela won't say whether the leaked provisional report on Absa is the same one she had been compiling before leaving office.Speaking to the Cape Town Press Club on Monday, Madonsela said that during her time as Public Protector, reports into matters still under investigation were not released electronically to safeguard against leaks.She has told the Press Club she personally started investigating an alleged pre-apartheid bail out to Absa bank.But there were many legal hoops to jump through, delaying the probe. The fact that it took longer, doesn't mean it was less important. The horse had already bolted. It was about what information we could collect. Madonsela says only an administrative error had prevented her from signing off on her provisional report, before she left office last October.She would not say whether the remedial action in the leaked report, that Absa repay R2 billion to state coffers, was hers.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
