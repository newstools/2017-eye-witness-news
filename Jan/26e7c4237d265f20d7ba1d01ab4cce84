FNB's Randburg branch was robbed of apparently over 300 safety deposit boxes, while nearly R2m &amp; 30 boxes were stolen in Parktown. JOHANNESBURG First National Bank (FNB) says it has deployed additional resources to assist law enforcement authorities in their investigation of heists that took place at two of its branches.In December, the bank's Randburg branch was robbed of apparently over 300 safety deposit boxes, while nearly R2 million was stolen along with 30 boxes in Parktown.FNB says it cannot divulge the details of the burglary, including how long the security guard was held hostage and whether an alarm went off to notify the bank of suspicious activity.The bank says police are in the process of interviewing potential suspects linked to the Parktown heist.Earlier, authorities said they could not rule out the possibility of a gang being responsible for the heists, which used a similar modus operandi of drilling through a wall to access the vaults.A Randburg FNB customer says there has been no talk of compensation at this stage. We believe, even the staff believes, there was inadequate security for those boxes. The bank says it cannot release information on the type of security measures it takes, after questions were raised about how much time the robbers had to complete their crime and why there seemed to be only one security guard on duty during both heists.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
