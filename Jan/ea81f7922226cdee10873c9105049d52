Samwu says the announcement by Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba is insensitive. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) has condemned the announcement of the planned arrests of 106 licensing centre officials, calling it sensationalist.Samwu says that the announcement by Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba is insensitive as there will be implications for targeted officials who are innocent.Mashaba announced this week that the city has identified more than a hundred corrupt licensing centre officials who ll soon be handcuffed.Samwu labour relations specialist Jack Mokalapa says Mashaba's is celebrating without being aware of the damage to reputation his announcement may cause. Even giving the public the impression that they caught them (corrupt licensing centre officials), they re in an unnecessary celebratory mood. Mokalapa says while they support the fight against corruption, Mashaba should not use a labour issue to score political points. We have labour relations, which are sensitive. We operate in a political contest. Don t use these things which can be easily resolved in disciplinary hearings to score political points. Mokalapa also criticised the recent arrest of eight officials who are Samwu members, saying that due process was neglected.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
