Residents are requesting the municipality provide them with accommodation close to the Woodstock or Salt River areas. CAPE TOWN - A group of Woodstock residents who could be evicted from their Bromwell Street homes is facing a tough legal battle for alternative accommodation near Cape Town s CBD.Twenty-six residents filed an urgent application last year requesting the Western Cape High Court to rule the City of Cape Town has a constitutional responsibility to provide them with reasonable alternative accommodation. #BromwellStreet Mugardie says there are a number of parcels of land suitable for affordable housing to be built on for residents. MMSheldon Mugardie, the lawyer representing the residents, has requested the court visit Wolwerivier, a so-called temporary relocation area near Atlantis where the City of Cape Town has offered accommodation to residents who are not eligible for social housing.Mugardie says the inspection will shed light on problematic issues like the long distance between Wolwerivier and the Cape Town CBD where most residents work and go to school.#BromwellStreet Weinkoue: &quot;People travel everyday from further distances (like Somerset West and Strand) to town for work.&quot; MMResidents are requesting the municipality provide them with accommodation close to the Woodstock or Salt River areas.But City of Cape Town s lawyer Karrisha Pillay has argued Wolwerivier is a suitable area.Pillay argues an inspection is unnecessary as the conditions in Wolwerivier are irrelevant to the relief sought by the applicants.She adds Wolwerivier is the closest area to place residents seeking emergency accommodation.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
