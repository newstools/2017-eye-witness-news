A group of parents at Sandown High in Sandton say they have been queuing for over 6 hours waiting to be assisted by management. JOHANNESBURG - Dissatisfied parents have gathered at Sandown High School in Sandton saying they were told by the Education Department to go to the school to confirm their children's registration. They say management has not assisted them despite being there since 6am.The provincial Education Department insisted last year that children be registered online for Grade 1 and Grade 8.Many parents across the province are battling to get their children into schools but the department says it s all systems go for tomorrow.A group of parents at the Sandown High School say they've been sent from one place to another when trying to make sure their children are placed in a school. I was told that I have to make it online. I just relocated from Vryburg in the North West with the idea and the thinking that when you relocate, not automatically but obviously they will consider some things and you will be helped. Another parent says he has relocated from Cape Town and was told not to apply online as the department would deal specifically with parents who have relocated. We were told in Cape Town that we didn t have to register because we would come here and obviously get some form of preference as we are a relocation matter. The department has confirmed that a total of 58,000 children still need to be placed, saying that many have come from other provinces over the past few months.(Edited by Neo Koza)
