Law expert Paul Hoffman says there is seemingly no commissioner who goes into office and leaves with their reputation intact. JOHANNESBURG Questions are now raised regarding alleged cadre deployment at the national police commissioner's office.Law expert Paul Hoffman says there is seemingly no commissioner who goes into office and leaves with their reputation intact.Hoffman says signs of cadre deployment go back to the times of former commissioner Jackie Selebi, who was found guilty of corruption, then Bheki Cele who lost his job for signing off new police buildings worth millions improperly, all the way down to Riah Phiyega who has been found unfit to hold office by a commission of inquiry. Riah Phiyega has no background in the police. She just parachuted in to replace Bheki Cele. The law expert says even though Phiyega is now challenging the Claasen Inquiry's judgement the odds are she will suffer the same fate.She was heavily criticised for the decision to use tactical force to try end the strike in Marikana in 2012 which left 34 minors dead.The suspended commissioner has now filed papers in the High Court in Pretoria arguing that the inquiry is in contradiction to the Falam Inquiry into the Marikana massacre.At the same time, acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane is also in the hot seat with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate probing allegations of corruption
