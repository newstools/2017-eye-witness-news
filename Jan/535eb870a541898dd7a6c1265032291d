We mustn t just assume that people are drinking because they re poor or whatever. Emergency centre head Sister Madenia Hoosain says they have seen tangible proof of the programme's success. There was one patient last week who said thank you to the counsellors, because he almost lost his job, and now because he s got proof that he s getting counselling the boss said Oh but it s fine. I was going to retrench you, but I ll give you another chance. By the end of November 735 people had already been screened.#HeideveldDayClinic Mbombo checking on the Teachable Moments Programme, which is still in its pilot phase at 3 state clinics in the WC.
