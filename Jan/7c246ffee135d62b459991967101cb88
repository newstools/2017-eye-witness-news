According to the &quot;One China&quot; policy, people seeking diplomatic ties with mainland China cannot have relations with Taiwan.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said: &quot;This flies in the face of an organisation that always prides itself on being the champion of democracy and the Constitution. Clearly his action undermines the Constitution.&quot;There was already backlash when Msimanga left for China, however he still chose to honour Taiwanese Mayor Ko Wen-je's invitation, saying that it was in the best interests of the country to explore any and all investment potential.(Edited by Zunaid Ismael)
