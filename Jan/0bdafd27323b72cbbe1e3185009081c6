The civil rights group is seeking to interdict Eskom from cutting power supply to eight municipalities. PRETORIA - Lobby group Afriforum says law-abiding ratepayers should not be punished for the failures of their poorly managed municipalities.This is among the arguments submitted in the High Court in Pretoria where the group is seeking to interdict Eskom from cutting power supply to eight municipalities.The matter has however been postponed until Wednesday to allow the judge more time to read the court papers.Afriforum s Willie Spies says Eskom should use other legal measures to recover debt from municipalities. We represent law-abiding citizens, rate-paying citizens and a whole range of residents of the municipalities are going to suffer irreparable harm if they are being punished for the wrongs of their municipal administrations. In March the court will hear a full application to have Eskom s practice of cutting power to entire municipalities declared unconstitutional. This urgent matter will be heard on Wednesday, just one day before Eskom intends cutting the power supply to towns in the Free State, North West and Northern Cape.(Edited by Neo Koza)
