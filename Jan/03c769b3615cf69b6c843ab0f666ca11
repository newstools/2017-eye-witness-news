Early on Monday, he said in a telephone interview with the New York Times: &quot;People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing.&quot;Streep was referring to a 2015 incident at a South Carolina rally where Trump flailed his arms and slurred in his speech in apparent ridicule of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a physical disability.In his Twitter comments, Trump repeated his denial that he had mocked the reporter.Streep, without naming Trump, used almost the entire speech when accepting the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award to criticise the real estate mogul's behaviour and policies, while calling for Hollywood to stand strong against any attacks and to support a free press.
