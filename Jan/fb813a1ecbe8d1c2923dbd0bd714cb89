The Justice Minister briefed Parliament's portfolio committee on a bill that will give effect to Cabinet's decision to pull out of the ICC. PARLIAMENT - Justice Minister Michael Masutha says it s up to Parliament to decide whether or not to ratify Cabinet's decision to withdraw South Africa from the International Criminal Court (ICC), in spite of legal action aimed at halting the country's exit.Masutha was briefing Parliament's portfolio committee on a bill that will give effect to Cabinet's decision to pull out.The Supreme Court of Appeal found government was in breach of the act by failing to arrest Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir when he visited South Africa for the African Union summit in June 2015.The Democratic Alliance (DA) and other organisations, including the Helen Suzman Foundation, have since challenged SA's decision to withdraw.Judgment in the DA s court bid to halt the process of withdrawing South Africa from the ICC has yet to be handed down.But Masutha says that should not stop Parliament from considering the bill repealing South Africa s obligations as a member of the ICC. That matter has been heard and we re all awaiting judgment. This committee, or this Parliament, is not under any interdict from that court or any other court from proceeding on matters before it. MPs are sharply divided along political lines over the issue, with Congress of the People (COPE), the DA and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) all arguing against the merits of South Africa s withdrawal.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
