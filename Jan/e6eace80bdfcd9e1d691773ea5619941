At the centre of that radical transformation is the land question, which we are debating in the party. We're looking at our policies that we've passed in the last twenty years. And what we need to do to bring about fundamental change to accelerate the program of land. Mbalula also threw his weight behind the controversial debate around an apartheid-era bailout of BANKorp that Absa later bought. We are going to accelerate the program of ensuring that ABSA repays what belongs to the people of South Africa.

The minister has called on members to stop worrying about individuals in the party and instead focus on reviewing policies.
