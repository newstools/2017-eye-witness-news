Two suicide bombers who carried out a 13 January attack in Madagali had babies strapped to their backs. PRETORIA - Female suicide bombers in Nigeria are blowing themselves up while carrying babies to avoid detection.Authorities have warned that the sick tactic could become a 'dangerous' trend among terrorists after nine people died in a blast earlier this month.Two of the suicide bombers who carried out a 13 January attack in Madagali had babies strapped to their backs.The women apparently passed a vigilante checkpoint and were mistaken for civilians because they were carrying infants.Two other women who were not carrying infants were stopped at the checkpoint.Boko Haram, a Jihadist militant group that has ravaged Nigeria, is suspected to have carried out the bombing.The group has killed 15,000 people and displaced more than two million others during a seven-year insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in the north of Nigeria.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
