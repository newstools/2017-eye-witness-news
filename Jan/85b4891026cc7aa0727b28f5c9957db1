DAVOS - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan says he believes Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane owes him an explanation as to how her provisional report on Absa was leaked.The report says she s found the group owes government over R2 billion because of loans the apartheid government gave to banks that were then incorporated into Absa.Absa, the Reserve Bank and the Reserve Bank s governor at the time Chris Stals have all said Mkhwebane s findings are wrong and that she s misunderstood certain information.Gordhan says he s not happy that this report was leaked. Leaks are not good and so the Public Protector still owes us an explanation as to why a provisional report, where there might be factual or other errors, finds its way into the media. And he says people have a right to know what the actual facts are. On the one hand we want to open this and on the other we want to open this on proven facts and in any legal system, the important part to hear the other side, then evaluate the facts and then decide what is the right thing to do. Gordhan also says he s found it much easier to sell South Africa to investors than it was this time last year.WATCH: Absa report: Gordhan says Public Protector owes explanation(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
