                                         CAPE TOWN - Ocean View community members say there has been an intensified police presence over the long weekend. Last week, residents demonstrated against a lack of policing and a failure to curb gangsterism. A community leader has told Eyewitness News that at least 20 people have been shot dead due to gang violence since the start of 2017. Calm returned to Ocean View after a meeting between residents, Community Safety MEC Dan Plato and high-ranking SA Police Service officials. Over three days last week, residents burnt tyres and barricaded entrances along Kommetjie Road. These residents say more police officers have since been patrolling the area. “Over the weekend, special unit police patrolled the area. I hope this is not a temporary solution to keep the residents off the streets. We want sustainability with regards to police presence and policing.” The Community Safety Department will soon arrange an imbizo to highlight safety issues confronting residents.
