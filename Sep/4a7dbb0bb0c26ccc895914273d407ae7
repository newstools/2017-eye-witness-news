                                         CAPE TOWN - Two learners allegedly involved in a bullying incident at a Kuils River High School will be facing a disciplinary hearing. A video, being circulated on social media, shows a grade nine female learner assaulting and swearing at a boy. A bigger boy steps in and punches the learner, who’s being pinned against the wall by the girl, in the face. The incident took place on Thursday. The Western Cape education ministry’s Jessica Shelver says the school has been proactive in dealing with the case. “The school has a zero-tolerance policy against bullying. The principal met with both parents of the victim and the alleged perpetrator on Friday and it was agreed that both will not attend school next week just as a precautionary measure. “Disciplinary action will be instituted against the alleged perpetrator. The disciplinary hearing will take place at the beginning of the fourth term.”
