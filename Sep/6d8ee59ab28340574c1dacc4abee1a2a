Hlaudi Motsoeneng, Simon Tebele and the SABC have been ordered to pay the legal costs for the wrongful dismissal of so-called SABC8 journalists. JOHANNESBURG - The applicants in the case against former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng have welcomed the Labour Court ruling, saying &quot;the so-called SABC 8 feel vindicated&quot;.The court ruled on Friday that Motsoeneng, the SABC s former acting news group executive Simon Tebele and the public broadcaster should pay the legal costs for the wrongful dismissal of the journalists.They were fired after revolting against the corporation s policy of refusing to air footage of violent protests.Seven have since been reinstated.Trade union Solidarity s Anton van der Bijl says while they are pleased with the outcome of this case, they still believe Motsoeneng is the person who should be held liable for the brunt of the costs. He took the decision. Everything started with him and will end with him. He was the decision maker and that s why we proceeded against Mr Motsoeneng. At the same time, media union Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) s Hanes du Buisson says the ruling sends a message. We believe this sends a very strong message to any public service organisation or parastatal that managers cannot be reckless and expect to get away with it. The amount to be paid to both unions is over R1 million and all three respondents will have to pay equally.Solidarity says it s not intimidated by Motsoeneng s decision to appeal Friday s Labour Court ruling.Bijl said: He can appeal he can drag this matter for as long as he wants. We ll oppose the appeal and proceed with the matter. It s been clear throughout the matter that he was part of the decision.
