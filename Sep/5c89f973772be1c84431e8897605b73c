For every tourist who comes to South Africa, they leave behind money that can sustain these jobs.” She says her department has launched a campaign to educate people on how to treat tourists. Xasa says it’s important to show the world that crime is not the culture of all South Africans, but just a select few. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
