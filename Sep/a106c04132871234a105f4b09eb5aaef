LOS ANGELES - Serena Williams has given birth to a baby girl, weighing 6 pounds, 13 ounces, it has been claimed. A source from the St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach is said to have confirmed the arrival to WPBF-25 News. Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, and others also congratulated Williams on Twitter.    Meanwhile, Serena previously revealed she is "looking forward" to motherhood. She said: "I am looking forward to becoming a mother and coming back to the courts already. I'm always thinking about what's next: the next victory, the next trophy ... I intend to keep exercising for as long as possible while pregnant. "I want the baby to be healthy and for that you need a healthy life. Also, when I come back to tennis it'll be better if I've kept as fit as possible all the way through the pregnancy rather than having to lose a lot of weight afterwards in order to get fit again. Eating healthily is a must, but being healthy is a lifestyle." And Williams confessed she is "nervous" about giving birth. She shared: "I'm nervous about childbirth. I'm not a spring chicken. The one thing I really want is an epidural, which I know a lot of people are against, but I've had surgeries galore, and I don't need to experience any more pain if I can avoid it." The 35-year-old sportswomen also previously revealed she thinks having a baby will make her a "real woman". She shared: "I have so much respect for so many women [for giving birth]. I am about to be a real woman now, you know? It's going to be something incredibly impressive to go through ... I don't think watching birthing videos helps. I actually think it makes it worse. Having a baby, nothing is guaranteed."
