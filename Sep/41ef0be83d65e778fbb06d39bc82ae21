                                         JOHANNESBURG - National Assembly Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli has called for an immediate investigation into state capture and says no dodgy explanations will be tolerated. Tsenoli took part in Cosatu's anti-state capture march in Mpumalanga.  He says the country can't wait for the president to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture. Tsenoli says the immediate investigation must focus only on the latest claims to avoid a long drawn-out process. “The immediate thing with that which has happened in the recent past should be dealt with urgently. People deserve better.”  (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
