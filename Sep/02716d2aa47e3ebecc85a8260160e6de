                                         DURBAN – Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Sdumo Dlamini says that Wednesday’s mass action has nothing to do with factional battles or politics but is rather about the plight of workers. Thousands of people are expected to demonstrate across the country against issues including state capture the use of labour brokers and corruption. Dlamini has dismissed claims from other unions like South African Federation of Trade Unions and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa that the march is disingenuous. He has hit out at Zwelinzima Vavi, saying that he must mind his own business and not concern himself with Cosatu. “We raise the plight of the workers in this country, we’re not in any competition with any other federation in this country, new or old.” Thousands of marchers are expected to move through the Durban CBD to the city hall where a memorandum will be handed over to KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu. In Gauteng, the march will start at the federation’s Braamfontein offices, before heading to the City of Joburg to hand over a memorandum. Cosatu’s Dumisani Dakile says that marchers will also hand over memoranda to the country’s big banks. Thereafter, the march will move to the premier’s office before it wraps up at the Chamber of Mines, where Cosatu will demand a moratorium on retrenchments in the mining sector. In Cape Town, demonstrators are expected to march from Keizersgracht at 11:30 and move towards Parliament. Protesters are also expected to demonstrate outside the Passenger Rail Agency's offices in the Cape Town CDB. Additional reporting by Masa Kekana and Monique Mortlock.
