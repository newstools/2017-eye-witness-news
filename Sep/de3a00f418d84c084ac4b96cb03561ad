The proposed tax will target sugary soft drinks in the hopes that consumer behaviour will change. CAPE TOWN - A newly released survey suggests support for a proposed sugar tax is on the rise.The proposed tax will target sugary soft drinks in the hopes that consumer behaviour will change, and obesity and diabetes rates will decrease.Genesis Analysis surveyed 1,000 people and discovered there's been a 16% jump in support for the tax.The company's Dr Saul Johnson explains: In South Africa, we have a major obesity problem. I think we are seeing the consequences of this in terms of diabetes and heart disease. The sample size is small, but Johnson believes the results are sound. It is a fairly accurate representation, but there s always potential for error. It was done with a very reputable company. I think it s a fair representation of South Africans views. Beverage manufacturers and the sugar industry do not support the proposed tax.They warned Parliament earlier this year that its implementation could lead to job losses.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
