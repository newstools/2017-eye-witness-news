The officials will now have to answer to the courts after investigations found they defrauded and mislead the university. JOHANNESBURG - Two senior managers at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) are facing charges of fraud and corruption amounting to R30 million. The Sunday Independent is reporting the pair are accused of siphoning off millions from the institution into their own private business. UJ council chair  professor Roy Marcus and deputy vice chancellor of finance Jaco van Schoor will now have to answer to the courts after a damning report found some irregularities. According to the report, the two senior officials were suspended earlier this year. Itâ€™s understood a whistle-blower lifted the lid on the alleged fraud prompting the university to launch a forensic investigation. At the centre of the allegations is that the UJ chairman of council and vice chancellor of finance used UJ companies to personally benefit from some contracts for the installation of solar geysers.
