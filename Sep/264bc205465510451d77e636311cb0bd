Ford South Africa emphasises safety is an integral part of the re-sculpted version of the Kuga Smart Utility Vehicle.The automaker says its corrected overheating concerns seen in some of the previous models. In December 2015 Reshall Jimmy died after his 2014 1.6 Kuga SUV burst into flames in Wilderness in the Southern Cape. Several other incidents of Kugas catching fire were also reported. But Ford SA Brand Manager, Kuda Takura, says the issue is being dealt with. “We’re not looking at this car as a one fix all solution and that everyone should just forget about what happened in the past. We’re working through part of that past through the dual recalls that we have done.” He adds the company received 39 complaints relating to engine cooling system failures but stresses this won’t be the case in the new models.
