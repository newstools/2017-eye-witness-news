                                         JOHANNESBURG – Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kgayago  says the bank is taking a cautious approach to the repo rate, with inflationary pressures and a volatile rand causing concern. The monetary policy committee has decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.75%. Kgayago says inflation, poor business confidence, and political pressures are still impacting on the country's economy. But he says there is a slight improvement in the overall growth projection. “The bank’s forecast for GDP growth for 2017 has been revised up marginally from 0.5% to 0.6%.” However, the governor says that consumer confidence has improved with the public spending more, with food inflation also expected to decrease. “Food price inflation is forecast to reach a low turning point of 4.8% in the first quarter of 2018, and to average 7.3% in 2017.” Kgayago says that inflation is expected to remain between 3% and 6% over the next two years, but that the Reserve Bank has remained cautions as there are too many other pressures affecting the economy.
