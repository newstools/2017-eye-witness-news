                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his former deputy Mcebisi Jonas have met with KPMG  International chairperson and the newly appointed South African CEO of the firm on Thursday afternoon. The auditing firm has been in the spotlight in the past few days after it cleared its South African leadership and withdrew its findings from a South African Revenue Service (Sars) report into the so-called rogue unit. In a statement released this evening, the pair says they strongly disapprove of the manner in which the firm has been involved in validating state capture and corruption by the Gupta family and the Sars. “We insist on full and proper disclosure of various parties in the state capture project and the manner KPMG staff seem to have colluded in these processes – including the complete disregard shown by the management of KPMG.” They also say “further steps need to be taken by KPMG to be more open and frank with South Africa”. Gordhan and Jonas say despite the meeting with KPMG, they reserve their legal rights. An internal investigation by KPMG has revealed failure over the company's work for Gupta owned firms and Sars. Senior executives have since resigned from the firm and two South African companies have cut business ties with it Earlier this week, Sars commissioner Tom Moyane called for a resolution of a criminal case of those involved in the establishment of the unit. Gordhan, along with other former Sars officials, was accused of establishing the unit. Meanwhile, two South African companies have cut ties with KPMG this week.
