                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court is expected to rule on whether or not Henri van Breda’s legal team can change the order of witnesses. Last week, Van Breda’s lawyer told the court that at this stage the murder accused will not testify, and if he does, it will most likely be after the defence’s expert witnesses have taken to the stand. Judge Siraj Desai will be handing down a ruling on Wednesday on whether Van Breda will be allowed to testify after the defence’s witnesses. The Criminal Procedure Act states that an accused is usually obliged to testify before witnesses for the defence. But Van Breda’s lawyer, Pieter Botha, is hoping that Wednesday’s judgment will give him more flexibility to decide when to call him to the stand. Botha told the court last week that he realises that if he decides to call up his client at a later stage, after expert witnesses, this will reflect negatively on the defence’s case. If Desai rules in Botha’s favour, however, he won’t have to worry about this. Prosecutor Susan Galloway has argued that Van Breda could amend his version should he be allowed to testify after the defence’s witnesses. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
