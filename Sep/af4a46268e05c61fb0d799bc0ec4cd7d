                                         JOHANNESBURG - A district mayor’s bodyguard and a 16-year-old teenage boy are among three people gunned down in a drive-by shooting outside a tavern in KwaZulu-Natal. Police say the victims were standing outside a container on Shezi Road in Mpumalanga township earlier this week when an unknown number of men in a bakkie shot at them. They died on the scene. Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda visited the scene on Friday and spoke with police about security in the area. The MEC’s spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane says police are investigating if the incident is related to taxi feuds or political killings in the province. “The stories that we’re getting from the people on the ground indicate that there were vehicles that were moving into the area, trying to locate the deceased. But all of that will form part of the investigation.”
