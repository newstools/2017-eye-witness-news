                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Southern African Tourism Association will meet with police to discuss ways to increase protection after 36 Dutch tourists were robbed shortly after touching down at OR Tambo International Airport. A bus carrying the group to their hotel on Sunday night was stopped by a man wearing police uniform along with five plainclothes accomplices travelling in a South African Police Services car. The men then tied up the driver and tourist conductor and allegedly ransacked the group's luggage and assaulted some of them. The tourism association’s David Frost said: “The issue of crime and a security thing is an ongoing issue in our country. But clearly, when tourists are targeted it has a major economic impact because it has the potential of those who were thinking of coming here, not coming anymore."
