                                         CAPE TOWN - In the trial of alleged wife killer Christopher Panayiotou the defence will on Wednesday call its first witness. The Port Elizabeth businessman allegedly ordered a hit on Jayde Panayiotou more than two years ago. The school teacher’s body was found on the outskirts of Uitenhage a day after she was kidnapped in front of her Port Elizabeth home. The defence on Tuesday asked for the matter to be delayed by a day as its witnesses were unavailable. Advocate Terry Price said that they’ll be calling four witnesses and that they’d possibly wrap up the case next week. The State closed its case in June. Christopher Panayiotou is accused of paying a former employee to hire men to kidnap and kill his wife. The alleged hitman, Sizwezakhe Vumazonke, died from an illness while awaiting trial. Co-accused Sinethemba Nenembe And Zolani Sibeko are believed to have been his accomplices. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
