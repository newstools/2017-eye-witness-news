Rabbits do multiply quite rapidly and can destroy vast amounts of stretches of grassland and we know that due to inbreeding. We ve assisted the Bunny park in relocating these animals which will help in terms of providing food source for the carnivores. The park has also taken on a sterilisation process by finding homes for almost 1,900 rabbits.
