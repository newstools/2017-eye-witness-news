                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng says while it will take part in tomorrow’s anti-state capture march by Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the South African Communist Party (SACP), it does not support the call for President Jacob Zuma to be removed. The SACP, Cosatu and the provincial ANC all say they're ready for the march in the Johannesburg CBD as part of a national day of action against state capture. Thousands of people are expected to join the mass action. Both the SACP and Cosatu have publicly and repeatedly called for President Zuma to be removed as the head of state. While the ANC in Gauteng has endorsed the march and will also take part in it, provincial secretary Hope Papo says this does not include supporting the call for Zuma to go. “We are not shy, the NEC of the ANC has taken a decision on the president, and Cosatu knows that decision. So we, as a province, cannot change that decision because we are part of a unitary organisation. Decisions of the ANC binds us. And I think Cosatu and SACP respect that, the same way we respect their right to take a decision in their constitutional structures.” He says the party does want to see a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into state capture being established as soon as possible. The Gauteng ANC also wants more action against corruption and state capture from both the public and the private sector.
