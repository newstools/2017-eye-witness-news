                                         JOHANNESBURG - Activists are calling on the government to install cameras in classrooms to improve teaching and learning in the wake of several cases of violence and bullying at schools. In the latest incident, a grade seven boy died at his home in Ekurhuleni on Gauteng’s East Rand earlier this week, possibly as a result of injuries he sustained while being bullied on school grounds. The incident has further raised concerns over the safety of children at schools. Education activist Hendrick Makaneta says installing cameras in schools will tighten the grip on both teacher and pupil discipline. “We believe that the government should install cameras in all the classrooms in South African schools, to make sure that we address the wide range of problems that emanate in the classrooms such as ill-discipline among learners as well as teachers who are not committed to the culture of teaching.” WATCH: Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane: Parents should listen to their children about bullying  Meanwhile, the mother of a 13-year-old boy who died from injuries sustained while fighting off school bullies is angry with how teachers handled the abuse. She said if the school had taken the attacks on her children more seriously, her son would still be alive. She wants her son’s bullies to receive help so that no other child has to go through what her child had to bear.
