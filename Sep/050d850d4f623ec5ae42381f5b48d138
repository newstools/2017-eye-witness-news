                                         JOHANNESBURG - Public Investment Corporation (PIC) chief executive officer Dan Matjila has rejected reports government has asked for R100 billion to bail out state-owned entities.  Matjila was speaking at a briefing in Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon following a meeting with Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and the PIC board.  Weekend reports claimed National Treasury was moving to have Matjila replaced in order to access funds to bail out the SOEs.  The PIC CEO says the board makes investment decisions through internal board processes.  “I’m saying this to dispel this myth that we take investment instruction from National Treasury, we don’t. Most importantly, the issue of R100 billion on the table, we have not been approached, we read it in the media.” Deputy minister and board chair Sifiso Buthelezi dismissed reports of a conspiracy against Matjila.  “As the PIC board of directors, we reject any suggestion that there is something that is being hashed somewhere to remove the CEO of PIC or any other executive.” Matjila says weekend reports about plans to have him removed are inaccurate and designed to force a wedge between himself and Gigaba.  He says he’s lodged a formal complaint with The Sunday Times.  “I think the article that appeared in The Sunday Times is distasteful, inaccurate and designed to drive a wedge between myself, the minister and the board.” PIC board non-executive director Sibu Zulu allayed the fears of pension fund holders.  “We want to assure our clients that we have every intention to protect their funds and to make wise investment decisions.” Minister Gigaba insists there is no plan  to use government employee pension funds to bail out SOEs.
