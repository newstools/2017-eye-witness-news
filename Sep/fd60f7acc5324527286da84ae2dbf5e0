So far, Katy Perry is the only confirmed judge on the reboot, though the likes of Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie have been linked with the jobs. LONDON - Keith Urban insists that no former American Idol judges will be part of the panel on the rebooted show. The 49-year-old country singer was a judge on the talent competition for four years until it ended in 2016 and though the show is being rebooted by ABC, he insisted none of the former panelists - which include Jennifer Lopez, Harry Connick Jr, Randy Jackson, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell - will join host Ryan Seacrest in making a return. He told Us Weekly: "I think it's going to be all new people, except for Ryan." So far, Katy Perry is the only confirmed judge on the reboot, though the likes of Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie have been linked with the jobs. Bon Appetit hitmaker Perry - who has landed a reported $25 million contract for the show - said she was "honoured and thrilled" to be involved with the programme when her signing was unveiled in May. She said: "I am honoured and thrilled to be the first judge bringing back the American Idol tradition of making dreams come true for incredible talents with authentic personalities and real stories. I'm always listening to new music, and love discovering diamonds in the rough - from mentoring young artists on my label or highlighting new artists on my tours, I want to bring it back to the music." And network chiefs were delighted to get Ryan back on board as host. In a statement, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said: "So much of American Idol's overwhelming success can be attributed to Ryan, whose larger-than-life personality and laudable dedication to creating quality entertainment has made him a true master of his craft. His talent is limitless, and I can't think of a more appropriate person to honour the Idol legacy as it takes on new life than the man who has been there through it all."
