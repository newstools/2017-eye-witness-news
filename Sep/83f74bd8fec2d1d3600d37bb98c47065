                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police are yet to make arrests following the murders of at least five miners in the Rustenburg area in the last two weeks. The miners worked at Lonmin and Impala Platinum. It’s unclear whether the killings are linked to union rivalry, however, North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has established a forum to bring miners together and foster reconciliation. The premier’s spokesperson Brian Setswambung says: “They should engage in talking rather than violence. It will be appreciated if they can be part of the solution so as to normalise the situation in the area.” On Tuesday, Mahumapelo appealed for calm in the Rustenburg mining areas after a man was found on Thursday with bullet wounds at the Wonderkop mine. It is alleged that the man was walking alongside his wife when they were ambushed and the victim shot and killed. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
