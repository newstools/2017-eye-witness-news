                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe says the Kwazulu Natal (KZN) ANC took the decision to appeal the court judgement nullifying its 2015 elective conference as a precautionary measure. The ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) is meeting for a three-day ordinary session. Mantashe says the NEC will discuss the political crisis in KZN. He says the NEC has received advice from its senior council which will be discussed. “The court gave us 15 days to appeal. Depending on how you count it, it ended yesterday. But if you are liberal in your counting, you will say it ends on Monday.” He says the KZN ANC didn’t necessarily defy its mother body by announcing its intention to appeal. “What KZN did was to be more err on the side of caution and file their appeal on the last day of the 15 days if you count it conservatively. So when you do that you can withdraw the appeal.” Mantashe says the NEC meeting will carefully consider all the political ramifications in KZN before announcing any steps.
