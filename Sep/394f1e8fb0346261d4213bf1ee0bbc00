JOHANNESBURG - The shutdown in the troubled Vuwani area is expected to continue on Tuesday morning. On Monday, the police dispersed crowds which gathered to demand the implementation of resolutions announced by President Jacob Zuma in July, after months of protests over a municipal demarcation dispute. Matric pupils in the area missed their preliminary exams on Monday. The Pro-Makhado Demarcation Task Team which is leading protests in Vuwani wants to know why the government has not kept its commitment. Spokesperson Nsovo Sambo says: “The only thing which will bring an end to this shutdown is the implementation of that particular decision or redetermination of boundaries.” MATRIC EXAMS More than 2,000 matric learners were forced to miss their preliminary exams after protests once again erupted in the Limpopo town, shutting schools and other facilities. Over 30 schools were either torched or vandalised during similar protests last year. The police's Motlafela Mojapelo says they will maintain their presence in the area until tensions cool off.
