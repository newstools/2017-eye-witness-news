                                         JOHANNESBURG – Ospreys hooker Scott Baldwin may have planned to take on the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein on Friday but ended up having an entirely different kind of big cat encounter. Ahead of the match the 29-year-old visited a nearby game park and petted a group of lions through a fence. However, one lion did not appreciate the attention and made his feelings very clear.  Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy had little sympathy for Baldwin, saying "When you put your hand in a fence where there is a lion, you will get bitten."
