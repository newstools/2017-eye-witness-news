                                         DURBAN - Thousands of Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) marchers chanting “We are ready for Cyril Ramaphosa” made their way through the Durban CBD as part of Wednesday’s national demonstration against state capture. Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini led the KwaZulu-Natal leg of the protest. Cosatu marchers have been singing songs in support of Ramaphosa with many wearing T-shirts that read “CR17” as they march through the Durban CBD. This is despite Dlamini dismissing claims that the demonstration is a proxy battle ahead of the African National Congress' elective conference. “Look, let them say what they what. We are not going to be detracted from our objective which is to have corruption stopped in this country.” MEMORANDUM HANDOVER The marchers arrived outside the Durban City Hall where a memorandum was handed over to KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu. Cosatu President Sdumo Dlamini has called for President Jacob Zuma to institute a commission of inquiry into state capture urgently that will investigate corruption pre-dating the Guptas’ influence. “We must know who is responsible for the Treasury to fail to advance a developmental agenda here in South Africa.” Dlamini has again hit out at his predecessor Zwelinzima Vavi accusing him of being part of the reason why the alliance is no longer at its best - urging him to stay out of Cosatu business. #CosatuStrike Thousands of marchers walking through the DBN CBD singing "We are ready for Ramaphosa" .ZN pic.twitter.com/64qOgLNEhV  #CosatuStrike Marchers now on Dr Pixley kaSeme street in DBN CBD.
