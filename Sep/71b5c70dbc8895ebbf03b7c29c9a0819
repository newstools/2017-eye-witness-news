Cosatu, SACP and ANC supporters taking part in the nationwide strike against state capture are singing pro-Cyril Ramaphosa songs. JOHANNESBURG - Marchers have arrived at the City of Johannesburg’s office in Braamfontein where they're due to handover a memorandum to Mayor Herman Mashaba. Supporters of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), South African Communist Party (SACP) and African National Congress (ANC) are taking part in Wednesday’s nationwide strike against state capture. Cosatu says that Mashaba has destroyed job opportunities and collapsed the city’s services especially in terms of the billing crisis. “A confused mayor, a mayor who has collapsed service delivery in the city.” Cosatu’s General Secretary Bheki Ntshalinshali and the SACP’s Blade Nzimande are leading the march in Johannesburg. Ntshalintshali says the mass action is about getting as many people as possible to take a stand against state capture. “No one is taking the responsibility to those that they must account, it means we are really, really in a banana state.”  Earlier, the supporters taking part in the march were singing pro-Cyril Ramaphosa songs while calling for President Jacob Zuma to go. They’re expected to deliver a list of demands to officials at the City of Johannesburg, other government institutions as well as banks. Songs can be heard echoing through the streets of Johannesburg CBD. Marchers are clad in Cosatu’s red colours, with others in SACP and ANC regalia.  Some placards read, “Zuma must go” and others say, “state capture is a criminal offense”. One marcher says: “All those people who are involved in corruption must be removed. To stop job loses, state capture must come to an end.” Some marchers have also touched on the succession debate, singing songs supporting Ramaphosa.
