                                         JOHANNESBURG - Hillary Clinton has called reports that six Trump White House officials used private email accounts for official business the "height of hypocrisy". President Donald Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton's use of personal email  while she was secretary of state during the 2016 campaign. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner admitted to using his email while five other aides reportedly did so as well. Congress has asked the White House to provide details on the practice. In an interview on Tuesday, Clinton says this shows the Trump Administration "knew there was no basis for all their hyperventilating" about her emails.
