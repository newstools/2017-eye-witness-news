                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg has argued its matter involving two motions of no confidence in Mayor Herman Mashaba and Council Speaker Vasco da Gama are extremely urgent and need to be dealt with before Wednesday's meeting. The party wants to force a vote to remove the pair who’ve refused to place the issue on the council agenda. The ANC also wants the motion to be held through a secret ballot. The ANC’s lawyer William Mokhari is arguing that the speaker of council’s refusal is unconstitutional and the party wants the court to give clarity on the matter. The ANC believes it has 15 Democratic Alliance members who will vote with the party to oust Mashaba. Da Gama says he has no issue with the motion of no confidence but insists he has no power to declare a secret vote but the ANC insists he does. The ANC in Johannesburg says it doesn't trust da Gama to deliver on his promise to schedule two motions of no confidence votes in himself and Mashaba in November. On 29 October, there is another council meeting at which he has agreed to place the motion of no confidence votes on the agenda, but the ANC insists it must take place on Wednesday. ANC and DA supporters are attending proceedings, but there is no sign of Economic Freedom Fighters members. #MashabaNoConfidence ANC have gathered outside South Gauteng Court to support Motion. #MashabaMustGo pic.twitter.com/H53EU4qbFz  #MashabaVote Adv Dali Mpofu is representing mayor Herman Mashaba. ML  #MashabaVote Mpofu: The question of urgency should be dealt with. ML  #MashabaVote Makhari says the election of a new speaker and new mayor must take place immediately after the motion - if it’s successful. ML  #MashabaVote Mokhari: The motion must go through. A motion might not be voted upon. You can’t lock debate. ML  #MashabaVote Mokhari: Is he (Da Gama) entitled to refuse to place a motion of no confidence on the agenda?  #MashabaVote Mokhari says there is no need to ask for the coucil rules to be amended to allow a secret vote. “The rules are perfectly fine.”
