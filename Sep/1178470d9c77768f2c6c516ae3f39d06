                                         JOHANNESBURG – Just Coal CEO Joe Singh has now through his lawyers backtracked saying the R500,000 paid to the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was not to persuade Eskom not to terminate its contract with the company. On Monday, Singh admitted on 702 that he paid the cash to the league with the expectation that it would offer a political solution to problems his firm had with Eskom. Singh approached the young lions after the power utility gave the notice to terminate the coal company’s multi-billion rand contract. Singh was due to address a briefing in Pretoria on Friday but his lawyers showed up instead. Just Coal spokesperson Sisanda Qwabe says, “Mr Singh denies that the motive for the donation was to influence Eskom or any other person. “Just Coal will like to confirm that we’re not condoning any crime, we’re, in fact, a corporate company that’s largely involved in community programmes and our giving is voluntary and without any intent to influence or derive benefits.”
