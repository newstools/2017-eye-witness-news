                                         JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) says false claims of them soliciting a bribe from Just Coal to help the firm retain a contract with Eskom are a smear campaign. CEO Joe Singh admitted to paying R500,000 to the Youth League’s general account, hoping it would convince Eskom  not to go ahead terminating its contract but nothing materialized. The Youth League views it as an innocent donation and says they don’t have anything to do with Eskom to begin with. “We don’t work at Eskom, how do you bribe us for that?” The ANCYL’s Mlondi Mkhize believes that this is a political ploy to tarnish its president Collen Maine's reputation. “It is quite interesting that this surfaces now if it’s not something that is politically sponsored.” Singh says that the Youth League approached them offering their help. “The ANC Youth League came to us and said they will help me and I said okay fine. We didn't give it to any person in their personal capacity. I don’t feel too bad about that.” The ANCYL could not clarify who approached who first for the donation.
