                                         JOHANNESBURG - A well-known community leader in Alexandra has been shot dead after being caught in the crossfire between police and suspected hijackers. Police say Sizwe Mbokazi was struck by a bullet in the far east bank section on Wednesday afternoon. It’s not clear exactly who shot him and police say they are investigating. The police's Kay Makhubele says officers were chasing three men who had just hijacked a motorist. Makhubele says because the suspects and officers exchanged fire, it’s not clear who killed Mbokazi. “We don’t know at the moment who shot the passerby.” He says police watchdog Ipid was called to the scene and is now investigating. “If it is found that the police were the ones that were involved, then the matter will be transferred to Ipid.” Meanwhile, resident Nonhlanhla Chabalala says this is not the first incident of this kind in the area, which often sees shootouts involving police, which puts people's lives at risk.  "And this was in broad daylight. Children were playing in the streets. There were people outside." One of the hijackers linked to Mbokazi's murder was arrested on Monday, but his alleged accomplices are still on the run. (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
