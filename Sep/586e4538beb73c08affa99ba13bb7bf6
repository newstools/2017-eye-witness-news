KPMG announced yesterday that it has withdrawn the findings and recommendations from its Sars report and cleared out its South African leadership. JOHANNESBURG - KPMG International says it's offered to repay Sars for the controversial spy unit report that it conducted and will also make a R40 million donation to NGOs, an amount that's based on fees that the firm earned from Gupta related entities.KPMG announced yesterday that it has withdrawn the findings and recommendations from its Sars report and cleared out its South African leadership.The company's CEO Trevor Hoole is among the eight senior staff who have resigned while another faces disciplinary action and dismissal.The report is partly responsible for the downfall of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan who was accused of knowing and endorsing the rogue unit when he was the Sars commissioner.Former Sars spokesperson Adrian Lackay meanwhile says many others were affected by this report. None of the affected people, from 2015 until now, have been given a fair and reasonable opportunity by KPMG to refute the findings. Where is the justice and compensation for those who were really affected? Lackay is still fighting a constructive dismissal against sars at the CCMA arguing that his working conditions became unbearable amid allegations of the rogue unit's existence.(Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
