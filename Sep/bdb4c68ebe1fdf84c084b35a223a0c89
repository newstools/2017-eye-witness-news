                                         HARARE - The #ThisFlag movement in Zimbabwe says its leader Evan Mawarire has been arrested after speaking out on Facebook about Zimbabwe’s worsening economic crisis. Police drove Mawarire away from his church on Sunday morning.  Mawarire told his congregation on Sunday morning that the police were waiting for him outside.   His #ThisFlag movement then confirmed in a tweet that he’d been arrested and was being taken to Harare Central Police Station. On Saturday, he held a live discussion on Facebook during which he criticised President Robert Mugabe’s government over the worsening economic crisis. He posted videos of long fuel queues and said the bond notes introduced by Zimbabwe’s central bank had failed. During the video, Mawarire urged police not to come looking for him, saying what he was doing was in line with his constitutional rights.   (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
