                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape government says its new alcohol policy is necessary not only to stop alcohol abuse but also to get a grip on crime in the province. On Friday, at least 100 designated liquor officers gathered in the city to discuss the restrictions outlined in a new White Paper on alcohol harms. Community Safety MEC Dan Plato says that the policy, which will eventually give rise to amendments to the provincial Liquor Act, is aimed at driving interventions and changes at community level. "Abuse of substances in the province is alarming and concerning. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to be a contributing factor to interpersonal violence." Plato says the problems women and the youth face as a result of alcohol-related abuse, cannot be ignored. "We have to speak out against those who choose to drink too much and then get aggressive. We have to speak out on behalf of those who are being abused."
