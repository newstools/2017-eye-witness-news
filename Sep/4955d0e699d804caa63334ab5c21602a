Sars Commissioner Tom Moyane announced on Monday that the revenue service will take legal action against the auditing firm over what he calls 'its unethical conduct'. JOHANNESBURG - South African Revenue Service (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane says that he's calling for the speedy resolution of the criminal case against those involved in the so-called rogue unit, saying the KPMG statement will not exonerate them. Moyane announced on Monday that the revenue service will take legal action against the auditing firm over what he calls "its unethical conduct". KPMG has withdrawn the findings of its Sars report, saying that the language used in some sections is open to interpretation. It also cleared out its South African leadership, including the company's CEO. Moyane appears to disagree with KPMG, saying that he doesn't find the report problematic. "I want to say that the report by KPMG is not flawed." At the same time, the Sars commissioner says that he's astonished by some former employees and others who feel that the withdrawal of the report vindicates them. "With others claiming that their careers are destroyed as a result of KPMG's report, either are grossly ignorant or are outright mischievous." Moyane says that KPMG's report confirms the findings from the Sikhakhane Commission that there was a rogue unit operating at Sars.
