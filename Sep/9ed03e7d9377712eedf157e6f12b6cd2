                                         PRETORIA - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has launched a fresh salvo against Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane over her Absa bailout report, saying she failed to conduct a diligent investigation as required by the law and the Constitution. Gigaba makes the comments in a second affidavit submitted in Treasury's legal challenge of the report, in which he raises fresh grounds for review. The Public Protector has been widely criticised for her work on this report and has even been accused of conspiring with the Presidency to undermine the Reserve Bank. Gigaba says advocate Mkhwebane made haphazard conclusions of law and fact, relying on random, unsubstantiated and selected documents placed before her. He has complained that the record of decision is incomplete, with transcripts of meetings with key witnesses missing. Gigaba says the Public Protector failed to ask for information from relevant parties to assist her investigation. He says her conclusions are so lacking in logic, it’s clear that the investigation did not receive proper attention. Mkhwebane’s office says she’ll address these claims and others in her answering affidavit. (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
