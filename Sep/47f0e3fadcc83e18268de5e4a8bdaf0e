                                         ZIMBABWE â€“ There are fears that Zimbabwe could be facing a repeat of its 2007-2008 economic crisis. Central bank governor John Mangudya says rumours of looming shortages should be dismissed with contempt. But that's not stopped customers in some supermarkets stocking up on goods, like cooking oil. There have been fuel queues at some service stations in the capital too, 10 years since the last economic crisis peaked. Some stations were only accepting credit cards to a value of $30. Consumers who want fuel worth more than $30 have to pay in cash, which is in short supply. The central bank governor says foreign currency allocations had been increased to ensure there are no shortages of essential goods. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
