The special NEC meeting was expected to take a final decision to uphold or overturn the KZN ANC's decision to appeal the ruling. The party's secretary-general Gwede Mantashe says that they will spend the next three days seeking legal counsel about an issue they have with some part of the judgment. #ANCNEC Mantashe says NEC must deal with issues in ANC, to avoid them landing in court. CM  #ANCNEC Mantashe "we must ensure that when disputes arise, we resolve them ourselves" CM  #ANCNEC Mantashe says a task team will be constituted to help organize an elective conference in KZN,says they have 9 months to do that.  Mantashe says they will make their decision after three days. "The NEC, however, felt that there was a need for further consultation with legal counsel to gain better clarity on the decision of the court as it deals with rule 7.2.1 of the SA Constitution and further engage the possibility of success in appealing the judgment."
