                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) presidential candidate Lindiwe Sisulu has come out in defence of deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, saying that the story about his alleged extra-marital affairs was nothing but dirty tricks. Sisulu spoke to Eyewitness News on a wide range of issues. The ANC NEC is meeting on Friday afternoon. Sisulu believes that the story published by the Sunday Independent was meant to interrupt Ramaphosa’s campaign. “Why would it matter now what kind of man he is when it did not when he was chosen as the deputy president? If he had that problem, it should’ve surfaced a long time ago.” WATCH: Lindiwe Sisulu on campaigning, Zuma and dirty tricks  In September, Ramaphosa admitted to having an affair and revealed that he told his wife eight years ago and then ended the relationship. He told the Sunday Times that he had an affair with his doctor many years ago. The Sunday Independent reported that Ramaphosa had a number of affairs and had copies of Ramaphosa’s emails to back this up. The deputy president responded by saying he is not a blesser, adding he that helps 54 young people financially every month. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
