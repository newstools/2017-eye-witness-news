                                         JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) says Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)’s call for a national strike is an act of desperation. This comes after the trade union federation and its alliance partner the South African Communist Party (SACP) announced it will take part in a countrywide strike against state capture next week. Cosatu says it expects about 100,000 people countrywide to take part in Wednesday’s march. Numsa’s national spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi says this is nothing more than Cosatu’s desperate attempt to remain relevant. Cosatu called for all workers to go on strike against state capture and corruption.The irony is that the federation is very much part of the very system of kleptocracy which has captured the African National Congress. Numsa views these calls for socioeconomic strike against the very government which Cosatu is an alliance with as nothing more than the federation’s desperate attempt to remain relevant.
