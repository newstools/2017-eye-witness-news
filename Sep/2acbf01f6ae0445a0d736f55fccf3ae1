                                         CAPE TOWN – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says although coalitions are not “perfect” - he insists the party's relationship with key partners remain intact in municipalities where they govern.  The DA, United Democratic Movement and most recently the Patriotic Alliance are at loggerheads in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro over who should be the deputy mayor. The party is reportedly also in trouble in the Johannesburg metro as DA Mayor Herman Mashaba could face a motion of no confidence in council. Maimane says coalitions are like a marriage and everyone has to work on keeping it together. “We’re going to have to work harder at these things. They’re new for our democracy, but I am grateful to say where things have worked. We’ve been able to pass budgets , governments are fully at work and they’re delivering on mandates.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
