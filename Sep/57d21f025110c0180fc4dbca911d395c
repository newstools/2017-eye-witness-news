                                         CAPE TOWN - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says he’ll ask fraud investigators in London to probe McKinsey in terms of the UK’s Bribery Act. Maimane says that the firm appears to have paved the way for the controversial Gupta-linked company Trillian to make money off Eskom because of a sub-contractor deal. The DA has also acted locally by laying criminal charges of fraud, racketeering and collusion against McKinsey. Maimane says he’ll soon write to the Serious Fraud Office in London. “Requesting an investigation into the dealings in terms of the UK’s Bribery Act. The DA will not back down in our pursuit of proper accountability in these matters. As it was evident in the Bell Pottinger case, those in the private sector who are caught in dodge dealings will be brought to book.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
