                                         PRETORIA - The High Court has questioned the apparent failure of law enforcement authorities to act on allegations of criminality made against the Guptas and their associates. The comments were made in the judgment handed down in Pretoria on Thursday where nearly two dozen Gupta-owned companies lost their bid to keep their last remaining bank accounts open. The Bank of Baroda now has the go-ahead to cut ties with the controversial family's business interests at the end of this month. In 16 bullet points, Judge Hans Fabricius listed the allegations of money laundering, fraud and corruption identified by the Bank of Baroda as its reasons for cutting ties with the Guptasâ€™ companies. He says that while he is not in a position to comment on the allegations, he is questioning whether democracy and the rule of law have been suspended. Fabricius enquired whether the constitutional duties imposed on the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) still exist. He went on to ask if the police still remember their constitutional duty to combat and investigate crime. The NPA recently told Parliament that investigations based on the Gupta leaks are underway.
