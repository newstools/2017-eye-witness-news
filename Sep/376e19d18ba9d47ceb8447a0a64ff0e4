The data contained in the Business Confidence Index is a great indication of the economy&#8217;s future trajectory. CAPE TOWN - Businesses remain pessimistic about the environment in South Africa. This is evident by the latest data released by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) earlier on Wednesday.The data contained in the Business Confidence Index is a great indication of the economy s future trajectory.Between April and June, the BER s business confidence took a plunge just after the Cabinet reshuffle and credit rating downgrades.Although spirits among business executives have since improved, their confidence in the South African environment remained disappointingly low in the third quarter.The research group says the data points to a less than desirable environment for an economy trying to pull itself from the doldrums.It has advised the government to implement structural reforms to help turn the economy around.These include effective governance of SOEs, ensuring quality education, better immigration policies and less red tape.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
