                                         PARIS - Qatar’s foreign minister said on Monday that US President Donald Trump was keen on ending a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region via dialogue between the various parties. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told reporters in Paris that he had seen from President Trump a “greater desire” to fix the crisis and that Trump “doesn’t want to see conflict among friends.” Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut political and trade ties with Qatar on 5 June, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their arch-foe Iran - charges which Doha denies.
