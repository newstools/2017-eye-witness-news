                                         CAPE TOWN - South Africa ticks all the boxes to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup. That’s the opinion of rugby writer Mark Keohane. A delegation led by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa made the official presentation in London on Monday to host the event. The country is promising record profits, the most player-centric tournament ever and a nationwide carnival as it tried to convince international rugby administrators why South Africa should play host again. Keohane says country stands a good chance. “Their projections are there would be R27 billion direct and indirect economic impact to South Africa and R5.7 billion of that would flow to low-income households and they’re talking about 39,000 temporary or permanent jobs that would be sustained and then there's R1.4 billion tax benefit to the government.” SA Rugby says a South African Rugby World Cup in 2023 would be an unbeatable triple-win, for the sport, supporters and the players. The Rugby World Cup company will announce a preferred candidate on 31 October and that recommendation will be put to a vote of the World Rugby Council on 15 November. Jurie Roux, CEO of SA Rugby, says South Africa ticks every single box of the financial, commercial and logistical requirements of the host. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
