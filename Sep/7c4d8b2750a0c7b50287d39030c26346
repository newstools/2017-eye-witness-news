                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) member Bheki Cele has warned the party could lose the 2019 elections if it doesn't start listening to the people. Cele says there was a time the party was warned about losing metros which are now run by the Democratic Alliance (DA) but didn’t listen. He was giving an address on the unity of the ANC and its alliance partners in Pretoria on Thursday. Cele says the ANC has already lost significant metros and has called on branches to help turn the tide. “At least now the Union Buildings is under [Tshwane Mayor Solly] Msimanga, there might be time if we don’t wake up, that even the Union Buildings won’t be under the ANC.” He says the DA is undoing the work the governing party has done by giving unqualified people the power to lead. “Johannesburg cannot be run by a person who runs salons, Johannesburg is not a salon to run Black Like Me there.” Cele says sentiments such as the one made by MKMVA leader Kebby Maphatsoe on the resignation of Makhosi Khoza are what decay the party and shouldn’t be encouraged.
