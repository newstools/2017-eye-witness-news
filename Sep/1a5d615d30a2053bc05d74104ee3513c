                                         JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba is briefing the media on reports that the National Treasury wants to use R100 billion of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC)’s funds to bail out state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Gigaba says he has never made any request to access PIC pension funds to bail out SOEs. The minister was speaking after meeting with the PIC's chief executive Dan Matjila and the board. Reports over the weekend claimed the minister wanted to obtain about R100 billion. Gigaba says there is simply no truth the claims. “There is no R100 billion that we’ve requested from the PIC. I want to assure everybody that their pensions are safe and there is absolutely no attempt to dig into their pensions for reasons that are unscrupulous.” He says he takes a dim view of having his name dragged into articles which he is not involved with. “I asked a few questions from the board because arising from these allegations, there is a number of issues that obviously need to be clarified and it was important to me in the interest of the pension holders, whose assets are being held by the PIC.” WATCH: Gigaba briefs the media following his meeting with the board of PIC
