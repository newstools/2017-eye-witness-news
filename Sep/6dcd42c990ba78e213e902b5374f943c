                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) will examine a judgment that it pay costs in a matter dealing with political party funding. Lobby group My Vote Counts successfully argued in the Western Cape High Court that parties be forced by law to disclose private funding. The DA was the only political party to oppose the matter. Wednesday's judgment means independent ward candidates who stand in municipal elections will also have to reveal who has sponsored them. In her judgment, Judge Yasmin Meer says that knowing who has funded political parties is "reasonably required" to make political choices. She agreed with the applicants that the Promotion of Access to Information Act is invalid insofar as it does not allow for disclosure of private funding to political parties and independent candidates. My Vote Counts national coordinator, Janine Ogle, said: “What it means is that Parliament has already started the process but that the process must be completed within 18 months.” The DA had argued that donors often requested anonymity. A draft bill on funding disclosure is currently open for public comment as part of the work being done by a Parliamentary ad hoc committee. The DA's James Selfe says the party will engage with the issue again when the bill is formally put before the House.
