                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Gauteng Education Department says that it will use several measures including an Ernest & Young forensic investigation into alleged financial irregularities to resolve the crisis at Klipspruit West Secondary School. The school has been plagued by a series of disruptions this year, including the rejection of a black principal by the local coloured community. Educators boycotted lessons last week after some of their colleagues were barred from teaching over accusations of misconduct. Community leader Anthony Phillips says: "Anything that’s underhanded, anything that the community is not satisfied you can be sure that the community will come back, they will take up their position again."
