Avian influenza has spread to The Duck Farm in the Joostenbergvlakte. CAPE TOWN - Thousands of ducks have died and many have had to be culled amid an outbreak of bird flu at a Cape Town farm. Avian influenza has spread to The Duck Farm in the Joostenbergvlakte. Some ostrich farms in the Oudtshoorn area have also been affected by the deadly flu strain, as have poultry farms in the Helderberg region. Owner of The Duck Farm, Leon Groeneveld, says that bird flu cases were detected last week. In a matter of days, thousands of ducks died or had to be killed. “The mortality rate was 10,917. These birds died. We culled 24,580 birds on the farm.” The farm's local deli has been shut down. Nearly a hundred staff members have had to be laid off. Groeneveld says that millions of rands have been lost and it will be months before the farm will be able to do business again. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
