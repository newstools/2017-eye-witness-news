                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s decision to keep Dudu Myeni at the helm of the South African Airways (SAA) board is irrational. The party says her request for a R6 billion bailout from The Public Investment Corporation is another reason why she should be removed as chairperson. The party’s Alf Lees says that Myeni has run the airline into the ground. “The company is in severe financial stress. Whether it is legal or not is irrelevant. She has been party to a crumbling SAA. It’s not about legality, it’s about doing the right thing and ensuring the company is being run properly.” Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba insists that the extension of Myeni's contract as chairperson is above board. Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance requested an explanation from Gigaba for extending her contract. He argues that the extension is in line with SAA’s Memorandum of Incorporation and the Companies Act. The DA believes that the minister’s failure to remove Myeni shows that SAA is clearly not his priority. Additional reporting by Koketšo Motau & Lindsay  Dentlinger. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
