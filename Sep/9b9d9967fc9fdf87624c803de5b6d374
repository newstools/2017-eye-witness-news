                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee member Bheki Cele says the party must stick to its traditions when electing a new president. Cele was speaking in the capital on Thursday night on the unity of the party and its alliance partners. He says since its existence, the governing party has religiously elected the deputy president to the top position and should so with Cyril Ramaphosa. Cele says the calls for a woman to take over leading the ANC post-December are misguided. “We are electing the capable, not because you’re a man or a woman, but because you’re capable to lead the ANC and we do that within the traditions.” He says even President Jacob Zuma was elected because of this tradition. “They tried to change the tradition in Polokwane and as the membership of the ANC, we said no, we refused for that tradition to be changed. Then the deputy president became the president.” Cele says he supports no candidate - just tradition. KZN LEADERSHIP Cele says the party's national executive committee (NEC) is to blame for a recent Pietermaritzburg High Court decision nullifying KwaZulu-Natal’s 2015 provincial elective conference.    The court ruled the decisions taken at that conference were unlawful and void. Cele said had the NEC not allowed for an early conference, KZN would still be united. “One of the reasons why that province is divided is the wrong decision we took as the NEC. It pains and sometimes embarrasses [me] to be a member of the NEC because decisions we have taken have put us on the back foot.” The ANC NEC will on Friday make a final decision on whether to appeal that court ruling.
