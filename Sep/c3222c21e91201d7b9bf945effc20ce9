                                         JOHANNESBURG - As the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) prepares for a special meeting on Friday morning, presidential hopeful Lindiwe Sisulu has raised questions over why the party refuses to hold a consultative conference. The party’s leadership is expected to take a final decision on whether to appeal a court ruling declaring the ANC KwaZulu-Natal's 2015 elective conference unlawful. Sisulu says she hopes the NEC will discuss why the party's leaders rejected a request by the stalwarts to hold a consultative conference. “A consultative conference is not one where we talk about policies going forward, it is one where we talk about the here and now. What is the health status of our organisation?” When asked if she thinks Friday's meeting must discuss another motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, she said: “What would the difference be between now and before?” Meanwhile, Cosatu has called for the special meeting to discuss the possible reinstatement of criminal charges against Zuma and take bold decisions about what it calls his lack of leadership capabilities.
