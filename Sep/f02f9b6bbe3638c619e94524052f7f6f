                                         CAPE TOWN - The Drift City Motor Show kicks off at Cape Town’s Grand Parade this afternoon. Thousands of visitors are expected to flock to the drifting spectacular that showcases drivers' skills as they negotiate obstacles on a tough track. The show is now in its second year. The City Of Cape Town, which is one of the sponsors, sees the event as a platform where motoring enthusiasts can compete in a safe and controlled space. This motoring discipline involves drivers intentionally oversteering, resulting in loss of traction in the rear wheels or all tyres. The aim is to maintaining control of the vehicle while negotiating a track constructed on Cape Town’s Grand Parade. Event organiser Gary Stockenstroom says an action-packed show awaits spectators. “There’ll be about 30 drivers going back to back in a battle against time. We also have some play areas for the kids and a go kart track. We’re closing down Darling Street so we’ll have a food court too.” He says hosting the event on the Grand Parade adds to the appeal of the show.  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
