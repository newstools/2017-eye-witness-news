                                         JOHANNESBURG - The United National Transport Union (UNTU) has filed a contempt of court application against the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) and three of its senior officials in the Labour Court.  It says acting group chief executive manager Lindikaya Zide failed to honour his promise to set a date to resolve 19 disputes.  They range from medical aid insurance, overtime hours and general working conditions.  The union’s Sonja Carstens said: “That’s why we went for the court application and the court granted the order in our favour. But ever since Prasa’s acting group CEO Lindikaya Zide has promised to meet with us and to ensure that he complies with the court order and he’s just not being forthcoming.”
