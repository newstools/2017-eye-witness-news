                                         PRETORIA – Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has dismissed any suggestion there are plans by Treasury to dip into the pension funds managed by Public Investment Corporation (PIC) to bail out ailing state-owned companies.  The minister made the comments on Tuesday following a meeting with the PIC’s board and chief executive. Weekend reports claimed that plans were afoot to have chief executive Dan Matjila removed in order to facilitate the capture of the PIC.  Minister Gigaba says that he called the meeting to allay fears among pension fund holders.  “They shouldn’t fear for their assets, there’s absolutely no truth to the allegations that there’s a looting campaign out there that seeks to dip dirty hands into the R1.9 trillion of PIC.”  Matjila described reports of a conspiracy to oust him as inaccurate.  “I enjoy good support from the minister, good support from the deputy minister. I enjoy good support from the board of PIC.”  Matjila has lodged a formal complaint about the report and says he will issue a statement on the matter on Wednesday.
