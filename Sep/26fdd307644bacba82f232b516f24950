                                         JOHANNESBURG - SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande says a judicial inquiry into state capture that dates back to 1994 will take too long and it should for now focus on recent corruption allegations. Nzimande was addressing thousands of marchers who took to the Johannesburg CBD where memoranda were handed over at the mayor's offices, FNB, Chamber of Mines and the premier’s office. Nzimande said the march was not against the ANC, but rather what was wrong in the party. Speaking in isiZulu, Nzimande told workers that money that had been taken and sent to Dubai must be returned to South Africa. Nzimande accused the Hawks and NPA of not acting against what he called broad looting. "The inquiry must start as far as 1994. It will take 20 years until the commission of inquiry can report on it. We are saying it must start with what’s currently happening." He says the inquiry can include a second phase which can look into corruption dating from 1994. (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
