                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says while it hopes that the mistakes made in reference to presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma are human error, its editorial checks and balances need to be scrutinised. The public broadcaster has recently come under fire after Dlamini-Zuma was referred to as "mini Zuma" in August and the president’s ex-wife last week. The SABC has since apologised and launched an investigation into the matter. The SABC’s Nomsa Philiso says that initially, management had thought that the omission of the first part of Dlamini-Zuma’s surname reading as "mini Zuma" was simply human error, but the second mistake last week has raised questions about intent and even malice. “To our quality control quantity, that's what we thought it was… to say maybe there was a lack of oversight but now we want to make sure that is all it is.” Philiso says that even human error needs to be accounted for. The broadcaster’s spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago’s response to the mistake has also been widely criticised. He said: "It’s silly season leading up to the elective conference, where everyone is accusing us of doing our jobs incorrectly." Speaking at a cadre’s forum in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday, Dlamini-Zuma addressed the obligation of the media to report on the truth, saying while she accepts the apology by the SABC she hopes they will not have to apologise a third time.
