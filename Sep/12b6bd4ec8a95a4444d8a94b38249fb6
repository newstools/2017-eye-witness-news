                                         CAPE TOWN - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says that while private companies implicated in wrongdoing in the alleged state capture project are taking steps to correct their mistakes, the African National Congress (ANC) government continues to dodge accountability. Therefore, he wants the National Assembly to set up an ad-hoc committee to look into the issue before the end of October. Companies such as KPMG, McKinsey and Bell Pottinger have all been accused of aiding the Gupta family’s attempts to corner key state contracts at the expense of taxpayers. Maimane says that the “wheels of accountability” have begun to turn at KPMG, with the resignation of several top executives, but the auditing company can do more to redeem itself by opening its books to the public. Parliament, on the other hand has been slow to act, he says. In June, four oversight committees were directed by House chairperson Cedric Frolick to investigate the allegations, but only one committee has made any progress. "Just the lack of urgency frustrates the constitutional mandate given to the National Assembly." Maimane says that if National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete doesn’t agree to the request, the DA reserves its right to take legal action. Maimane says that Mbete must also establish a disciplinary committee, in line with Parliament’s rules, to consider whether Cabinet Ministers fingered in the leaked Gupta emails have breached their constitutional duties. The names of Malusi Gigaba, Faith Muthambi, Des Van Rooyen, Lynne Brown and Mosebenzi Zwane have all featured in the scandal.
