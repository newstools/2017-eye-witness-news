                                         CAPE TOWN - The Garden Route National Park has urged South Africans to take a moment to reflect on their natural assets as they celebrate Heritage Day.  The national holiday embraces South Africa’s cultural diversity and rich history. But don’t forget about the plants and animals that make South Africa unique, says SANParks.  Spokesperson Nandi Mgwadlamba says: “We had a cultural event that focused on cultural activities in the Tsitsikamma section on Saturday and we also had a sunset serenade in Wilderness… that was to bring people out so they could see and appreciate the beauty in the national parks.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
