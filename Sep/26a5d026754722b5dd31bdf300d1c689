                                         CAPE TOWN - In an open letter to all Cricket South Africa (CSA) staff and all its stakeholders, the former chief executive of CSA Haroon Lorgat says the organisation is moving into a new direction and it’s the right decision for him to move on. CSA announced on Thursday that Lorgat and the organisation had decided to part ways amicably on the opening day of the international cricket season. Lorgat says his time at the helm of CSA was challenging but he’s proud of the enormous steps the organisation has taken since taking over in 2013. In the letter, he points to success stories such as the CSA being a sustainable business, the efficient administration, global admiration for best practice and a new league around the corner. However, it seems the T20 Global League, which Lorgat spearheaded, has been his downfall as CSA announced on Thursday that Lorgat and the board could not remedy their grievances. The Global League, which is just over a month away, is yet to announce the sale of the broadcasting rights of the tournament which is key to the CSA coffers. Lorgat says he looks forward to a restful period at home with his family.
