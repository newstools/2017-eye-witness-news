                                         JOHANNESBURG - The rand stretched gains on Friday as the central bank’s surprise decision to keep lending rates on hold rippled through the market and drew flows into the bond market, while stocks were mixed. At 1500 GMT the rand was 0.62% firmer at R13.2025 per dollar, nearing its firmest level in a week in relatively subdued trade ahead of a bank holiday on Monday. “There is a little bit of risk-on globally but the biggest kicker is definitely the Reserve Bank’s decision not to cut rates unchanged yesterday,” said a currency dealer at TreasuryOne, Phillip Pearce. “Everyone had been positioning themselves for that cut only for it to come in completely different, and now you’re seeing an influx back into the bond markets which obviously buoys the rand because it is very reliant on portfolio flows,” Pearce said. The South African Reserve Bank on Thursday left lending rates unchanged at 6.75% following a 25 basis point cut in July, upending unanimous market bets it would deliver a second rate cut to support flagging economic growth. The rand’s gains were also spurred by a slide in the dollar as renewed flare-up of tensions between North Korea and the United States knocked the greenback, with the index measuring the currency against six rivals fell 0.4%. Bonds yields continued to a recovery from three-week highs on Thursday, with the yield on benchmark government paper due in 2026 down 2 basis points to 8.455%. On the stock market, the benchmark Top-40 index was up 0.03% at 49,564.68 points, while the broader All-share index declined 0.05% 55,839.73 points. Gold mining firms got a boost from the higher bullion price as investors sought a safe haven from geopolitical uncertainty caused by rising tensions between North Korea and the United States. The JSE’s gold mining index was up 1.3% to 1,306.82 points, as the bullion price rose 0.4% to $1,295.77 an ounce by 1524 GMT. AngloGold Ashanti advanced 2.6% to R124.50.
