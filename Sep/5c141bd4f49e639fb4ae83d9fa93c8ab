                                         JOHANNESBURG – In an unprecedented move, a national strike planned for Wednesday has received the backing of several business associations. Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) has pledged its support for the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) led industrial action. The labour federation called the strike to protest corruption and state capture. Business Leadership SA’s Bonang Mohale explains the strike has the thumbs up from affiliate groups. “I can confirm that Business Unity South Africa (Busa), which is our umbrella apex body has already supported this call. The Chamber of Mines has, the Banking Association of Southern Africa has done that and the Black Management Forum.” But former Cosatu affiliate, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), won’t back the strike. It’s slammed the federation's partnership with the African National Congress (ANC). Meanwhile, the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry says it won’t support the action. It adds that it is usually the working class who suffer in a national strike as many may lose their day’s wages. The chamber’s Janine Myburgh says: “We don’t agree with the strike. A strike is never in anybody’s interest and the people who really suffer are at the lower end of the economic scale. Those are the people we should protect the most.”
