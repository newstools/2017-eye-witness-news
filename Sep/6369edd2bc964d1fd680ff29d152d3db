The Hamptons estate features a 12,000 sq ft house, along with a 1,800 sq ft guest cottage and sits on a two-acre site. Beyoncé and Jay Z’s new retreat has seven bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms, which are “sculpted with marble selected in Verona, Italy”, according to Trulia.com.

Jay, 47, is well known to be a big fan of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, and he has enough space to invite them to Los Angeles for a game as his house boasts a full-size court. There is also a media room and separate staff quarters. The pair’s property purchases came just a few months after they were said to be struggling to find a new family home, despite boasting a budget of around $75 million. Beyoncé, 35, and rapper Jay - who have daughter Blue, five, and three-month-old twins Rumi and Sir Carter - were said to have been outpriced on abodes they took a fancy to which were going for double their house fund. A source recently said: “They want a super baller, crazy estate, and the ones they love are going for $150 mil.”
