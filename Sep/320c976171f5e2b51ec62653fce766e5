JOHANNESBURG - The South African Post Office (Sapo) says it has contingency plans in place to deal with a strike by the Communications Workers Union (CWU). The union served the Post Office with a 48-hour notice to strike last week. Sapo says that while some of its employees will join the demonstration, it doesn’t expect any of its services to be disrupted. CEO Mark Barnes says: “We’ve communicated those to our clients, staff and stakeholders. The whole thing is being professionally managed and we don’t expect it to be disruptive.” Network distributors, Sentech and Broadband Infraco, are expected to be affected as a result of the strike.
