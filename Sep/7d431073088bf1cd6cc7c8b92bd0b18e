                                         HARARE - A leading association of churches in Zimbabwe has accused President Robert Mugabe's government of being irresponsible in the face of a growing economic crisis. The Zimbabwe Council of Churches says Zimbabweans have lost trust in their government and that trust isn't built by misrepresenting facts. It says in the face of the present fuel queues and shortages, it's irresponsible for any government official to claim that all is well. Many Zimbabweans have been stockpiling fuel and basic goods in recent days, anticipating shortages as the foreign currency crisis worsens. In a statement, the Council of Churches says such fears are legitimate in the absence of what it calls “adequate formal information”. It says Zimbabweans have lost trust in government's sincerity in addressing national problems.
