                                         JOHANNESBURG - Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has appealed to political leaders to reflect before criticising the judiciary, urging them to be factual in their criticism. Despite the judiciary holding a meeting with President Jacob Zuma two years ago on attacks by senior African National Congress leaders, judges have continued to come under fire from some in the governing party. Earlier this year, National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete went as far as accusing sections of the judiciary of bias. Mogoeng is calling on politicians to be more measured in their statements. “As a member, you are a role model to many, just reflect before you speak how those who follow and look up to you are going to understand the message that you’re sending through. And make sure that it’s not going to be perceived as something that is not inciteful.” The Chief Justice says it will be helpful to the judiciary if criticism coming from political leaders is specific and constructive. Mogoeng says politicians citing specific cases where the judiciary has faulted would be more helpful. “It does help to be specific, otherwise, criticism is welcomed. We are far from perfect and we’re simply striving towards perfection on a daily basis.”
