                                         JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC) says it will now approach the highest court in the land to ensure a motion of no confidence vote against Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and Speaker Vasco Da Gama is tabled. Last night, the High Court in Johannesburg struck its application from the roll for lack of urgency. However, the ANC’s Jolidee Matongo says that they won’t give up and want the vote by way of secret ballot. “We’re convinced that the rights of councillors to present such motions of no confidence of both the mayor and the Speaker have been trampled upon by the Speaker. “So we’ll be approaching the Constitutional Court on an urgent basis to get the court to hear the matter.” Meanwhile, Mashaba’s spokesperson Tony Taverna-Turisan says there was no need for the matter to go to court. “We’re ready to defend this matter in any court. We find it quite concerning that they have immediately jumped to the Constitutional Court when it has been so clear from the proceedings that there’s no urgency in this matter.” WATCH: Joburg ANC's secret ballot court bid fails
