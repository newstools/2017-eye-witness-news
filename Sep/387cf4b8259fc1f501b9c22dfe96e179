                                         CAPE TOWN - Water management devices may soon be a reality in all households across the Western Cape.The city says it will install the devices in at least 50,000 households. Cape Town is trying to reduce collective water usage to 500 million litres per day. The City of Cape Town's Xanthea Limberg says those who consume water most, will be dealt with. “We are having to focus on those high consumers to see the impact that we require. The high users will be targeted first and then we’ll do a mass rollout of other residential consumers, whether they be higher consumers or not.” At the same time, the University of Cape Town researchers say harvesting stormwater may be the key to off-set the current water shortage. The Western Cape is experiencing one of its worst droughts in decades with dam levels around 37.5%. Researchers say the stormwater that falls on the city at the moment is managed through a network of ponds and channels. It's then diverted into rivers and out to sea. Civil engineer and PhD researcher John Okedi estimates at least 15 million kilolitres of stormwater is lost annually in the Cape. The drawback of harvesting it is that it's usually very dirty. Building the infrastructure for the system could take several years, but researchers believe this may be a valuable way to supplement the Mother City's water supply. But researchers are convinced it's a cheaper alternative compared to desalination. Aquifer management is being explored as another option which may add 33 million litres of potable water into the system. This method has already been effectively implemented along the West Coast, albeit on a small-scale. Building the infrastructure for the system could take several years, but researchers believe this may be a valuable way to supplement the Mother City's water supply in future.
