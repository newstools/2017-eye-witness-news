Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown issued a statement expressing her disappointment at what she called Eskom’s 'inappropriate and tardy responses' in a report on its dealings with the Gupta-linked company. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has met Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown's deadline to respond to specific questions about the utility's relationship with Trillian. Brown issued a statement on Friday expressing her disappointment at what she called Eskom’s “inappropriate and tardy responses” in a report it handed in over its dealings with the Gupta-linked company. Eskom had claimed that payments of R1.6 billion to Trillian and consultancy firm McKinsey were above board, but it then emerged that a New York-based firm had in fact red flagged these transactions and recommended a legal review. Brown says the report she received from Eskom earlier this month was not signed off by the board's chairperson and it contained glaring gaps about the utility's relationship with Trillian. Brown wants the board to clarify a number of issues including disciplinary processes, investigations into questionable contracts and why there were two conflicting statements about Trillian. The minister also expects a plan with specific timelines on how to deal with these issues. The report she received on Tuesday is expected to help her determine the scope and nature of the decisive action required to restore Eskom’s credibility.
