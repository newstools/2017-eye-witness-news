                                         JOHANNESBURG - Despite previous endorsements of Cyril Ramaphosa by some Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) leaders, the deputy president may not be supported by the province come the party’s elective conference in December. The party’s provincial chairperson Paul Mashatile says his previous pronouncement that he supports Ramaphosa is not cast in stone, saying Gauteng is open to persuasion.  Mashatile was speaking on the sidelines of the Human Settlement Development Summit in Boksburg. Mashatile says while he might have endorsed Ramaphosa, that may change.  “Our decisions are not cast in stones… we’re ready to be persuaded.” He says out of all the presidential hopefuls, whoever persuades him enough is guaranteed his support and subsequently that of the province.  “At the moment I’m not ruling anybody out. If somebody persuades me enough… I’ll say fine.” Mashatile is part of the ANC provincial leaders under the banner the United League, who are working towards agreeing on an uncontested leadership slate to avoid a bruising contest at the party’s elective conference.
