JOHANNESBURG - An Equality Court order instructing the owners of The Lake Restaurant in Brakpan to change a policy barring same-sex couples from the facility is being hailed as a big step for the Constitution. Earlier this year, an Eyewitness News investigation revealed how the East Rand restaurant refused to allow same-sex couples entry on date night, which is held on Thursdays. WATCH: No gays please! It's 'date night' in Brakpan  After the report, a homosexual couple took the Lake Restaurant to the Equality Court for violating their rights by denying them entry. The court has now ordered the owners of the establishment to apologise on its Facebook page and stop the discriminatory policy. The lawyer who represented the couple, Tshego Phala, says: “I think it’s a big step for our Constitution and I think it’s important that matters like this be mediated. This is one of the purposes of the Equality Act; it’s there to be restorative and redress prejudice.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
