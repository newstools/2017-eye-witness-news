                                         CAPE TOWN - The Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) has condemned the torching of two buildings at its Cape Town campus, allegedly by protesting students and workers. A building and a church at the university’s Cape Town campus were torched.  The institution’s Lauren Kansley says, “The constant attacks on CPUT’s structures are distressing, but the despicable action of setting a church alight is the most heinous attack of all. We’ve reported one arrest so far and the campus security continues to work closely with the SA Police Service to bring more of these criminals to book.” WATCH: CPUT students clash with police during violent protests  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
