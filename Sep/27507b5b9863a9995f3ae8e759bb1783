Panayiotou, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko appeared briefly in the Port Elizabeth (PE) High Court on Tuesday. CAPE TOWN - The trial against alleged wife killer Christopher Panayiotou and two others has been postponed until Wednesday. Panayiotou, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko appeared briefly in the Port Elizabeth (PE) High Court on Tuesday. The PE businessman allegedly orchestrated Jayde Panayiotou' s murder in April 2015. The trial against Panayiotou and his co-accused was meant to resume on Tuesday, but the defence has asked for it to be rolled over until Wednesday. Advocate Terry Price says his witnesses are only available then. Price told the court he intends calling four witnesses to testify. The State concluded its case in June. The court has already seen video footage of a police sting operation in which Panayiotou is in discussion with the alleged middleman in Jayde's murder. In it, Panayiotou allegedly implicates himself in his wife's killing. The court has ruled that the video footage is admissible.
