                                         BENGALURU - Russian champions Spartak Moscow have been charged by Uefa after fans displayed illicit banners and set off fireworks during the 1-1 draw against Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday. Disciplinary proceedings also cover blocking of stairways and illicit chants at the Group E game in the Otkrytie Arena. It is the second time this month that the club has been charged by European soccer’s governing body. During Spartak’s 1-1 draw in their group opener at Slovenian champions, NK Maribor on 14 September a flare fired from the visiting supporters’ stand almost hit German referee Deniz Aytekin. The club was fined €60,000 and banned from selling tickets to supporters for their next away match in Europe, at Sevilla on 1 November. Uefa’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will deal with the latest case on 19 October.
