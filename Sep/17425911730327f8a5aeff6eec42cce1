                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma will host his Zimbabwean counterpart President Robert Mugabe next week where the two presidents will review bilateral relations between the countries. This is the first time Mugabe is coming to South Africa since his wife Grace was granted diplomatic immunity after being accused of assault. Rights group AfriForum has since taken the matter to court arguing that International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane misinterpreted the law when she granted the Zimbabwean first lady immunity. Presidency spokesperson Bongani Nqulunga says Mugabe will attend the South Africa-Zimbabwe Bi-National Commission (BNC). “The BNC will provide a platform to strengthen and deepen warm and cordial bilateral relations between the two countries. It will also review the actual progress on bilateral undertakings and commitments made during the inauguration section of the BNC in 2016.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
