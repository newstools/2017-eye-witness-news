You have a leadership that is totally disconnected, especially management, which takes bad decisions and which is unable to implement the correct decisions. He says the committee has made it clear to employees that if the airline is once again going to receive a lifeline from state coffers, it will have to change its behaviour. There is no bottomless pit of money from which they will continue to draw money whenever they fail to run that entity.
