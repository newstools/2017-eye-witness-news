                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says President Jacob Zuma  must not delay the appointment of a new board to oversee the affairs of the SABC, which has recorded an operating loss of nearly R1 billion.  The cash-strapped public broadcaster published the loss in its 2016/17 Annual Report. It was a turbulent financial year for the SABC, featuring changes to its policy on local content and the dissolution of the broadcaster's board. The term of the five-member interim board appointed to restore stability to the SABC came to an end on Tuesday. But President Zuma has yet to appoint the 12 people recommended by Parliament to fill non-executive positions on a permanent board. The DA's Phumzile van Damme say Zuma must immediately make the appointments. “The SABC’s annual report tabled in Parliament yesterday paints a really grim picture about the financial status of the SABC. Legal costs up to a billion ... losses up to a billion.” According to the SABC's Annual Report, the Auditor-General noted that the public broadcaster was "commercially insolvent" at the end of March. The SABC has reportedly applied for a R3 billion bailout from the government.
