                                         CAPE TOWN - Chairperson of Parliament's transport committee Dikeledi Magadzi says a state capture probe into the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) is partly being hampered by matters still before court. The committee has been ordered by Parliament's House chairperson to investigate claims of state capture. But it is yet to decide on exactly how to proceed. The transport committee has submitted a report on engagements with Prasa over the past two years to House chairperson Cedric Frolick for guidance on how to proceed with a state capture probe. Magadzi said: “The tenders and contracts that are in court ... we are unable to look into because we are awaiting the court outcomes.” In July, a R2.6 billion locomotive contract was declared illegal. The Democratic Alliance's Manny de Freitas says Prasa must be stopped from entering into any new agreements while there is no leadership. He's demanding that Minister Joe Maswanganyi appoint a new board within the next 10 days.
