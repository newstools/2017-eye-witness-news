The IFP says that wherever there’s political violence in the province, the ANC is in some way involved. DURBAN - Former KwaZulu-Natal Premier Senzo Mchunu is expected on Wednesday to give testimony at the Moerane Commission of Inquiry investigating political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) on Tuesday told the commission that the African National Congress (ANC) is always the common denominator when there’s violence in the province. The IFP claims that the commission was initially set up to only probe the murders of ANC councillors.  The IFP’s Blessed Gwala says that the ANC has called for a commission to investigate political killings in the province because its own councillors are now being murdered. He says that their members have been killed over an extended period of time and they’ve been calling for an investigation for a long time now. The IFP says that wherever there’s political violence in the province, the ANC is in some way involved. It recommended that the South African Police Service be depoliticised because the absorption of Umkhonto we Sizwe soldiers into the service has contributed to it being an extension of the ruling party.
