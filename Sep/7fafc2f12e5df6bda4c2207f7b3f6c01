Zweli Mkhize says political tensions in the province, which have resulted in multiple murders of ANC leaders, are worrying. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize has told Eyewitness News the leadership of the party must partly take responsibility for the political killings in KwaZulu-Natal.Former ANC Youth League secretary general Sinsido Magaqa died on Wednesday after being shot, along with two other councillors in KwaZulu-Natal two months ago.There have been political tensions in the province which have resulted in the murders of many ANC leaders.Mkhize says this is worrying. I think it s leadership that needs to be standing firm and being strong to actually ask the question: what is happening there and why should be happening inside a space where there is no clear conflict among all the other members? It is important that the leadership of ANC needs to tighten the grip at that level. LESSONOn Tuesday, Magaqa was described as a humble servant who always put others first.A prayer session was held at his home near uMzimkhulu.Senior ANC leaders and members descended on Magaqa's home village in Ibisi in uMzimkhulu.KZN ANC chair Sihle Zikalala said the ongoing killings of comrades has become an embarrassment. The killings of the comrades is an embarrassment. Whenever it happens, it's embarrassing the organisation. But more so it s becoming bad for KwaZulu-Natal ANC NEC member Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said Magaqa's life should serve as a lesson for both the party and the country. Comrade Sindoso has taught us lots of lessons, young as he is ... that whatever happens to you in the ANC, the ANC is bigger than all of us. Jabulile Mzizi and Nontsikelelo Mafa who were with Magaqa on the day of the shooting were also there for the prayer service.Additional reporting by Ziyanda Ngcobo.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
