                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Makhosi Khoza says the party doesn’t value or respect intellectual women. Khoza announced that she's quitting the ANC on Thursday because it's no longer the party she once knew.  She says the emancipation of women cannot be realised under "this" ANC. “The new alien and corrupt ANC and some of its leaders have consistently shielded perpetrators of violence against women and treated women as sex objects. The alien and corrupt ANC does not value intellectual women.” CORRUPT Khoza says if everyone involved in corruption and those implicated in the Gupta emails were to be prosecuted, most of the party’s leaders would be in jail. She was due to appear at a disciplinary hearing next month, after publicly calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down ahead of the motion of no confidence. The KwaZulu-Natal branch says it has been vindicated, while the national ANC says they're concerned about the manner in which she has raised issues. Khoza insists that corruption has been institutionalised in the ANC. “It is my well-considered view that almost 80 to 90% of the ANC leadership would have to replace their tailored shining suits and pretty dresses with orange overalls. Their only natural home is prison.” She says she no longer wants to tap dance with the greedy hyenas of the ANC or be ridiculed for acting with moral conscience.
