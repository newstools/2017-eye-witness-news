                                         JOHANNESBURG - Sizwe Ntsaluba Gobodo has quit as auditors of Gupta-owned Oakbay Resources and Energy. In a statement released a few minutes ago, the board says it took the decision after a thorough assessment of its relationship with the company which has spanned a period of 18 months. This decision has been communicated to Oakbay. Troubles are piling up for Gupta-linked companies after leaked emails exposed how the politically-connected family used its sway over Cabinet ministers and state-owned entities to score lucrative state contracts. The firm said it's not allowed to publicly discuss its client's affairs due to professional obligations of confidentiality. It's the latest firm to cut ties with Oakbay after major banks and KPMG ditched the Guptas. In July, Oakbay Resources and Energy was given permission to voluntarily delist from the JSE.
