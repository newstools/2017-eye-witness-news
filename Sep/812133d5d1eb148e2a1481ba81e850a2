                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eyewitness News can confirm that the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) hasn't even started its probe into Eskom  because it still needs to be approved by President Jacob Zuma. As far back as July, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown told South Africans that she had asked the SIU to investigate allegations of corruption and state capture at Eskom and she recently called for the unit to expedite its probe. The power utility's own report seen by EWN has shown the extent to which some Eskom officials - including CFO Anoj Singh - went to cover up dealings with Gupta-linked company Trillian. Eskom has announced that Singh has been suspended, a day after its acting chair Zethembe Khoza confirmed the sanction to EWN. Khoza says "several other executives" have also been suspended and he insists this shows that the utility takes action when evidence of wrongdoing is discovered. The president has to give the SIU the go ahead, and the request hasn't yet landed on his desk. However, Khoza says Eskom has already put forward some issues it wants the SIU to look into. Brown says she is still going through Eskomâ€™s report and will respond with her plan of action in due course. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
