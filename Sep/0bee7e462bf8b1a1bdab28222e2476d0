The woman's boyfriend allegedly beat her to death with a shovel. CAPE TOWN - The Commission for Gender Equality has expressed outrage at the murder of a De Doorns mother, allegedly by her boyfriend. The 25-year-old accused appeared in court earlier this week, following his arrest over the weekend. He allegedly beat the 26-year-old mother to death with a shovel. The Commission for Gender Equality has called the murder of 26-year-old Laurina Ryk senseless and barbaric. It says the murder once again places the spotlight on intimate partner killings and is a reminder that gender-based violence is not being addressed effectively. Police claim Ryk and her boyfriend had an argument at the Vergenoegd Farm, where she lived, before he beat her over her head with a shovel. Meanwhile, it was revealed in Parliament this week that police had failed to make over 220,000 arrests in connection with domestic abuse over a two-year period. In the Western Cape, more than 32,000 complaints were received, but just 624 arrests were executed. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
