                                         JOHANNESBURG - Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) General-Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says both former presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki let their deputies succeed them and has questioned why President Jacob Zuma would like his Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to succeed, when she is not his deputy. Thousands of marchers took to the streets of the Johannesburg CBD on Wednesday, joining the Cosatu-led strike supported by the South African Communist Party (SACP) and African National Congress (ANC) in the province. The tripartite alliance says while the relationship at the national level has collapsed due to corruption, the alliance in the province still enjoys a strong relationship and also agree on matters relating to graft and state capture. Thousands of Cosatu, ANC and SACP members marched across South Africa, with many carrying placards calling for President Zuma to go. Ntshalintshali says former presidents post-democracy have typically been succeeded by their deputies and questioned why Zuma is supporting Dlamini-Zuma instead. “Why is the president choosing to support his ex-wife to succeed him.” Also addressing the marchers, the SACP’s General-Secretary Blade Nzimande said should a certain faction win December’s elective conference, the ANC of Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela will die.
