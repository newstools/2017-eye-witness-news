The ZCC has accused the media house of gutter journalism and mocking its leader. JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) is urging the Zion Christian Church (ZCC) not to follow through with a planned boycott of Tiso Blackstar newspapers.The church has urged its 16 million members not to buy the Sunday World, Sunday Times, Business Day and the Sowetan after it was reported that Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane faces arrest over a dispute with church leaders in Botswana.The papers say a group of ZCC pastors have taken the church to court to oppose the merging of branches.But the ZCC has hit back at Tiso Blackstar, accusing it of gutter journalism and mocking its leader.Sanef s Sam Mkokeli is calling on the church to seek alternative remedies where it feels it has been defamed. We do not support their call for a consumer boycott. There are some very good institutions out there that can deal with such grievances.
