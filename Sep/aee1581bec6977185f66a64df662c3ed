                                         NEW YORK - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says a landmark pricing deal announced by UNAids will accelerate the availability of the first affordable, generic, single-pill HIV treatment. It'll also save South Africa billions of rand. Motsoaledi helped unveil the agreement in New York on Thursday. The agreement is expected to help boost global efforts to get high-quality ARVs to all 36.7 million people living with HIV. UNAids estimates that just over half of this number has access to the lifesaving medicines. Minister Motsoaledi says the pricing agreement, which will make the medicine dolutegravir more affordable for governments in low and middle-income countries, is a breakthrough for the 3.9 million South Africans that rely on ARVs. “We estimate over the next six years, South Africa will potentially save about R11 billion; it is very critical.” He says the country expects to launch its tender for the purchase in April next year.
