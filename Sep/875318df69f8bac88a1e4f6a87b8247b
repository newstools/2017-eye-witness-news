Former President Kgalema Motlanthe says that he previously raised his concerns about the party and its current leadership to internal structures. JOHANNESBURG - Former President Kgalema Motlanthe says the fact that former African National Congress (ANC) leaders like himself are speaking out against the current leadership of the party shows that the organisation is in a big crisis. Motlanthe says that given President Jacob Zuma's high frequency of indiscretions and wrongdoings not having him in office could create a new environment. He says that he previously raised his concerns about the party and its current leadership to internal structures. "The fact that we are at a point that we are speaking out means that we are in a deep crisis, otherwise under normal circumstances, we would not be criticising." Motlanthe earlier reacted to a question by Radio 702 host Eusebius McKaiser on whether the ANC and the country would be better off if Zuma would not be president tomorrow. The former president recently told the BBC that he believed the ANC should hit rock bottom and lose elections for the penny to drop in the minds of ANC members. "Indeed it would create a new environment, because each time there's a scandal involving the head of state, it's diverting the eyes of the nation away from the real issues."
