The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa opens its doors on Friday and it's free to the public this weekend. WATCH: Zeitz MOCAA: From grain silo to SA’s first contemporary art museum  World renowned British architect Thomas Heatherwick has transformed Cape Town's old grain silo into the Zeitz Mocaa, a nine-storey building that's a work of art in itself. The original silo cylinders have been cut into massive tubular shapes which stand at the centre of the BMW Atrium, the museum’s main atrium. A giant multi-coloured hanging installation is the first piece to greet visitors. It was created by Nicholas Hlobo and it is titled Iimpundulu zonke ziyandilenda, which means “all the lightning birds are after me”. There are more than 80 galleries with various art pieces and installations spread across the seven floors open for public viewing.  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
