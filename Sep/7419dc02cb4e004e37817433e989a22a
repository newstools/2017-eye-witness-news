Twitter users have responded to Bafana Bafana&#8217;s 2-1 loss to Cape Verde. CAPE TOWN What s worse than being cheated on?Well, one South African says supporting Bafana Bafana.Twitter users have responded to the team's 2-1 loss to Cape Verde at the Estadio Nacional with humour and disappointment.The national team has suffered a major setback after Cape Verde derailed their chances of reaching the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Coach Stuart Baxter says players didn t aim for their normal standard . I think we can find excuses or reasons, I think this is one of the reasons. We didn t find focus or composure to keep playing. We opened the game well. But when they threatened us, we had a good opportunity and they countered on us. It was a bit sloppy. South Africans were not impressed with Bafana s performance and took to Twitter to share their feelings.One of the 100 reasons why I stopped watching Bafana Bafana ... its worse than being cheated on. #StressedTFO pic.twitter.com/HmYIgf4KLBWhen you hate BAFANA BAFANA and how they play but have to support them coz they represent your country. pic.twitter.com/o14xRoKQgGBAFANA BAFANA is the retarded cuzin we hav 2 watch play sports.
