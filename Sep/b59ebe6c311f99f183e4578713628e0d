                                         JOHANNESBURG - The strike at Petra Diamonds's Finsch Mine in the Northern Cape is expected to intensify this morning following failed negotiations between mine management and workers. Hundreds of miners affiliated to union NUM  downed tools this month demanding a 10% wage hike across the board every year for three years, including housing subsidies and medical aid. Sixty-seven workers at the mine staged a four-day protest underground before they agreed to surface last week on condition that no disciplinary action be taken against them.
