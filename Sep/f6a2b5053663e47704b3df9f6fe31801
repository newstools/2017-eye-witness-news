                                         PRETORIA - The hand-picked successor to Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has been sworn in as Angola’s second president since independence from Portugal in 1975. Joao Lourenco swore to devote himself to his role as president. Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, who became president in 1979, was at Tuesday’s ceremony attended by dozens of African leaders, including President Jacob Zuma. He’s in poor health, which led to his surprising retirement. The ruling MPLA won 61% of the vote in last month’s election. The drop in support is attributed to the economic crisis caused by falling oil prices. Lourenco has his work cut out, ensuring more of the wealth from being Africa’s second largest oil producer trickles down to the people,  more than half of whom live in abject poverty.
