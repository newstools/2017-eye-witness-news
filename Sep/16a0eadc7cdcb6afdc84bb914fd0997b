                                         HARARE - Zimbabwe protest pastor Evan Mawarire has appeared in court on Monday morning, charged with subverting President Robert Mugabe's government. Mawarire pleaded not guilty to the charge, which stems from nationwide protests he helped to organise last year. Photographs from the High Court showed Mawarire arriving, dressed in a maroon tracksuit and wearing handcuffs. He spent a night in custody on Sunday night, following his arrest on a second charge of subverting the government. His latest arrest came after a video he recorded, calling on people to unite in a non-violent action to confront the growing economic crisis.
