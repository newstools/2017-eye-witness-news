                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has dismissed suggestions that the federation’s president Sdumo Dlamini is absent from preparations for Wednesday’s national strike against state capture due to his close relationship with President Jacob Zuma. The trade union federation along with the South African Communist Party (SACP) will be holding a mass demonstration in an attempt to put pressure on the state to investigate and stop corruption. Cosatu’s deputy general secretary Solly Phetoe says that Dlamini will be mobilising workers in KwaZulu-Natal to join the shutdown. “He has to lead the marches. He’s deployed in KZN, he has to deliver in terms of what Cosatu says.  “This decision about Cosatu is not about Sdumo, the leadership of Cosatu, centrally, are responsible or are given that mandate to lead and that’s what we’re doing and let’s not talk about individuals.” Meanwhile, the SACP’s second deputy general secretary Chris Matlhako says this march is extremely important. “We need to have corrective measures in the ANC, that’s why the party has called for the recall of the president. And we know what the implications are... the creation of the shadow state. Therefore, when you deal with the head of it, there are real possibilities in the ANC to correct [what has happened].”
