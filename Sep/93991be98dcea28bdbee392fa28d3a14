                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has announced the candidates that will be running for leadership positions in the Western Cape. Cape Town mayoral committee member for the east region, Ando Ntsodo, is the surprise candidate for provincial leader. He will be running against interim leader Bonginkosi Madikizela and party veteran, Lennit Max. Nominations for the DA's provincial congress have officially closed. Madikizela will be hoping to make permanent his appointment as interim provincial leader, a position he assumed after Mayor Patricia de Lille's resignation in January. Member of Provincial Legislature Max will be hoping it's fourth time lucky for him, while city councillor Ntsodo will be looking to upset the apple cart. The post of provincial deputy leader will be a two-horse race between Social Development MEC Albert Fritz and Member of Parliament Mnqasela Masizole. Local Government MEC Anton Bredell will be going up against Cultural Affairs Affairs MEC Anroux Marais to retain his job as provincial chairperson. Three deputy chair posts will be up for grabs, contested by several city councillors including DA council whip Shaun August and mayoral committee member JP Smith. Provincial legislature speaker Sharna Fernandes, Eden Municipality Mayor Memory Booysen and Breede Valley mayor Antoinette Steyn are among those also vying for a deputy chairperson post.
