JOHANNESBURG - The National Treasury has defended recent staff appointments, saying all those who’ve been moved into new roles are competent enough to do the required work. Last week, three key staff members were removed from their posts, in a move slammed by the opposition as an attempt to sideline those who worked under former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The officials who’ve been moved around are acting chief procurement officer Schalk Human, acting accountant-general Jayce Nair and acting chief director for the integrated financial management system Phila Mhlakaza. Treasury released a statement on Monday, stating that it’s made the changes to its senior management because it would be unhealthy for officials to act in positions for too long. Spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete says: “The people who’ve been replaced are also National Treasury officials. Some of which have been in the department for up to 15 years. It would be unhealthy to have officials acting in certain positions for long periods of time.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
