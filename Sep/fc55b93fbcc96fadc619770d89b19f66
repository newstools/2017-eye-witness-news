JOHANNESBURG - People won't be able to report complaints of police brutality at the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) office's in the Johannesburg CBD on Monday due to ongoing power cuts. The Ipid says its offices at Marble Towers in Jeppe Street have been closed for over a week now after mass cable theft caused a blackout in large parts of the city. City Power has assured residents that power will be fully restored by Tuesday morning. Ipid's Moses Dlamini says in the meantime they've moved their staff to the Gauteng district offices in Tshwane. “Our clients and people are advised to direct their complaints to our district office on 012 399 0000. The provincial office will resume operations in Johannesburg once the electricity supply is restored.”
