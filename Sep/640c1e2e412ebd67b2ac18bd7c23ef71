                                         CAPE TOWN - The Global Alzheimer’s and Dementia Action Alliance (GADAA) says dementia is currently costing the world close to $1 trillion. The global alliance published an article on the World Economic Forum’s website in September to commemorate World Alzheimer's Month. It tallied the costs of dealing with the medical conditions of Alzheimer’s and dementia, which are often associated with old age. If dementia expenses were a country, it would be the 16th largest in the world between Indonesia and Mexico. That’s according to GADAA. The organisation says most of the costs lie in the unpaid care of those suffering from dementia with many people, especially women, having to stay home to care for family members who suffer from the condition. The global alliance says this is mostly due to dementia not being formally diagnosed or even recognised in several countries. It says if countries continue to view dementia as a normal part of ageing and don't finance long-term care for its victims, the condition could become a $2 trillion crisis by 2030.
