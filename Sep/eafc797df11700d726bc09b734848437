                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says he has raised concerns with the National Basic Education Department about an increase in killings in schools. On Tuesday, a deputy principal was shot dead in his office at a primary school in Duduza by three men who allegedly posed as electricians. Lesufi visited the East Rand school shortly after hearing of the incident and says that pupils and teachers have been left traumatized. Lesufi says it appears the deputy principal had just come out of a class he was teaching when he was confronted by the suspects and shot a number of times. He says he is concerned about how many people are losing their lives in the province’s schools. “Last week, I had to attend a funeral of a security guard that was shot dead inside school premises. A week before, another guard was also killed at a school. There are just certain types of criminals in our schools.” Lesufi says he has escalated the issue to Minister Angie Motshekga. Police are investigating a case of murder.  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
