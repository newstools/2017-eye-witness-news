                                         JOHANNESBURG - Just Coal CEO has admitted to paying R500,000 to the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in return for help with a political solution to the firm's problems with Eskom. When Eskom gave notice to terminate the contract with Just Coal after 10 years, CEO Joe Singh sought help from the ANCYL. The Sunday Times is reporting that ANCYL president Collen Maine accepted the donation and promised to help stop the scrapping of the contract. Singh has admitted that he expected that after paying the donation, that his contract with Eskom would not be cancelled any more. "My expectation whether they would help, not my hope, is that they will ultimately deliver. So as much as you'd have an expectation, we moved in five or six different ways and whichever was a good cause, we thought let's use it and if it doesn't, then we'll continue doing what we do." Legal expert Cathy Powell says she believes Singh might have publicly admitted to committing a crime. "It is a crime under the Prevention and Combating Corrupt Activities Act to give a benefit or gratification to somebody with the intent of getting that person to do something unlawful."
