                                         SHANGHAI/SEOUL - China’s earthquake administration said on Saturday it had detected a magnitude 3.4 earthquake in North Korea that was a “suspected explosion”. The administration said in a statement on its website that the quake, which occurred around 0830 GMT, was recorded a depth of zero kilometres. Previous quakes from North Korea have indicated nuclear tests by the reclusive state, the most recent earlier this month. The quake was centred near North Korea’s nuclear test site. South Korea’s weather agency said it was analysing the nature of the quake and its initial view was that it was a natural earthquake.
