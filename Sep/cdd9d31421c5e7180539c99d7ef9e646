                                         PRETORIA - The Public Investment Corporation says it is continuing talks with the Sunday Times following a report, which its chief executive Dan Matjila described as distasteful and inaccurate. Matjila made the comments in Pretoria on Wednesday following a meeting with the board and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. Weekend reports claimed plans were being hatched by some board members to have the chief executive removed from his post in order to facilitate the capture of the PIC. Matjila declined to say exactly which parts of the Sunday Times article he found distasteful and inaccurate but he committed to issuing a statement on Wednesday to answer those questions. But the PICâ€™s Deon Botha says they are continuing to talk with the publication to find the most appropriate way to address their concerns. He did not reveal what their concerns are but says they are confident a solution will be found to enable Matjila to express himself fully on the record. Matjila and Gigaba rejected reports there were plans to plunder the pension funds managed by the PIC to bail out ailing state-owned entities, including South African Airways.
