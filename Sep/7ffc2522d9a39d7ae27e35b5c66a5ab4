Henri van Breda's lawyer sought a court application allowing him to call his client to take the stand after his expert witnesses have testified. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court has dismissed a request by Henri van Breda's legal team to change the order of the defence's witnesses. Van Breda's lawyer, Pieter Botha, sought a court application allowing him to call his client to take the stand after his expert witnesses have testified. He is accused of killing his parents and brother and for the attempted murder of his sister in 2015. Judge Siraj Desai says that the defence has not given convincing reasons as to why Van Breda should testify after the defenceâ€™s expert witnesses. Desai says that if his lawyer decides to call his client to the witness stand at a later stage, the court will draw inferences on Van Breda's conduct. Botha has told the court that his client will not be giving evidence. The Criminal Procedures Act stipulates that an accused has to testify first, before the defense's other witnesses.
