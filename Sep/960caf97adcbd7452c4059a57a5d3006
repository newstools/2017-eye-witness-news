                                         CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Community Safety MEC Dan Plato says that allegations of corruption involving police officers stationed at the Ocean View Police Station are being investigated. Plato visited the community following three days of anti-gang protests in the area. This past month saw a surge in violent deaths in the community at the hands of criminals. Police are on full alert as the situation in Ocean View remains volatile. Residents have accused local police officials of locking the station at 7pm at night and depriving them of protection. They also allege that some police members are in a corrupt relationship with gang members. Plato says that restoring calm to the area is a key objective. "I was in a discussion with General Jula and I've talked to his deputies and all of the issues raised will definitely receive the necessary attention." Angry residents have also demanded that protesters arrested over the past two days be released from custody. #OceanViewProtest Locals are angry, blaming authorities for not doing enough to deal with gangsters @BrandtKev - KB pic.twitter.com/ZSgvzicpk7  #OceanViewProtest Protesters are demanding provincial police chief,Khombinkosi Jula,address them on gang violence gripping the community.KB pic.twitter.com/vcuWrjIWU6
