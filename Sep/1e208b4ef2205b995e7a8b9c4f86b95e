                                         MANDENI - ANC NEC member Fikile Mbalula has urged the youth in KwaZulu-Natal to elect the party's next president based on merit and not because of the narrow interests of a few individuals. Mbalula is speaking at the Youth League’s 73rd-anniversary celebration in Mandeni north of the province. The police minister says the branches should have the final say over who they want to lead the ANC but the process must be led by principles of the organisation. #ANCYL Mbalula: the leadership debate must not be led by those who are guided by narrowism  The NEC member says a leader in the party is elected by the branches and if the structures call for a candidate to become president they should not feel shy to declare their preference. Mbalula says he finds it convenient that when the Women's and Youth Leagues called for Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to lead, people started talking about her previous marriage to President Jacob Zuma. “Let’s judge comrades on their own character and not on where they were born.” #ANCYL Mbalula: let's judge comrades based on their character and merit.Whether you support Nkosazana or Cyril .  He says the party is not an organization without its own challenges but they should be given the space to resolve them the ANC way. (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
