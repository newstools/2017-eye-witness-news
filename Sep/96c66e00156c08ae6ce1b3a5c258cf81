                                         CAPE TOWN - National Treasury says not helping South African Airways (SAA) repay its lenders would be far more detrimental to taxpayers than if the airline defaulted on its loans. The airline has until Saturday to repay Citibank R1.8 billion. Treasury Director General Dondo Mogajane says Friday’s transfer of R3 billion forms part of the R10 billion recapitalisation of the airline to allow it to start afresh. It's new chief executive Vuyani Jarana will be taking over the reins on 1 November. Government is guarantor for loans worth R16.4 billion to the airline but lenders have had enough of waiting for their money. Treasury spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete says government won’t be selling off the airline because of its benefits for trade and tourism. “There's an expectation for SAA to turn itself around and become a commercial entity and not be as dependent on the fiscus as it's been.” Government has already given SAA R5.8 billion so far this year. But Tshwete says despite the billions in bailouts to the airline over the years, it’s far less than what other governments have invested in their national airlines.
