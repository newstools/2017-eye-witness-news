The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse  (Outa) says it has evidence that Sassa awarded the tenders for outreach programmes about a year ago, without following due process. CAPE TOWN- The Social Security Agency (Sassa) says it's taking legal advice on claims that it entered into two irregular contracts worth R400 million. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it has evidence that Sassa awarded the tenders for outreach programmes about a year ago, without following due process. Outa has given the agency two weeks to respond to the claims or face legal action. Outa says whistleblowers have blown the lid on corruption at the Social Security Agency, hiring an events company that also works with the Presidency, to perform outreach work in all provinces for three years. Outa's Dominique Msibi says Azande Consulting has allegedly already been paid R220 million for less than a year's work. “There is no clear project plan with regard to what the deliverables are and how they are going to go about achieving those deliverables.” Msibi said Sassa must explain how a competing company which produced a detailed work plan for a quarter of the price was unsuccessful. Sassa spokesperson Kgomotso Diseko says the agency will respond to the claims once it's studied the Outa report.
