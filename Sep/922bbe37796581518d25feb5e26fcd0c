Media reports suggest certain sections haven't yet opened as the hospital did not receive the promised R500 million from govt. JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has criticised claims that government has failed to honour its agreement to fund the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital in Johannesburg. The facility was opened nine months ago and caters for specialised treatment for children. Media reports have indicated that certain sections haven't yet opened as the hospital has only received R150 million from government and not R500 million as promised. But Motsoaledi says this is nonsense as the money is being released in stages. “What we have done is what is according to schedule and they were given R150 million for that. The R500 million they are talking about, I’m not sure where it comes from because the Minister of Finance had said R600 million and it was over a period of three years.” He says the hospital is being rolled out according to plan. “They need to make sure that every equipment is functioning the way they want it to, to check if all systems are running well and they started on a small scale.”
