                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)’s annual report paints a grim picture of the state of the public broadcaster’s financial affairs. The SABC is without a fully-functioning board because the interim board’s term came to an end on Tuesday. President Jacob Zuma’s office said this week that he was still considering the 12 names that were recommended by Parliament to fill non-executive positions on the Board. DA MP Phumzile van Damme says President Zuma should immediately appoint a new board to oversee the affairs of the SABC. “The president must now, urgently, appoint the permanent board and he can no longer afford to delay this.” The public broadcaster recorded an operating loss of nearly R1 billion over the past financial year. It’s more than double what it incurred the year before. It was a turbulent time for the SABC amid changes to its local content policy, a breakdown in governance and an inquiry into the fitness of the previous Board. In March, an interim board was appointed to restore stability to the organisation. It was given six months to do its work. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
