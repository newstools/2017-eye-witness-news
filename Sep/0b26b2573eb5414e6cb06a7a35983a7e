                                         JOHANNESBURG - Home Affairs Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize says allegations made against her following her decision to suspend director general Mkhuseli Apleni are delusional. Apleni has filed urgent papers in the High Court in Pretoria after being placed on the precautionary sanction by Mkhize last week, giving no official details. In an affidavit Apleni says his suspension is linked to several allegations including a R1 million dispute been Apleni and the minister's son. He says it's clear the minister didn't apply her mind to facts that were at her disposal when she took the decision to suspend him. Mkhize has now reacted, saying the allegations against her are an insult to her integrity. “They are like an insult to my integrity. I come a long way with state resources and state authority.  "I cannot be subjected by a person to a position where it’s almost like I don’t know what I’m doing. I’ve always known what I’m doing. I’ve always been careful with power.” (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
