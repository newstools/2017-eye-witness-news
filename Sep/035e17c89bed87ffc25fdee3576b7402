                                         LONDON - Everton substitute Oumar Niasse struck twice in the second half as the Blues clawed their way back from a goal down to notch a superb 2-1 win over Bournemouth in a spiky encounter at Goodison Park. The home side played some brilliant one-touch football in a tough first half that saw Wayne Rooney leave the pitch for treatment to a bloody wound near his left eye after an aerial duel with Bournemouthâ€™s Simon Francis. There were few chances in the opening 45 minutes but just after the break Norway international King latched on to a pass from Charlie Daniels before driving diagonally towards the penalty area and rifling the ball home. Everton poured forward and Niasse, who replaced Rooney in the 55th minute, expertly controlled a pass from Tom Davies and slammed the ball into the net before bundling home a second five minutes later to give his side a much-needed win.
