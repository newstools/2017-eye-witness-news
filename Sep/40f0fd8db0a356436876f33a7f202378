JOHANNESBURG - South Africa batsman JP Duminy has decided to quit test cricket but will continue to feature in the shorter formats of the game, the 33-year-old said in a statement on Saturday. After long and careful deliberation, I have decided to retire from first-class and test match cricket with immediate effect, the left-hander, who scored 2,103 runs in 46 tests, said. It is an experience that cannot be replaced and one I will always cherish. Test cricket has always been the pinnacle and I ve been fortunate enough to experience some memorable highlights with the Proteas and also in first-class matches with the WSB Cape Cobras. Duminy, who also bowls off-spin, made his test debut in 2008 against Australia in Perth. In the years ahead, my focus will be placed on attaining limited-overs cricket success for South Africa and the WSB Cape Cobras... he added.
