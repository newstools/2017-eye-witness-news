Lebo Mathuloe died on Monday after sustaining several stab wounds at the Pecanwood Estate, near the Hartbeespoort Dam. JOHANNESBURG - North West police are calling for information on the death of a young woman in Hartbeespoort. Lebo Mathuloe died on Monday after sustaining several stab wounds at the Pecanwood Estate, near the Hartbeespoort Dam. Police say it doesn’t appear likely that Mathuloe was killed by her partner, but a post-mortem will be carried out to determine the exact cause of death. An inquest has been opened into Mathuloe's death. Spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone says: “According to the information that we have, the victim allegedly stabbed herself several times with a knife. Hence, we’re investigating the matter. In case someone has new information that may suggest otherwise, they're more than free to come and see the investigating officer.” Social media was abuzz with suggestions that the deceased has been killed by her boyfriend, with some trying to link Mathuloe to soccer coach Gavin Hunt after a Whatsapp screengrab of the two of them made the rounds.  Hunt has since moved to clarify that he was not in a romantic relationship with the model.  In a press statement released on Wednesday, the Pecanwood Home Owners Association (HOA) says eyewitnesses reported Mathuloe had been waiting for her parents in the estate’s clubhouse when she allegedly stabbed herself. The association says the young model was found in an incoherent and "highly upset state" when she was taken to the association’s office upon her own request. The HOA further extends its condolences to Mathuloe’s family and confirms that its security is working together with the local police to probe the matter. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
