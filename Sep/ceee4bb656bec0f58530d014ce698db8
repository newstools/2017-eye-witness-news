Seven-year-old Ezra Daniels was caught in the crossfire while playing outside his home on Sunday. CAPE TOWN - A Grassy Park mother whose young son was killed in an apparent gang shooting says she’s dealing with her child's death one day at a time. Seven-year-old Ezra Daniels was caught in the crossfire while playing outside his home on Sunday. Desire Daniels says that her family is still trying to come to terms with her son’s tragic death. “We’re very sad and still trying to deal with it… it won’t be done in one day, we’re taking it step by step.” She says authorities have failed to take action in a community marred by gang violence. Four suspects arrested in connection with the seven-year-old's murder are due in court this week. The Grassy Park Community Policing Forum says the current situation in the area calls for drastic action and the forum has demanded that guns be removed from the streets. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
