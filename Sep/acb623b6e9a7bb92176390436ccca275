                                         CAPE TOWN - The MK Inkululeko Foundation has demanded billionaire Johann Rupert  retract a statement he made at Richemont's annual general meeting in Geneva. Rupert reportedly described the African National Congress' (ANC) policy on radical economic transformation as "just a code word for theft". On Friday, dozens of members of the ANC Youth League, Black First Land First, and  the  MK Inkululeko Foundation marched to Remgro Limited's offices. The demonstrators even damaged Unilever products as a sign of further protest. Rupert is the chairman of the Swiss-based luxury-goods company Richemont and of investment company Remgro, which has a stake in Unilever. The foundation's Sparks Motseki has called on Rupert to retract his statement. “It’s not conducive to a positive socio-economic transformation that is desperately needed in South Africa. It’s divisive and undermines government efforts to redress inequalities and injustices. It’s against the spirit of ubuntu.”
