                                         CAPE TOWN - It's come to light that another state-owned entity enlisted Trillian Capital Partners, the financial consultants linked to the Gupta family. In a written response to a Parliamentary question, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has revealed that South African Express paid the company more than R5 million for work done in 2016. It's been revealed Trillian was paid millions by Eskom, despite earlier denials from Brown. In response to a written question from the DA's Natasha Mazzone, it's been revealed Trillian was paid R5.7 million by SA Express in 2016, for "a funding plan and balance sheet optimisation." According to Brown, the payment was approved by the CEO and the chief financial officer. Mazzone says the revelation points to the extent of state capture. “That’s just a slap in the face of all hardworking South Africa, certainly all employees at SA Express who literally go day to day not knowing if they’re going to have a job in six months’ time.” In the same response, Brown revealed that the airline paid another consultancy firm, Regiments, R8 million over three years - also for a funding plan and balance sheet optimisation. Mazzone says she will be asking for SA Express to present these funding plans to Parliament and for the board to explain why they were commissioned.
