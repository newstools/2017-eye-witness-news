                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police say a preliminary post-mortem report into the death of a 13-year-old Benoni boy contains no information to support claims that he died from injuries sustained while fighting off bullies. The grade seven pupil and his elder brother are understood to have been targeted several times at an East Rand school. He died at his home last week. The police's Mack Mngomezulu says despite the findings contained in the preliminary post-mortem report, their investigation will continue. He says authorities are assessing whether charges should still be brought against the teenager’s alleged attackers. “When they have concluded the investigation then they will take the docket to inquest court for a decision The police will do all the necessary processes, including getting statements from nurses and the siblings as well."  Last week Gauteng community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane visited the school and told pupils about the dangers of bullying. (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
