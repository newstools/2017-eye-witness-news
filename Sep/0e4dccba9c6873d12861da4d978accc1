                                         JOHANNESBURG – Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says that it is undesirable for the court to deal with too many political cases, saying that this throws the judiciary in the middle of the political space. Mogoeng spoke to Radio 702 on Monday where he once again expressed concerns about attacks on the judiciary by some political leaders. Despite the judiciary meeting with President Jacob Zuma to discuss the issue two years ago, criticism has continued. Earlier this year, National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete accused some judges of not being impartial when it comes to the African National Congress (ANC). The chief justice says that criticism from political leaders must be factual. "We don’t mind when people criticise us but let it be factual, let it move from an informed basis." He admits that a challenge is created when political cases are brought before the courts frequently. "Because it throws the judiciary right in the middle of the political space and then attracting unfortunate consequences." The chief justice called has called on the leaders to be constructive in their criticism, saying that the judiciary is not perfect.
