The 31-year-old, ranked 32 in the world, is the lowest-ranked grand slam finalist since 38th-ranked Jo-Wilfried Tsonga fell at the 2008 Australian Open final. NEW YORK Big-serving South African Kevin Anderson battled back to defeat 12th seeded Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 and punch his ticket to his first grand slam final at the U.S. Open on Friday.Anderson, who in the absence of world number two Andy Murray benefited from a favourable draw, will face either world number one Rafa Nadal or Argentine Juan Martin del Potro in Sunday s final.The 6ft 8in (2.03m) Anderson climbed into his player s box to embrace his wife, brother and coach Neville Godwin after Carreno Busta s forehand found the net to finish the nearly three-hour contest. I don t know if the team hug is appropriate before the final but it felt like the right thing to do, Anderson told the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium. It s been a long road, added the South African, who overcame a right hip injury last year that had threatened his 2017 campaign.The 31-year-old, ranked 32 in the world, is the lowest-ranked grand slam finalist since 38th-ranked Jo-Wilfried Tsonga fell at the 2008 Australian Open final.Anderson was out of sorts to begin with. He hit 14 unforced errors including a backhand that sailed long to hand the composed Carreno Busta a rare break to go up 4-3 in the first set.The Spaniard closed it out but Anderson settled down after a see-sawing second set and delivered his 20th ace, a 132 mile per hour bullet, to take the third.The South African s power eventually wore down the 26-year-old Carreno Busta, who had not dropped a set in the tournament prior to the match.
