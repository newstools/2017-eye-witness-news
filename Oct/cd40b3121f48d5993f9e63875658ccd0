                                         CAPE TOWN - Philippi East  residents blame the absence of youth programs for escalating crime in the community. Western Cape Community Safety MEC Dan Plato is for a second day visiting the community following shootings that left 11 people dead over the weekend. Plato will on Monday afternoon visit families who may need to be assisted with funeral arrangements. Residents say they've in the past highlighted issues with regard to police inefficiency. Following this weekend's shootings, residents are even more fearful. “The situation is tense here, the community is in a panic mode because nobody knows what’s going to happen next. “Now we need the intervention of the police, Mbalula himself he must come and intervene in this matter.” Plato says he met with some residents this morning and many are crying out for initiatives to keep young people occupied. “The youngsters, according to them (community), are running amok in this community and they’ve asked government to step in, to come in with projects, to come in with programmes to assist the youth.” A heightened police presence is visible in the community. #PhilippiShootings WC Community Safety MEC Dan Plato is scheduled to meet with community leaders at Philippi Police Station @BrandtKev pic.twitter.com/9SNKu0j4UQ
