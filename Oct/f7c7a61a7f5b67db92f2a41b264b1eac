                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Policing Union (Sapu) and the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) say they're now preparing for legal action against the SAPS. 10111 workers affiliated to Sapu have announced a march to the Union Buildings on 16 October. It has raised serious objections to an agreement signed with the police and Popcru declaring call centres an essential service. Saftu General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says government and the SAPS have been far too slow to respond to the demands of 10111 workers. “They do not care. They day one or two taxis get burnt, it’s hullabaloo, headlines and the minister walking in the streets.” Vavi says Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula won’t even take his calls anymore. “Will our politicians care? No. They serve the interests of the elites in society.” He says the demands of workers are simple: they want to be moved from a level 5 to a level 7 salary grading.
