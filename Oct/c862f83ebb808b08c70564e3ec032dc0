                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says it condemns what it calls the arrogant and offensive display of the apartheid flag during Mondayâ€™s #BlackMonday campaign. Thousands of people from the farming community dressed in black gathered across the country to spread awareness about farm killings. However, some protesters were seen displaying the old apartheid flag and singing the old anthem. The ANC says that apart from white farmers being killed, black farm workers are also victims of murder and therefore the farming community should appreciate the importance of all lives.  The governing party says that the display of the old apartheid flag is evident of an unrelenting yearning for white supremacy.  It says some elements in the campaign racially characterise crime and mock the national reconciliation project.  Organisers of the campaign AfriForum on Monday distanced themselves from protesters seen carrying the flags, saying they were not its members.  The ANC says that AfriForum should join the rest of South Africa to fight all forms of crime. WATCH: #BlackMonday: Protests against farm murders  (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
