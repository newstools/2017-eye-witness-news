                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng provincial government has once against reiterated that Premier David Makhura was never involved in a decision to transfer the mental health patients from Life Esidimeni. The provincial government says its noted media reports raising questions about the conduct of the premier in relation to the tragedy. Spokesperson Thabo Masebe said: “Premier David Makhura will appear before the ADR processes. He will testify before Justice Moseneke and will be able to answer any question that any affected party may have about his conduct.” The Democratic Alliance (DA) has questioned Makhura's  role in the transfer of Esidimeni patients. This follows former Mental Health Review Board director Dumazile Masondo’s claims at the Esidimeni arbitration hearings that Makhura had attended meetings on the move of the patients. She also claimed that former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu told her she was “getting orders from above” on the Esidimeni project. The DA says this flatly contradicts Makhura's claim that he didn’t know that the patients were sent to non-governmental organisations but were going to other state health facilities.
