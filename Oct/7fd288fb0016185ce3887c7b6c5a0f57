                                         JOHANNESBURG - Fuel price increases will go into effect from midnight.  Prices for 93 and 95 octane petrol will go up by four cents per litre. Illuminating paraffin by 21 cents while motorists will pay between 23 and 27 cents more for diesel. The energy department made the announcement on Sunday, saying that a weakening rand contributed to the price hikes. Meanwhile, the Automobile Association of South Africa is warning of a major fuel price increase before Christmas. The AA believes the pending fuel price hike is linked to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba's medium-term budget policy statement, which he delivered last week. AA spokesperson Layton Beard explains: "We believe fuel prices have not yet felt the full effect of the rand’s weakening in the wake of the medium-term budget policy statement. We expect that impact to start with next month’s fuel calculations, meaning South Africans should prepare for further price hikes before Christmas.”
