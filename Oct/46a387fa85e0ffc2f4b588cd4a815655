                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Esidimeni arbitration process has heard of the desperate lengths relatives went to to find out why their loved ones were so ill, with one man testifying that he locked staff from an illegal NGO inside an office. Hundreds of mentally ill patients were moved from Life Esidimeni facilities between March and June last year and taken to unlawful facilities by the Gauteng Health Department. One-hundred-and-forty-one of them died as a result of the move. At least 10 family members have testified so far and the hearing is expecting to hear from another 10 before it wraps up. The majority of the family members say they were either not told about their loved ones being moved until a few weeks later or were told about the transfer but were not given a forwarding address. Lesiba Leroabe, whose brother Mothofela is among those who died, says he even staged a sit-in at the NGO where his brother was taken demanding to know why he looked so sick. “Chief Justice let me be honest, I took the keys of the office and put them inside my pocket in order to make sure that nobody leaves.” Lucas Mogoerane, who also lost his brother Christopher, has described him as a confident person. “When the other piece is no more, I’m not in the fullest of a human being.” Meanwhile, the hearings heard earlier on Tuesday that former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu is willing to testify but has asked to complete her exams in London first before a date can be confirmed.
