                                         CAPE TOWN - Opposition parties say a plan by the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to again outsource grant payments is suspicious. Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini  on Monday announced tenders will be issued on Friday for services the Post Bank  can't provide. But opposition parties don't believe negotiations have taken place in good faith. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) believe the Post Bank is able to play a greater role in the payment of grants than Sassa says it can. The IFP's Liezl van der Merwe said: “Somebody is not telling truth. And in fact, one should also be concerned about the process because the evaluation was done by a Sassa team and not an independent team.” The DA’s Bridget Masango said: “I don’t think it’s a fair assessment, I also don’t think the Post Office has been given a platform to actually present both what they were asked by Sassa and how they responded to it.” The Post Bank has until Tuesday to accept an offer from Sassa to provide a payment system and biometric services.
