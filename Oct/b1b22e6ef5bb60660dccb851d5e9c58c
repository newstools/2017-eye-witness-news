                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police are investigating the authenticity of a voice note being circulated on WhatsApp of a man claiming that a security union will hold mass protests against white people in South Africa later this week. In the voice note, a man calling himself "Pastor Andre" translates a message purportedly calling for the killing of white South Africans in response to Monday’s Black Monday demonstrations. The police ministry's Vuyo Mhaga said: “We’ve received the voice note and we’re investigating its authenticity. We want to tell South Africans not to panic, the police will be on alert.” Meanwhile, the Police Ministry has criticised protests held across the country in support of farmers, which saw traffic disrupted and some matrics not able to write exams. Thousands of farmers and supporters participated in the national Black Monday campaign aimed at highlighting the number of attacks and killings involving farmers. Black Monday supporters also criticised the government for not doing enough to ensure the safety of farmers. WATCH: #BlackMonday: Protests against farm murders  Additional reporting by Mia Lindeque.
