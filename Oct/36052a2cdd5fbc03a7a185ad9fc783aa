                                         JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties Congress of the People (Cope), United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have argued that the remedial action, directing President Jacob Zuma to establish a state capture Commission of Inquiry was lawful and appropriate considering Zuma himself is implicated in wrongdoing. The president has taken the Public Protector’s State of Capture remedial action on review in Pretoria on Tuesday. Zuma has argued that the binding action amounts to a breach of the principle of the separation of powers. EFF advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi argues that the court should not allow President Zuma to be judge and jury in his own case. “All is the correct way, the more Constitutionally compliant way of dealing with it - that the power of the president to appoint without constraints itself needs to be restrained… that he is only required to appoint the person as selected by the chief justice.” The UDM and Cope’s advocate Dali Mpofu stressed the importance of this case. “It can never get worse than state capture... the state, the whole state captured. It can never get worse than the head of that state being implicated.” Mpofu will continue on Wednesday, while the Democratic Alliance is also expected present its case. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
