                                         JOHANNESBURG – The cultural pride group Indoni says it’s concerned and feel bullied by Facebook and Instagram by removing their pictures which show young women in cultural attires with their breasts being exposed. It says this is an insult to African cultures by removing and flagging some pictures claiming they are promoting pornography and nudity. In African cultures, exposing women breasts is not seen as being naked as it is in western cultures. Indoni says Facebook and Instagram have been removing their pictures for four years now saying they are offensive and violating their terms. Indoni has now created an awareness to promote different cultures and call on various social media platforms to stop deleting their photos and blocking their accounts.  Founder and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Nomcebo Mthembu says: “We won’t let us to be told by western society how we as black people should be black. We shouldn’t be told ‘if you are black you should be confined to this terms; these are the terms to being black’. We can’t do that, we should tell the world who we are.”
