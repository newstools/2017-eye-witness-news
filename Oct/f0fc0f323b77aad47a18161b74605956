The latest suicide bombing is coming four months after the last incident which killed 17 persons. In what appears to be a coordinated attack, Borno state Police Commissioner, Damian Chukwu, confirmed a male suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in a crowded area, killing 13 people and wounding five others. He said two other female suicide bombers also detonated Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) strapped to their bodies and injured 13 persons, all within Maiduguri, in Borno state. The injured persons were referred to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital from the scene of the explosions. Borno state, which has suffered the most attacks from Boko Haram, has witnessed not less than 13 suicide bomb attacks this year at Muna area.
