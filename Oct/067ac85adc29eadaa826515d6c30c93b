                                         CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) MP who’s been a driving force behind Parliament's probe into Eskom, will continue chairing the inquiry when it resumes on Tuesday. As the acting chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, Zukiswa Rantho, tenaciously led lawmakers to secure resources and an experienced evidence leader for the inquiry. But just days after the probe began, the ANC announced she was being replaced as the committee's chairperson. The ANC Chief Whip’s announcement last week that National Executive Committee Member Lungi Mnganga-Gcabashe would replace Rantho came as a surprise to many Members of Parliament. Mnganga-Gcabashe has since taken over the chairperson’s position, but she will not be leading the inquiry. Rantho says that remains her job. “Because I started the inquiry as the acting chairperson of the committee, so the ANC in Parliament said I must continue.” The committee is the only one of four, tasked with investigating allegations of state capture, to have made some progress.
