                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Council for the Advancement of South African Constitution (Casac) is calling for Parliament to exercise its constitutional powers to remove National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams. This follows the Supreme Court of Appeal's decision to dismiss the appeals by President Jacob Zuma and the NPA to withdraw the 783 corruption charges against the president. Casac says the suitability of Abrahams to continue to hold office as the National Director of Public Prosecutions must now be seriously questioned. It says Abrahams’ tenure continues to bring the NPA into disrepute. Casac’s Lawson Naidoo said: “We should all be treated by the NPA without fear, favour or prejudice and I think this is rally calling into question the independence of the NPA and in particular the independence of Advocate Abrahams.” WATCH: 'Abrahams must commit to reinstating all Zuma charges'
