                                         JOHANNESBURG – Social media has reacted with mixed emotions following the news that the Nigerian government unveiled a statue of President Jacob Zuma on Sunday. Zuma was awarded the highest honour during a visit to Nigeria’s Imo State at the weekend. A street has also been named after him. However, the professionals' group says the statue is not beneficial to Nigerians and the money could have been used for something else. The group’s Adetunuji Omotolo says: “We don’t even have a statue of Nelson Mandela, we don’t have a statue of Barack Obama, we don’t have a statue of Martin Luther King, all the great black icons. “We don’t have them anywhere in Nigeria and now we have the statue of president Zuma. It’s not the best PR exercise, if you ask me.”      The state governor also conferred on President Zuma the Imo Merit Award which is the highest award in the state conferred on distinguished personalities who have made a difference in the development of their communities. President Zuma held discussions with DRC President Joseph Kabila Kabange on Sunday on the issues of peace and security. He visited the country as the chairperson of SADC to assist the government and the people of the DRC to achieve sustainable peace, security and stability.
