                                         CAPE TOWN - The SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the SA Post Office (Sapo) are meeting on Tuesday afternoon to try and break a deadlock related to the payment of social grants. The Post Office says it’s not prepared to accept an offer that will only see it provide a payment system. But Sassa says it’s bound by the finding of its bid adjudication committee that doesn’t allow it to offer the Post Office the full contract. Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini told a joint meeting of two parliamentary committees on Tuesday that she was committed to working with the Post Office. A commitment to work together, but no common ground. Post office chief executive Mark Barnes says there’s been a misunderstanding about the full extent of services the Post Bank can provide. “Let us delve into the reality of what Sapo can deliver, let’s see if that can assist in the efficient payment of social grants and retain capital in the fiscus.” Dlamini says she believes the deadlock can be broken. “If they don’t find a solution they must sit right through the night.” Officials have agreed to return to Parliament on Wednesday night to provide feedback on their negotiations.
