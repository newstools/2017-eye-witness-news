                                         CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Lindiwe Sisulu says the ruling party is ready to be led by a woman. Sisulu spoke to Western Cape supporters on Saturday night as part of the ANC’s Walter Sisulu Branch’s Centenary of Oliver Tambo. She also stressed the importance of the ruling party reviving itself ahead of the 2019 national elections. Enthusiastic supporters filled the Everite Community Hall in Kraaifontein in the northern suburbs of Cape Town on Saturday night to hear ANC NEC Sisulu.  She responded to Gwede Mantashe’s tweets stating that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should succeed President Jacob Zuma. “Women are very strong people, who are capable of uniting people and empathy.” Sisulu also feels the ANC should expedite dealing with the revelations that have emerged in the leaked emails from the Gupta family’s businesses. “With regards to the issue of the Gupta leaks, the ANC disciplinary committee must look into it before we hand it over to the court.” She says the ruling party should own up to its mistakes and use the December elective conference to correct past mistakes.
