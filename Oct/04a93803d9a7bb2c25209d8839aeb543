                                         ZIMBABWE - Tensions within Zimbabwe’s ruling party have escalated, with first lady Grace Mugabe publicly rebuking Zimbabwe's Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The first lady said the vice president’s continued claims that he recently survived poisoning were nonsensical. Mugabe made the remarks at the launch of a youth empowerment bank on Thursday. In comments carried by state media on Thursday, she said Mnangagwa was playing a dangerous game by continuing to insist he was poisoned at a rally in August. The first lady said she had no reason to kill the vice president, calling him a mere “employee” of her husband. Mnangagwa and the first lady are said to be in different factions vying for control of the ruling party. At a press conference on Thursday night, Mnangagwa said his loyalty to the president was unflinching. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
