                                         CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says its law enforcement agencies will continue to assist the police in ensuring visibility in a Philippi community. Eleven people were killed in two separate shootings in the area about a week ago. Seven others were also gunned down in neighbouring Nyanga. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith accompanied metro police in a patrol in the Marikana informal settlement on Saturday. Smith says they've engaged with residents who expressed their ongoing fear of violent crimes being committed in the township. “The reality is that people are living in absolute fear. We are told that criminals kick open doors and rape women in front of their families. The situation is completely out of control.” Police Minister Fikile Mbalula held an imbizo in the community earlier this week, where he promised to resolve the complaints with regards to police inefficiency in the area.
