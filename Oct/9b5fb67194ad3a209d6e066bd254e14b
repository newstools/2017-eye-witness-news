                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police in De Deur, south of Johannesburg, say forensic pathologists have confirmed that the bodies of three men found mutilated on the side of the road were mauled by an animal. Police have been trying to establish the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the men after residents found their bodies over five days three weeks ago.  While community members had earlier testified to have seen dogs dragging one of the bodies, police say their tests have found this to be improbable. The police's colonel Bonny Molefi says although there are still many unanswered questions about what kind of animal killed the three men and why there was no blood at the different scenes, they are one step closer to the truth. “The death was caused by an unknown animal, he can’t say which animal killed them.” Meanwhile, community members say there have been more murders in the area. However, police say no bodies have been found to support these allegations. Molefi couldn’t confirm suspicions that the men may have been killed by hyenas as reported by one of the families, saying there was no way to prove this. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
