                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) says South Africans need to hold President Jacob Zuma  liable for plunging the SABC into a governance vacuum. The party has called on the president to urgently approve the new board which was recommended by Parliament. At the same time, the Presidency has said it understands the urgency but the president is still considering suitable candidates. SACP spokesperson Alex Mashilo says they have no idea what is behind the delay. “The SABC has experienced government decay and is currently bankrupt. You cannot allow an institution of that magnitude to be without a governance authority.”
