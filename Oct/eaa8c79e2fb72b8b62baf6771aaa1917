                                         JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane says calls to fight women and children abuse is being ignored by some. A video showing a woman being assaulted and handcuffed after her three-year-old daughter allegedly relieved herself outside the Usave Shoprite in Cosmo City has gone viral on social media, angering many. The incident on Saturday included private security guards dragging the woman on the floor and insulting her in front of her child. The MEC visited the victim and met with the store management, investigating officers, and private security management. Thandi Shaparadzo says while she was left traumatised and humiliated by the assault, she is more concerned about her daughter who witnessed the incident. “I’m so devastated. I don’t know how some people, especially security, they really want to act like they’re the police. Even the police wouldn’t treat you like that.” Nkosi-Malobane says the guards acted out malice and unnecessary anger. “Educating our people about crimes that are being committed against children, and it seems to some people it falls on deaf eyes.” The victim and her daughter will be receiving counselling and police are investigating.
