                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation is hosting a centenary commemoration lecture on Friday evening where a keynote address will be given by former President Thabo Mbeki. Festivities kicked off on Friday at Wit University to mark the day that former African National Congress leader OR Tambo would have turned 100. The foundation says guests expected to attend the lecture include George Bizos and retired Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke. Project manager Natasha Allie said: “The foundation was set up by the children of Oliver and Adelaide Tambo. They are trustees, so it's basically a family event. Former president Mbeki was OR Tambo’s right-hand man and almost a son to him… I think it’s a very special event.”  WATCH: Nkantolo Village celebrates OR Tambo  LISTEN: OR Tambo’s role in SA’s history  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
