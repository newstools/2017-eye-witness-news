                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Institute for Security Studies (ISS) says it's difficult to comment on the farm murder statistic reported by AfriForum, as murder statistics in South Africa are not adequately categorised. AfriForum claims there were 70 murders and 357 attacks on farms so far this year. But the ISS’s Gareth Newham says there are no reliable crime statistics for a range of sub-categories of murder. “There were over 19,000 murders reported to the police last year and we don’t receive any further breakdown as to who those people were. Different organisations keep data on what they see as murders and that might differ on the crime statistics.” Three people were arrested and released on a warning after blocking the N1 highway during the Pretoria leg of Monday’s protests against farm murders.
