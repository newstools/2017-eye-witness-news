                                         PRETORIA - While the Presidency has confirmed President Jacob Zuma is once again a suspected criminal, it's revealed he’ll be pinning his hopes on prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams  by making fresh representations on why he should not go to trial. The Supreme Court dismissed Zuma  and the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) application to appeal the High Court ruling which set aside the 2009 decision to discontinue the prosecution. The court accepted the parties’ concession that former NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe relied on an incorrect provision in the law, which meant they had no case. The Presidency says the Supreme Court’s ruling means the only legitimate decision made by the NPA is the one to prosecute Zuma. But it adds that this also means that the representations have also not been considered. The Presidency says it expects Abrahams to consider submissions from the president and make a legitimate decision. Zuma is expected to rely on recent revelations that the KPMG report used in Schabir Shaik’s trail is flawed. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance says it will be writing to Abrahams to establish when the NPA will serve a new indictment on the president.
