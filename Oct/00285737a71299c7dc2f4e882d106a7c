                                         CAPE TOWN - Trade unions are questioning why Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba wants to launch a forensic investigation into the Public Investment Corporation (PIC). SA Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi told Parliament’s Finance Committee on Tuesday that he believed Gigaba is going on a fishing expedition to try and discredit PIC chief executive Dan Matjila. Gigaba announced last week that all investments over the past two years are to be probed. Matjila told the committee on Tuesday that the PIC was close to disclosing information about its unlisted investments. Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) says that it doesn’t understand the rationale behind the planned forensic audit of the PIC’s investments. The terms of reference for the probe are to be submitted to Gigaba by Monday.  But Saftu’s Zwelinzima Vavi says he believes there’s another agenda at play. “It’s not just a fishing expedition, he’s trying to find a reason to suspend the current CEO in order to find another blue-eyed boy from Saxonwold.” Meanwhile, board chairperson of the Government Employees Pension Fund, Renosi Mokate, says the board will meet soon to discuss potential attempts to illegally access members’ funds.
