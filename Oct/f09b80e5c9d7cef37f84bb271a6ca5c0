                                         JOHANNESBURG – Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says if the African National Congress (ANC) follows its tradition with regards to its succession battle, political killings will stop. Ntshalintshali says factions originated because the ANC has deviated from the practice where the deputy president automatically succeeds the president.  He says if the ANC doesn’t want Cyril Ramaphosa to take over the party’s presidency, they must put forward a vote of no confidence against him now.  Ntshalintshali says they have been accused of hating President Jacob Zuma but he denies this.  “When you put your hands in the till or you allow other people, then that confidence is gone out through the window.”  He says the more the ANC fails to make a decisive announcement on the principle behind the succession race, more people are at risk of being killed.
