                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape government and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries are continuing to work around the clock to find solutions following the bird flu outbreak. The number of confirmed cases of avian influenza in the Western Cape has risen to 50.  At least 2.5 million chickens and ducks have been culled since an outbreak of bird flu occurred in the Cape.  According to the South African Poultry Association, at least eight out of 10 egg producers in the Western Cape have been affected by bird flu. Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde says that they’re in talks. “We’re negotiating with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to talk about the possible compensation and how we can deal with this disease, particularly the inoculation process.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
