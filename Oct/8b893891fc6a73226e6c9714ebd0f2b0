A video showing a minibus taxi stuck in a ditch and surrounded by a strong current of water while its occupants struggle to escape has been circulating on South African social media in the wake of a huge storm in Durban. This is doing the rounds on WhatsApp - is it really from #DurbanStorm today? pic.twitter.com/Y8h1lNfKH0  From what Africa Check could gather, the video has been posted before, and so cannot be of the Durban storm on 10 October 2017. The earliest version we’ve found was posted on 25 July 2017. In this instance, the video is said to have originated in Ethiopia. This same video was shared on South Africa Live‘s Facebook page on 27 July 2017 (though without an indication of where the incident had taken place) and again on YouTube in relation to Hurricane Irma on 14 September 2017.
