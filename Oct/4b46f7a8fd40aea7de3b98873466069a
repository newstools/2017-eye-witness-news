                                         DURBAN – African National Congress (ANC) leaders in KwaZulu-Natal will spend a second day fielding questions at the Moerane Commission of Inquiry. The delegation gave a presentation on Thursday on the history of violence in the country while appearing before the commission tasked with probing the cause of political killings in KZN. Disputed provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala says that while the ANC has been most affected by the violence, the killings are part of a bigger societal problem. Zikalala has blamed the fighting in his province on a number of factors including colonialism and apartheid. “Thus, anything that affects human beings in KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa is largely to affect the ANC because of its own majority within the populace of the country and the province.”
