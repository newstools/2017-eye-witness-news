                                         CAPE TOWN - Whether you are a banter or a baker, a looming egg shortage could affect you amid an outbreak of bird flu. The South African Poultry Association says that retailers may already be struggling with supply. Since the outbreak in June, 79 H5N8 cases have been reported nationwide, with 49 in the Western Cape. The Poultry Association's Achmad Brinkhuis says that about eight in 10 Western Cape egg producers have been affected by avian influenza. He warns this will most likely affect prices in the province. "If the demand is there and the supply is not, the prices will obviously go up but it depends on the retailers themselves." Brinkhuis says that discussions with government around compensation for affected farmers are at "a sensitive stage". He adds that producers want poultry vaccinated but admits this will have implications on trade.
