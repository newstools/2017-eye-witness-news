                                         JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has told Eyewitness News that the Gauteng ANC was wrong to give guidelines to branches on how to make their nominations for the party's leadership positions. The Gauteng provincial executive committee (PEC) recently decided at its general assembly to back deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa for the position of ANC president.  It sent a letter to its branches listing several names and guiding them on who to nominate. Earlier this year, the ANC introduced a new way of nominating leaders for positions to fight slate politics and tighten the party's electoral processes. Unlike previously, the party's provinces will not consolidate the nominations for leadership coming from branches, but they will go directly to the party's national electoral commission. Gwede Mantashe has taken issue with the Gauteng ANC guiding branches on how to make their nominations. “No, they can’t tell them how to nominate.” He says that the provincial leadership must only observe the process and not interfere.
