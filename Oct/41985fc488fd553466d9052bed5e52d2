                                         JOHANNESBURG - The death toll in the Esidimeni tragedy actually stands at 141 and not 118. This has been confirmed by the Gauteng Health Department’s acting head of department Dr Ernest Kenoshi, who is testifying before the arbitration process in Parktown on Friday. He is the State’s fifth witness. Kenoshi was appointed to his position on 8 February this year after the Health Ombudsman’s report into Esidimeni was released. He says that between then and the end of last month, 23 former Life Esidimeni patients died. Kenoshi says that autopsy results show that these patients died of natural causes at state hospitals they were taken to. Earlier this week, Professor Malegapuru Makgoba confirmed 118 deaths between October last year and February this year, which now means that the Esidimeni death toll stands at 141.
