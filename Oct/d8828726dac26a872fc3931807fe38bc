                                         JOHANNESBURG – The mother of a mentally ill man who was allegedly beaten to death by Red Ants in Midvaal is demanding answers from the Security Company, claiming he was not part of the R59 protest. Last week, Midvaal Mayor Bongani Baloyi used the Red Ants to deal with protesters barricading the busy highway in Meyerton, claiming the police are not doing their job. The Sicelo community is demanding land and proper houses which have led to the R59 being closed for almost three months. Meisie Mira says her 32-year-old metally ill son, Mpho, was a good man and was minding his own business when a Red Ants security guard attacked him. “No, he was just passing by. He was coming from the shops. He used to help the police at the police station sometimes.” The family is now demanding that Baloyi pays for Mpho’s burial and tombstone. His aunt Sarah Motloung says the family is still very angry. “Our brother died like a dog. They beat him until he died. We want to bury him and he must rest in peace.” The highway remains closed while residents continue with their shutdown of the provincial road to force the government to listen to their demands.
