Officers are investigating incidents reported to have taken place between the 1980s and 2015 in London and outside Britain. LONDON - British police are looking into allegations of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein from seven women, the BBC reported on Tuesday. The BBC said officers were investigating incidents reported to have taken place between the 1980s and 2015 in London and outside Britain. Londonâ€™s Metropolitan Police said it could not comment. Weinstein is at the centre of a growing international scandal about sexual harassment. Dozens of women, many of them actresses who encountered Weinstein in what was supposed to be a professional capacity, have come forward with allegations against him of behaviour ranging from persistent unwanted advances to rape. He denies allegations of non-consensual sex. The Guardian newspaper had reported on 12 October that British police were investigating Weinstein for alleged sex crimes. As is standard procedure in Britain, the police confirmed an allegation had been received and would be assessed, but did not identify the person involved. In the United States, police in New York and Los Angeles have said they were investigating allegations of sexual assault against Weinstein. In Britain, police are under an obligation to investigate certain types of allegations if they receive them. The 65-year-old disgraced producer stands accused of sexually harassing over 40 women in a 30-year period. Since the sexual assault claims were first reported, Weinstein has been fired by The Weinstein Company and his wife of 10 years, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, has announced she will be leaving him.
