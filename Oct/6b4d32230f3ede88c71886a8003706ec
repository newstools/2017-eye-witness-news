                                         PRETORIA – Home Affairs Director General Mkuseli Apleni’s legal teams says they will challenge Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize’s claims that he is unstable and delusional when the matter is finally heard in court. Apleni is asking the High Court in Pretoria to declare that the minister does not have the authority to suspend directors general because that power had not been delegated. Mkhize suspended Apleni last month on grounds of gross misconduct but he says she wants him out of the way in order to reach questionable deals in disputes involving the department. The matter was scheduled out be heard on Tuesday but the judge asked that it be assigned to someone else. Apleni’s attorney SJ Thema says they have filed a supplementary affidavit specifically to deal with Mkhize’s utterances. But he says it’s unfortunate the minister has not filed an affidavit herself. A senior Home Affairs official has filed one instead. “We’re hoping, with the special allocation with a judge dedicated to this matter that would give the minister an opportunity to file an affidavit answering to the allegations that are made in our founding papers.” The parties will find out on Thursday when the matter will be heard.
