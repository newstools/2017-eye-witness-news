                                            RBPlat, a black-owned mid-tier producer of the precious metal, is the latest South African company to cut ties with companies linked to the Guptas.
                                         JOHANNESBURG - South African platinum producer Royal Bafokeng Platinum said on Thursday it was dropping the services of contractor JIC Mining Services, majority by Oakbay Investments, the main company operated by the Gupta family. RBPlat, a black-owned mid-tier producer of the precious metal, is the latest South African company to cut ties with companies linked to the Guptas, accused of using their friendship with President Jacob Zuma to win state contracts. The Gupta family and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing. “It was a commercial decision, with effect from 31 December. Notice period began at the beginning of October. The agreement between the parties entitles the company to terminate for convenience,” a spokeswoman for RBPlat told Reuters in response to emailed questions.
