                                         DURBAN – A friend of late African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) leader Sindiso Magaqa is giving testimony at the Moerane Commission of Inquiry on Wednesday. The hearings are investigating the underlying causes of political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. The Umzimkhulu Municipality has become the subject of scrutiny as the possible reason behind Magaqa’s attack in July because he planned to expose alleged corruption there.  During Magaqa's memorial, Thabiso Zulu told mourners that the former ANCYL leader had evidence to prove that there was corruption in the multi-million rand tender meant for the refurbishing of the Umzimkhulu Memorial Hall. Magaqa is said to have given documents to Zulu, proving that the cost for the project had been overinflated. At the same time, the Public Protector’s office has also launched its own investigation and has halted all spending on the project until further notice. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
