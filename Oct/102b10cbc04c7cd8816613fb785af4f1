                                         JOHANNESBURG - Disciplinary hearings against suspended Eskom  executive Matshela Koko have been delayed due to the availability of the appointed chairperson of the hearing. Koko's hearing was due to start underway on Monday. Koko was suspended for failing to declare a conflict of interest while awarding a multi-million-rand contract to a company his step-daughter was involved in. Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe says the various parties will decide on a time to continue the hearing. “The parties involved will speak to each other about their availability including the chairperson of the hearing, and once every one is comfortable about the availability, then they will share that information.” It's also been confirmed that the media will be allowed to attend the hearing.
