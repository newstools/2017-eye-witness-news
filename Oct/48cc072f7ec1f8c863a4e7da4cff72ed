                                         PRETORIA - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)'s legal team has argued that President Jacob Zuma can't rationally exercise his power to institute a state capture commission of inquiry because he is personally implicated in the investigation. Zuma has asked the High Court in Pretoria to set aside the state of capture remedial action, which instructs him to appoint a commission but led by a judge appointed by the chief justice. The president has argued that these provisions offend the principle of a separation of powers. EFF Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi says the law requires that power be exercised rationally, which is why President Zuma cannot decide himself how the commission of inquiry is established. “It is impossible to conceive of a rational appointment of this commission of inquiry being made by the same person who is the subject of the investigation.” He says the inclusion of the chief justice was to avoid a conflict of interest. “The president said: ‘I do not want to be seen to be a judge and jury in my own case.’” Zuma’s legal team has argued that the remedial action is invalid because the Public Protector concedes she made no findings of fact in her investigation.
