                                         PRETORIA - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has wished the African National Congress (ANC) well as it heads towards its elective conference in December. Mugabe gave his welcoming remarks at the second session of the South Africa-Zimbabwe binational commission  in Pretoria earlier on Tuesday. As the ANC steps closer to its national elective conference-tensions have increased in the party, with political killings in some provinces, violence at conferences in others, and court cases disputing the legitimacy of the party's gatherings. The upcoming conference has also caused divisions not only at the ANC’S highest leadership structure but among members on the ground too. Mugabe seemed to be aware of this as he wished the party well. “We wish ANC every success at the congress. So that it can continue into the future renewed and strengthened.” He says he recently spoke about the ANC of today compared to the party of the past.
