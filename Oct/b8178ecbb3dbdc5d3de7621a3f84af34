                                         JOHANNESBURG - Akona Ndungane has told EWN Sport that some of the highlights of the famous 2007 Rugby World Cup victory, for him, was the unity between the players and quality of those players. Ndungane was part of the Springbok class of 2007 that went on to beat England 15-6 in the final in Paris. Friday, 20 October, will be exactly 10 years to the day when Jake White’s men lifted the Webb Ellis Trophy. Ndungane says no player felt like he didn’t contribute as much as the next guy. “What stood out and will always stand out is the brotherhood we had among the players. Even though I didn’t have a lot of game time, no one felt like you played fewer minutes than the other.” He says every player got credit for playing a part in the team’s success. “We had one goal and that was to win the World Cup and we achieved that. The success was shared among everyone that was part of that core team and the management.” The now-retired wing adds that coach White got things right with the balance he got in the team between the experience and the youth. “What coach Jake White did right; he had a core group of players that were there from the time he took over in 2004. So, he had enough experience in the team, plus the youth, which gave him a nice balance.”
