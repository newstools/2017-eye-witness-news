                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has confirmed that Jonas Makwakwa will return to work on Wednesday after being cleared of all charges. Makwakwa was suspended in September last year after the Financial Intelligence Centre raised concerns about suspicious payments made into his and his girlfriend's personal accounts. He has been on suspension for more than a year, while management looked into the allegations against him. 'IT’S COMPLICATED' In May, Sars commissioner Tom Moyane said he wanted the investigation by a private law firm into Makwaka concluded as soon as possible. But also told MPs it was complicated. “Mr Makwakwa’s matter is a very complex matter. I, as commissioner, would not like to have albatross hanging (around) my neck of a matter that does not come to end…” Moyane said the Hawks were also carrying out their own investigation. “Given the position that he occupies, it is my wish that the matter is quickly sorted”.
