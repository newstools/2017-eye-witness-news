                                         JOHANNESBURG - uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) veteran Siphiwe Nyanda says talks of unity from President Jacob Zuma  and some African National Congress (ANC) leaders are simply a smokescreen for self-serving factional agendas. Nyanda was delivering a report at the national MK Council Conference at Nasrec. The council’s leadership and the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) have been at loggerheads for some time over the election of Kebby Maphatsoe as chair of the MKMVA. The council says some who voted in June were not members. Nyanda says the veterans have worked with the ANC through multiple meetings, trying to mediate tensions between the two sides. He says, however, that President Jacob Zuma endorsed the MKMVA conference in June by attending the function. “The much talked about importance of unity by many ANC leaders is just a smoke screen for self-serving factional agenda. Many ANC leaders are not interested in genuine, principled unity.” Nyanda and the MKMVA’s Dumisani Nduli say there is evidence to prove that Maphatsoe has ill-intentions towards other veterans. Maphatsoe is yet to respond.
