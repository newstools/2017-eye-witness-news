                                         JOHANNESBURG - Judgement is expected on Monday morning in the case brought by disgruntled ANC officials who are challenging the outcome of the party's chaotic provincial elective conference held at the weekend. Former Eastern Cape provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane was elected chairperson, defeating Phumulo Masualle. The conference was marred by disruptions and violence which saw several delegates being injured and hospitalised. Those opposed to Mabuyane's election have filed papers in the East London High Court, seeking to have the results nullified. ANC Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed delegated on Sunday, describing the violence as shameful and called for unity. “We should not win and feel so victorious that we become arrogant. We should not be feeling so victorious that they say 'go, you who are not here or who have lost'." COURT CASE TO NULLIFY THE CONFERENCE RUMOURS  Registration issues, claims of non-members participating and a chaotic brawl played out at the ANC’s elective conference in East London this weekend. It’s understood not all members were happy that voting continued amid the drama. Rumours of a court case to nullify the conference and its outcome started doing the rounds yesterday afternoon. Former PEC member Andile Lungisa told media houses the urgent application was not going ahead, saying they will address their concerns internally. However, newly elected head, Mabuyane has since given an interview confirming the court action, saying it is driven by Attorney Mvuzo Notyesi and judgement will be handed down later this morning.
