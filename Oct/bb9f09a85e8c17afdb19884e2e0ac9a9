                                         JOHANNESBURG – Organisations linked to two University of Pretoria students who appeared on a video using the K-word recently have quickly reacted to the pair's actions. The two, a third-year physiotherapy student and another, are seen using offensive language and blaming a black person for stealing their phone. The University of Pretoria has since confirmed that the two are students at the institution. In the footage, the two appear to be using the k-word and other profanities saying a black person had stolen one of the women's cellphones.

The education trust says in a Facebook statement that it’s disappointed at the student's actions.  The Vodacom Blue Bulls, which another of the students was a cheerleader for, has also distanced itself from her remarks. The rugby organisation has since axed the student saying it does not condone racial abuse. Pretoria university says the matter is under investigation. An investigation into the matter is underway and the students will be suspended today pending a disciplinary inquiry. 2/3
