                                         CAPE TOWN – Construction at one of Cape Town's desalination plants is scheduled to begin next month in the drought-affected city. Mayor Patricia De Lille visited the site at the V&A Waterfront  earlier on Sunday.

At peak we have about 7-meter tidal waves, which means that there is no issue in terms of marine life, the brine is cleared immediately.”
