                                         JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says President Jacob Zuma did not help to manage the succession race, saying as president he should have told some Presidential candidates that they can't contest the position. Mantashe spoke on the sidelines of the ANC's veterans league conference. He believes President Zuma should have played a role in managing succession. “Cadres of the movement must be told who should not stand but it must be managed; it must not be a free for all. He did not do it, I’m not saying he’s not able, I’m saying he did not.” He says if Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is to be overlooked, there must an explanation. “If an organization like ours has a deputy president and it wants to overlook him, members of the ANC in the first place and to a lesser extent society, must have a sense of why is the sitting deputy president overlooked.” Mantashe revealed that he told Ramaphosa he won't be available as his deputy, suggesting instead to get a woman to deputise him.
