                                         SINGAPORE - Karolina Pliskova put on a ruthless display of big hitting to swat aside crowd favourite Venus Williams 6-2 6-2 as the WTA Finals opened with a pair of power-packed slugfests at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Sunday. After the dust settled on Pliskova’s impressive triumph, Spain’s Garbine Muguruza overcame a spirited Jelena Ostapenko in the second White Group tie of the day, the world number two emerging with a 6-3 6-4 victory over the French Open champion. The 37-year-old Williams is making her first appearance at the elite eight-woman event since 2009 but her Czech opponent hit the ground running and never looked back after she broke the American’s serve early in the first set. The strategy was pretty much established in the opening game, with Williams, the 2008 champion, looking to come to the net whenever possible, while Pliskova was happy to rely on her powerful groundstrokes from the baseline. Pliskova found her range immediately for a routine hold in the first game but Williams struggled when it was her turn to serve as the Czech capitalised on some sloppy play from the American to break with a booming forehand. A flustered Williams settled in the fourth game to finally get on the scoreboard with a second ace of the match and, after the pair exchanged breaks, Pliskova moved 5-2 ahead with a sumptuous volley after working the American around the court. Another double fault gave the world number three her first set point and she duly wrapped up the opener in 32 minutes when Williams went long with an errant backhand. “I think my serve was pretty good today but the scoreline makes it look easier than it was,” Pliskova said in a courtside interview.
