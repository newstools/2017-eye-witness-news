                                         JOHANNESBURG - AfriForum says it’s not aware of any participants singing the old National Anthem at their Black Monday protest against farm murders that took place across the country on Monday. A video of protesters singing Die Stem has gone viral with many saying the song is an offensive representation of the apartheid era. AfriForum says it’s unfortunate that what it calls fake news has overshadowed the call for an end to farm killings. The group's deputy chief executive Ernst Roets said: “If that happened somewhere, it’s not something that AfriForum is aware of. It’s very unfortunate that if we were to accept that it happened, that an isolated case like this is now being used to discredit the entire event. We now have to defend ourselves against something that is fake.” WARNING: this video contains disturbing images of Afrikaners shooting themselves in the foot #diestem #blackmonday pic.twitter.com/LUWoOkW0ih  OLD SA FLAGS Earlier on Tuesday, the African National Congress says it condemns what it calls the arrogant and offensive display of the apartheid flag during Monday’s #BlackMonday campaign. The governing party says that the display of the old apartheid flag is evident of an unrelenting yearning for white supremacy. It says some elements in the campaign racially characterise crime and mock the national reconciliation project. Organisers of the campaign AfriForum on Monday distanced themselves from protesters seen carrying the flags, saying they were not its members.
