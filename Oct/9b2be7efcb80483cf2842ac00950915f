                                            The main opposition party has announced its new leadership in the Western Cape.
                                         CAPE TOWN – Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela has been elected as the DA’s provincial leader.  Madikizela has been acting in this position since January, after Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille’s resigned. He defeated Provincial Legislature Member, Lennit Max, for the position. Bonginkosi Madikizela has kicked dust in Lennit Max’s eyes, who’s been gunning for the position for a fourth time. Social Development MEC Albert Fritz has been announced as his deputy.  Meanwhile, Anton Bredell has maintained his position as provincial Chairperson. The Chairperson of Finance position went to Andricus van der Westhuizen.  Results of the additional member votes will be announced shortly. Nearly 1,000 delegates registered to vote for the party's Western Cape leadership on Saturday. DA leader Mmusi Maimane addressed delegates during his keynote address and called for change in South Africa. He also reminded leaders in the organisation to leave their egos at the door. Maimane urged delegates to to put aside their considerations and loyalties, and think only of the millions of South Africans when voting.
