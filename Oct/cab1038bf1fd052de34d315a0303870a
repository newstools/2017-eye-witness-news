                                         JOHANNESBURG - It's emerged that a security company manager arrested in connection with the OR Tambo International Airport follow-home robberies is also wanted for armed robbery in Limpopo. It's understood the man is one of six suspects who were arrested on Friday night. Authorities say criminals involved in these robberies follow groups of travellers from the airport to their destinations, robbing them of their belongings. Police are investigating whether the suspects are linked to the robbery of seven foreigners on Thursday night in Sandton. The police's Vishnu Naidoo said: “A second suspect who was a passenger in the vehicle was also arrested. Their arrest led to the arrest of four other suspects and the recovery of several items including passports, luggage, two firearms and another vehicle in the Hillbrow area.” On Saturday, the Iraqi ambassador to South Africa said they were waiting to get more details from the police to determine why an Iraqi delegation was the latest group to be targeted by the so-called OR Tambo airport robbers. It’s not yet clear why the delegation is in the country but refused to cut their mission short after the crime. Ambassador Saad Kindeel said one person had been wounded and treated in hospital. “It’s not an unusual thing to happen in South Africa, particularly from the OR Tambo airport and for us this is the first time something like that happens.”
