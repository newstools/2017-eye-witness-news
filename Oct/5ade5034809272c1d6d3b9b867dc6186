                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) says its campuses will remain closed until further notice. Earlier this week, students protested at a Cape Town residence. They're unhappy with disciplinary action taken against four fellow students. CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said: “All CPUT campuses remain closed until further notice.” On Tuesday EWN reported that the four CPUT students were handed a 12-month suspended expulsion verdict. The four were found guilty of disrespecting management and rendering the decision making of administrators ineffective. They were suspended after charges relating to misconduct were brought against them at the end of August. Disciplinary proceedings against the four students stemmed from their efforts to address the lack of sufficient student accommodation on campus. They ended a council meeting when they demanded answers from Vice Chancellor Chris Nhlapo. CPUT Spokesperson Lauren Kansley says the disciplinary process was fair. “An independent external chairperson has found the four students guilty and the sanction was expulsion suspended for 12 months. This means that if the students are found guilty of any disruptions for 12 months from this date, the university will have grounds to pursue another disciplinary hearing and if they are found guilty, they can be expelled.” Additional reporting by Kevin Brandt.
