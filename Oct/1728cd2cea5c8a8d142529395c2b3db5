                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliamentarians have been told Eskom’s suspended CFO Anoj Singh helped Trillian score contracts by giving the company inside information on a “memory stick”. This is according to the whistle-blower, former Trillian employee Mosilo Mothepu. She has told a parliamentary inquiry into Eskom that Singh had an “inappropriate” business relationship with Trillian CEO, Eric Wood. Mothepu told Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises that Trillian was served government deals on a “silver platter” partly thanks to Singh. “Singh was very close to Wood, from the Transnet days.” Trillian was until recently controlled by majority shareholder, Salim Essa, a Gupta family ally. Mothepu explained that Essa’s connections on the boards of state-owned companies were beneficial to Trillian. “Whether it was Denel, SA Express, Transnet or Eskom; Essa had a relationship with either a board member or executive or the chairperson.” According to her calculations, Trillian earned R800 million from its dealings with Eskom and Transnet in its first year of operation. Earlier EWN reported that Parliamentarians have been told that Trillian Capital Partners CEO Eric Wood knew in advance that Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene would be fired, and also had a hand in crafting a speech for Nene’s replacement, Des van Rooyen. Mothepu told the inquiry Wood also knew that Pravin Gordhan would be cut as finance minister. Mothepu worked for Regiments Capital before it was bought by Eric Wood and Salim Essa and became Trillian Capital Partners.
