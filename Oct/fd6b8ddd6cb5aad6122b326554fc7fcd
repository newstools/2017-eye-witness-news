                                         JOHANNESBURG – Zimbabwean opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), says President Robert Mugabe’s Cabinet reshuffle is more about the governing party's internal battles than the benefit of citizens. Mugabe reassigned 10 ministers and made eight completely new deployments to his Cabinet overnight, but the MDC says none of these changes will improve the dire economic situation in the country. Zimbabwean opposition party, the MDC, says Mugabe’s Cabinet reshuffle is more about the governing party’s internal battles than the benefit of citizens. But the MDC says none of these changes to the Cabinet will improve the dire economic situation in the country. Zimbabwe’s shadow ambassador to South Africa Austin Moyo says the reshuffle was aimed at diminishing the role of his deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is said to have been conspiring to take over from the 93-year-old. Mnangagwa has been axed as a defence minister but remains in his position as his deputy. Moyo says this Cabinet reshuffle won’t help Zimbabweans. “It doesn’t change anything in Zimbabwe except that it’s a planned flush out of Mnangagwa for their disagreements on many issues, for the country, economically and otherwise.” He says the reshuffle shows the extent of factions within the Zanu-PF.
