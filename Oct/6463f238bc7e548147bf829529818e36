                                         JOHANNESBURG - Presidential candidate Zweli Mkhize says it’s important that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) now makes its decision whether to reinstate charges against President Jacob Zuma without any pressure, fear or favour. The Supreme Court of Appeal has dismissed an appeal by the NPA and Zuma against a High Court order which set aside the decision to withdraw charges against the President. Mkhize says now it’s simply about waiting for the next step from the NPA. Speaking on the sidelines of his lecture in Kagiso, Mkhize says its important ideas about what the NPA should or shouldn't do are not pre-empted. “I think it’s important for us not to pre-empt a normal court and the normal system of justice, it’s important for us to respect them, whether we like what they say or not.” Mkhize says the future of President Zuma within the party can only be assessed after the national conference in December. “Those are the decisions the ANC can take as to what happens on that level.” He says going forward, it’s time to repair the party such as dealing with the misconduct of leaders.
