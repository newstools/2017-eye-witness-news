                                         PRETORIA - The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) has announced it will hand down judgment in the eight-year-long spy tapes saga on Friday. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and President Jacob Zuma went to Bloemfontein last month to appeal a High Court order which set aside the 2009 decision to withdraw charges against the President. However, the parties conceded in court that the decision was, in fact, unlawful and asked the full bench for directions on the next steps to be taken. After conceding that the withdrawal of charges against Zuma was unlawful, the NPA’s counsel suggested that the matter be referred to advocate Shaun Abrahams to decide afresh if Zuma should be prosecuted. On the other hand, Zuma’s legal team argued that if the matter goes back to Abrahams, they want another opportunity to make representations on why he should not be prosecuted. The High Court had ruled that the effect of setting aside the decision to withdraw charges was an immediate reinstatement of the case. While the Supreme Court can’t instruct the NPA on how it should deal with the matter, it can provide guidelines.
