                                         CAPE TOWN - A Delft man has pleaded guilty to torturing and killing his ex-girlfriend's one-year-old daughter. Pieter van Tonder was arrested in September last year shortly after Asheeqah Scott's murder. The 37-year-old admitted to smoking mandrax on the day he killed her. Van Tonder has admitted to fatally assaulting Scott. She was struck all over her head and body and her death was caused by blunt force head trauma. Doctor Lara Peddle took to the stand on Wednesday and provided details of the more than 20 wounds on the girl's body. Some were burn wounds, including cigarette burns, while others were bruises. She added the child was malnourished and her growth was stunted. Throughout proceedings, the toddler's mother sobbed while her grandmother held her head in her hands.
