                                         CAPE TOWN – The man appointed to handle complaints against the Hawks, says he will not delay any investigations that come his way. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula announced Judge Frans Kgomo's appointment on Friday, saying he replaces Judge Essa Moosa who passed away earlier this year. Kgomo says he will be "scrupulously fair" with all his investigations. “The four corners of the complaint and what is there in the Act and the Constitution will guide me.” The Hawks and National Prosecuting Authority have come under fire recently for not moving on an investigation into allegations of corruption at the state-owned Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa.
