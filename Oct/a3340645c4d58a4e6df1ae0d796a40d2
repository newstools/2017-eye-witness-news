                                         DURBAN - The father of slain Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa says bribery and cover-ups are the reasons that his son’s killers remain outside prison. Sam Meyiwa was speaking outside his home in Umlazi on Saturday where the family held a prayer service to remember the soccer star. The pirates captain was killed three years ago in what appears to have been a botched robbery in Vosloorus. Meyiwa’s killers have still not been arrested.  His father says authorities repeat the same story whenever they share an update about his son’s case. “There’s nothing different about their story every time they come here.” Meyiwa says even though the unanswered questions have taken a toll on the family, they aren’t willing to give up yet. “I have hope that God will help me, the truth will come out.” The slain soccer star’s father says he believes the police and those who were in the room on that fatal day are being bribed into silence.
