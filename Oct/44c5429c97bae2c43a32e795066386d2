                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) has accused South African Revenue Services (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane of protecting institutions that collude with criminal syndicates. The communist party wants Moyane to be sacked, saying he has tainted the image of the revenue service. The party says that Moyane is responsible for the expected R50 billion tax revenue shortfall and for the collusion the party claims happened between those in the institution and the tobacco industry. SACP leader Solly Mapaila says: “In the presence where the leadership of the receiver of revenue protects intuitions that collude with criminal syndicates, it’s impossible therefore to think that they can do the right job in that institution.” The communist party claims that Moyane has allowed rogue elements to flourish at the institution, with allegations of collusion with syndicates, including those in the tobacco industry. The SACP’s Solly Mapaila says there's a lot of rot at the revenue service. “Sars has allowed rogue elements inside the system to actually collude with criminal syndicates, including those in the tobacco industry.”
