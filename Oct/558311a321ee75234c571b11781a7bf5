                                         CAPE TOWN - The Congress of the People (Cope) is looking for public to support a petition to Parliament to put a stop to government's nuclear plans.  Cope leader Mosioua Lekota says President Jacob Zuma is acting recklessly by looking to enter into nuclear deals with Russia. Speaking at Parliament on Tuesday, Lekota said last week's Cabinet reshuffle has paved the way for government to proceed with its nuclear ambitions despite a Western Cape High Court ruling in May that found five cooperation agreements signed by government to have been illegal. He says Parliament should have interrogated the judgment and stopped Zuma from pressing ahead with his nuclear ambitions. “The president has already shown the propensity to undermine the law, to ignore the Constitution and even the courts to go ahead with his business. We think once we have those numbers, the Speaker will have no choice but to call president Zuma to account.” Last week, the Department of Environmental Affairs gave its approval for a site at Duynefontein adjacent to the Koeberg nuclear station in the Western Cape to become the first site for reactors as part of government's nuclear build programme.
