Mortimer Saunders was in the Goodwood Magistrates Court on Friday morning. The little girl's body was found in a shallow grave in Epping in May, days after she was reported missing. Loud cheers came from a packed public gallery as the court heard the investigation is complete and Saunders will stand trial in the High Court next year. #CourtneyPieters Community members outside court say they are overjoyed.
