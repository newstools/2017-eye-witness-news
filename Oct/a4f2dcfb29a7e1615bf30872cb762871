                                         JOHANNESBURG – There have been mixed feelings from Wits University students over the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)’s overwhelming victory in the student representative council elections. The EFF student wing has won the hotly contested SRC elections, taking 12 out of 15 seats. The red berets take over the reins from the African National Congress (ANC) aligned Progressive Youth Alliance (PYA). This is the first time the EFF student command has won in the highly contested student elections at Wits University. One student says he’s pleased about the change in student leadership because the previous SRC had become too complacent. “PYA has been too comfortable over the past years and they have gotten lazy and the EFF has always been at the forefront in the fight for free education.” While this student shares a different view. “I feel like I’d have preferred if it was PYA because I just don’t trust the men in red berets.” The victory comes as students continue to grapple with issues including free higher education, outsourcing and what they term decolonisation of institutions.
