                                         JOHANNESBURG - The former chairperson of the Gauteng mental health review board has told the arbitration hearing into the Esidimeni tragedy that the Health Department only told them about the marathon project two months before it was scheduled to begin. Dumazile Masondo is testifying in Parktown on Friday morning. One hundred and forty-one mentally ill people died after the Health Department terminated its contract with the Life Esidimeni group, claiming that this was to save costs. The patients were moved to unlawful NGOs and died within a short period. Masondo says she was appointed chairperson of the Gauteng Mental Health Review board in January 2016, just two months before the transfer of psychiatric patients from Esidimeni facilities began. Masondo says the board was told about the Esidimeni project 10 days after her appointment. She says they were told by former HOD, Dr Barney Selebano, that their help would not be needed. “Because our independence, Mr Justice, was very much being infringed as a board.” Four months ago, during her budget vote speech on the Gauteng Provincial Legislature Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa announced the suspension of all the board members pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. The suspensions were in line with the Health Ombudsman’s recommendations.
