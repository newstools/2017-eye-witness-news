Two men, among them a notorious gang boss, were shot and wounded at the airport on Wednesday morning.No arrests have been made at this stage.  Mbalula's spokesperson Vuyo Mhaga says: “The minister will be meeting with airport management and police in future, to check whether we can implement similar measures like those at OR Tambo International Airport.” Police launched a crime-fighting plan earlier this year in the wake of an increase in airport attacks. The police last month claimed that there had been a decrease in attacks on people travelling from OR Tambo International Airport since the launch of its plan. A number of suspects were arrested at the airport following the launch in July in connection with crimes, such as drug and rhino horn smuggling and vehicle theft. Several airport officials have also undergone a vetting process as part of the crimefighting plan. WATCH: Cape Town International Airport shooting caught on camera  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
