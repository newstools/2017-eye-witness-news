                                         CAPE TOWN - The SA Agulhas II will make its first voyage into the warm waters as part of the second international Indian Ocean research expedition. South Africa will be one of several countries that will be participating in the expedition. The vessel will be deployed to help conduct wide-ranging marine research in the ocean. The ship sails from Table Bay on Saturday and arrives in Durban on Monday, where the South African leg of the expedition will officially start two days later. Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa says the expedition will bring about several benefits. “The gathering of basic long-term data and information will place developing countries of the Indian Ocean in a better position to conserve the integrity of their ocean and to find ways in unlocking their respective potential ocean’s economy to improve the livelihoods of their citizens.”
