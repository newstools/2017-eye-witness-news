                                         JOHANNESBURG - Workers at the Thelle Mogoerane  Hospital in Vosloorus have embarked on a strike over safety concerns after a security company stopped its services at the facility. It’s understood that some patients have since been prematurely discharged and some families have had to personally watch over their loved ones. Hospital CEO Nomonde Mbambo says that they’re negotiating with the workers and unions to try and resolve the situation. “Part of the reasons why is the fact that our staff members felt unsecure and they also were concerned about patient safety because the security personnel have also downed tools.”
