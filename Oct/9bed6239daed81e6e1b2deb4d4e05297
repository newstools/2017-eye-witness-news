                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)  has apologised unreservedly for the insults hurled at MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun during its march in the city centre last week. During the Johannesburg leg of demonstration, Sun was asked by Mayor Herman Mashaba to receive a memorandum and meet representatives from the trade union federation. Sun says one Cosatu leader introduced him as Mr Lee and referred to him as ‘fong kong’. Cosatu says it acknowledges that the leaders involved in insulting Sun went too far. National spokesperson Sizwe Pamla says, “Officials, shop stewards and workers, there’s always that temptation to get easy applause. They were hurtful, there was a level of intolerance and they were patronising.”
