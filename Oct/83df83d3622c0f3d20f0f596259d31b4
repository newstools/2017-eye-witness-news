                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police have confirmed that two Uber vehicles have been set alight during Friday morning's protests on the R21 and R24 highways.  At least 30 meter taxi drivers have now been arrested after disrupting traffic during their demonstration near OR Tambo International Airport.  They say that the cab hailing service is operating illegally and that their concerns continue to be ignored.  The policeâ€™s Lungelo Dlamini says that protesting meter taxi drivers who abandoned their cars and who laid on the highway are part of the group arrested this morning. Dlamini says they hope this sends a strong message to meter taxi drivers not to obstruct traffic. An investigation is now underway to determine how the two Uber vehicles were torched during the protest.
