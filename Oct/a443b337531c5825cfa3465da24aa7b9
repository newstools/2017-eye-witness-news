One of those killed was an eight-year-old child who was struck by lightning, the other person was a 46-year-old man who drowned while trying to cross an overflowing river. The department’s Lennox Mabaso said: “An eigh-year-old in the area of Mbewunye in the Nqutu Local Municipality was struck by lightning, while a 46-year-old male drowned while trying to cross an overflowing river. We have also effected road closures on the N2 and other parts of the arterial road in the province.” WATCH: KZN hit by heavy rain and flooding  Meanwhile, at least five hospitals have been adversely affected by the heavy rains. King Edward, Addington, King Dinuzulu and Wentworth and Prince Mshiyeni Memorial hospitals have borne the most brunt of the storm. KZN Health Department Spokesperson Sam Mkhwanazi said: “Five of our health facilities in Durban have been adversely affected by the storm. These are Prince Mshiyeni in the South of Durban, King Edward, Wentworth, Kind Dinuzulu and Addington.” Emergency teams remain on standby throughout all affected areas. The weather services say the storm is set to move to northern parts of KZN later on Tuesday afternoon. Senior forecaster Puseletso Mofokeng said: “By the latter part of this afternoon we are going to have the rainfall easing off from the southern areas, although, the impact has been quite huge. Going into the evening, the main action will be in the northern coast and the adjacent interior.” See below animation of wind speeds in KZN  Dramatic pictures are being shared on social media showing cars being swept away, people wading through knee length water and damaged to buildings, including hospitals. Emergency teams have been responding to incidents of people being trapped in cars in the deluge.

Spokesperson Colins Naidoo said: “But we are encouraging people to be safe on the roads but try to get to the airport earlier and also to check online the status of their flight with their respective airline.
