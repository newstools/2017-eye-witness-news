                                         CAPE TOWN – Democratic Alliance (DA) Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela says crime in the City’s Metro has taken on warzone-like proportions. Madikizela addressed a crowd of supporters outside the Philippi-East Police Station on Saturday, calling for the rollout of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to be expedited. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has requested the Defence and Military Veterans Department to assist with the rollout of the army to several crime-riddled communities in Gauteng and the Western Cape. DA Western Cape Youth members handed over a memorandum of demands to officials at the Philippi East police station. They have called for decisive action to be taken to limit crime in several Cape Town communities. Madikizela says the efforts to fight crime need to be reinforced. “The army must come in our communities because it’s a warzone.” DA Cape Metro Youth leader Carl Pophaim says crime is holding various communities hostage. “We know what happened a few weeks ago in Marikana informal settlement, 11 people were murdered in one evening. We recognise that it was four months to the day that one of our local councillors was murdered. So the people are tired.” No details have been made available as to when and if soldiers will be deployed to assist with crime fighting. President Jacob Zuma has the final say.
