                                         JOHANNESBURG - The incoming Wits Students Representative Council (SRC) says despite other universities already starting fees must fall protests, it will first meet with students before deciding on whether to join them. There have already been protests at University of Cape Town and Cape Peninsula University of Technology, following speculation of a 10% increase. A Wits press conference has been delayed, with the outgoing SRC telling the new leadership that they have not consulted students. President-elect Orediretse Masebe says it’s important to give guidance to students. “Let it not be a misconception that the division that you have seen today is a division that students have against us, what we are here simply for is that we want to give direction on the position of a shutdown.” He says there will be no Fees Must Fall protest at Wits until a mass meeting is held. “Students have voted for us in the hope that we are going to take a coordinated and structured approach to student issues.” He says they have no faith in the Fees Commission report because it is led by a failed government.
