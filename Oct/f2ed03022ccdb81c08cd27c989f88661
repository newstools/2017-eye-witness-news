                                         JOHANNESBURG - An Uber client has told Eyewitness News how she was attacked by metered-taxi drivers in a frightening confrontation while travelling to OR Tambo International Airport. Two Uber vehicles were torched on Friday morning, while their passengers were assaulted during the protest on the R21 and R24 highways. Metered-taxi drivers barricaded the highway demanding that government ban the cab-hailing service which they say is operating illegally. The Uber client, whose asked not to be named, has described how she was forced out of the car and told to run before the vehicle was petrol bombed. “He told me I need to run and then they threw a petrol bomb into the car. It was very traumatic.” She says further down the road, another Uber car was attacked and the occupants of that car were also assaulted. “They actually beat them with bricks, the girl was really badly beaten and dragged across the road.” The woman says a truck driver came to the couple's rescue. Kempton Park police are investigating the attacks. Uber has called the incident unacceptable and says further investigations are underway.
