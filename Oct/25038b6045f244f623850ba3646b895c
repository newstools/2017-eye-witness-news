                                         JOHANNESBURG - Corruption Watch says software giant SAP’s decision to report its dealing with the Guptas to US authorities shows the company may not take the Hawks seriously. SAP has admitted payments of up to R100 million were paid to a Gupta-linked company that assisted with contracts with Eskom and Transnet. It says it has disclosed these contracts to the US authorities for further investigation and that it has taken action against three employees. SAP says it’s not working with South African authorities at this stage but has reported itself to the US authorities for allegations of wrongdoing. While there’s been no evidence of payments made to South African government officials or Eskom and Transnet employees, four contracts it had in place with these state-owned entities resulted in commission payments of up to R100 million to a company it understands to be Gupta-related. Corruption Watch’s David Lewis says this was revealed in leaked emails reported to local authorities three months ago. “The Hawks didn’t do anything except query the authenticity of the emails and they haven’t been reported to by SAP, which I think it’s a view of how these companies take the Hawks.” SAP says the investigation has not yet been completed but it’s eliminated sales commission on all public sector deals in high risk countries including South Africa.
