                                         CAPE TOWN - Police have arrested yet another drug smuggler at Cape Town International Airport. The woman was apprehended at the weekend. Western Cape police say officers, acting on a tip-off, singled out two people who'd disembarked a flight from Angola.  Officers came up empty-handed after searching one of the passengers. But a Brazilian woman was found in possession of 91 bullets of cocaine. It's one of several busts at the airport in recent days. Last week, a woman was arrested after she was caught trying to smuggle cocaine worth R2 million. Almost two weeks ago, another woman was apprehended after arriving on a flight from Angola. She had swallowed 100 pellets containing cocaine. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
