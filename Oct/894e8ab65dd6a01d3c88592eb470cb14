                                         CAPE TOWN - The chairperson of Parliament’s Justice Committee Mathole Motshekga says the African National Congress (ANC) is not at odds with each other over a decision to hold an inquiry into the Public Protector’s fitness to hold office.  He says the committee has only taken a decision on the appropriate forum to handle the matter, but not considered the merits of the Democratic Alliance (DA)'s complaints. The DA is now calling for Busisiwe Mkhwebane to be suspended pending an inquiry. Luthuli House says an inquiry into Mkhwebane is a witch-hunt, while ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says it’s frivolous, but Motshekga says they are entitled to their opinion. “We couldn’t come to a determination whether or not it is frivolous, we could only deal with the matter of which forum.” The DA’s Glennis Breytenbach wants the president to suspend Mkhwebane, a move provided for by the Constitution once proceedings for removal have begun.
