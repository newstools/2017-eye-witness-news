                                         JOHANNESBURG - Six prisoners have escaped from the Kutama Senthumule maximum prison in Limpopo after warders went on strike. It’s understood the prisoners went on a rampage, damaging property by setting buildings alight. Police have launched a manhunt for the escaped prisoners and warned residents not to try to apprehend the wanted men. The police's Motlafela Mojapelo said: “We are making an appeal to community members not to attempt and arrest them because they are deemed to be dangerous. We have since opened cases of malicious damage to property, arson, intimidation because we understand some of the workers that were on duty were intimidated by the striking ones.”
