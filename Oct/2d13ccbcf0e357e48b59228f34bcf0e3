                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Initiative for Strategic Litigation in Africa is calling on Tanzanian authorities to return the passports of two South Africans arrested there and to allow them to leave the country. The pair is among a group of 13 lawyers and activists who were detained last week for allegedly promoting homosexuality. They are currently out on bail but haven’t been formally charged. The organisation is adamant that the activists did not commit any crime. ISLA lawyer Matilda Lesseko said: “They must just give them back their passports because there is no offence that has been committed. So passports must be given back to them and they must be allowed to leave the country.” The group was in the country preparing for a court battle, aimed at forcing the government to give better health services to their citizens.
