                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Institute for Security Studies (ISS) says that it is up to President Jacob Zuma to appoint the right people to manage the police in order for crime to decrease. The institute’s head of justice and violence prevention program, Gareth Newham says that the fundamental problem with policing is political interference at the highest level. The 2016/2017 national crime statistics released on Tuesday shows that murder has gone up by 1.8%, while aggravated robbery increased by 6.4%. Newham says that Zuma has to make it his personal responsibility to tackle crime. “Jacob Zuma is the only person who has the power to the Constitution to appointment the national commissioner of police and he has chosen to appoint people who turned out not to have experience or the integrity to manage the police effectively and that has caused this deterioration.” [NEWS IN NUMBERS] Murder remains a problem as it is up 1.8% @MbalulaFikile #crimestats https://t.co/r88CoGvmGt pic.twitter.com/Ex7kweoYPc  [NEWS IN NUMBERS] @MbalulaFikile has revealed that contact crimes dropped 3.3% in the last year. #crimestats pic.twitter.com/mq1MqkQff8
