The 88-year-old has been leading the party since its inception in 1975. He made the announcement at the IFP’s extended national council meeting in Durban on Sunday. Velenkosi Hlabisa is tipped is tipped to take over from Buthelezi. The IFP's chief whip in Parliament, Narend Singh says it's been coming for some time. “He has been telling us as the leadership of the party that for some time now that he would really like to retire and he doesn’t want people to continually vilify him as a leader who wants to be there for life.” Singh says KZN Provincial Secretary Velenkosi Hlabisa is tipped to take over from Buthelezi. “He will continue to be the president until the conference. Our constitution does provide for anybody who wants to put names in the hat to come forward at the stage; but Mr Hlabisa has received the overwhelming support of the national council, which is 500 leaders of the party.”
