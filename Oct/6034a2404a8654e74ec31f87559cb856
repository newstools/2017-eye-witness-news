                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) has requested an urgent meeting with Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to address the murders in Marikana and the rest of the platinum belt. The union has also announced that it will ask forensic investigator Paul O’Sullivan to probe the incidents. Several miners have been killed in the area, with the latest murder this week. Amcu says that the killings on the platinum belt need to be investigated dating back to 2012. Just days before the Marikana massacre that year, several miners were killed and Amcu says that there needs to be justice. In a statement, the union says it plans to ask O’Sullivan to solve the case. O’Sullivan says if appointed to do the job, he will get to the bottom of the killings very quickly. “I think political killings are a big problem in South Africa, for example, people that are getting murdered because they mean to speak about corruption or other areas.” The exact motive for the killings is still unclear, despite the arrest of three suspects earlier this week.
