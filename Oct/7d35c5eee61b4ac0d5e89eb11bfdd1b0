                                         CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula has reassured Philippi residents that this past weekend’s mass shooting  will never be repeated. Jula is part of Police Minister Fikile Mbalula’s delegation visiting the community following this past weekend’s shootings that left 11 people dead. Police on Monday arrested four suspects, but it’s still being determined whether they can be linked to the bloody killings. Jula says officials are hard at work investigating the killings. “The members of your families have not died in vain, but there are lessons that we have to learn from what has happened that must help us to ensure that such sad and tragic incidents do not happen ever again in this area”
