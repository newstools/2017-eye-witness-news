Phumzile Dube died in February 2014 when Duduzane Zuma’s Porsche collided with the taxi in which she was travelling. PRETORIA - Lobby group AfriForum has announced that the first person it intends to privately prosecute is Duduzane Zuma on charges of culpable homicide. Head of the private prosecuting unit, Advocate Gerrie Nel, made the announcement in Centurion on Tuesday morning. Phumzile Dube died in February 2014 when Zuma’s Porsche collided with the taxi in which she was travelling. Although an inquest found Zuma’s negligent conduct led to the crash, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) decided in August 2015 not to prosecute. Nel says they have filed a request for a certificate confirming the NPA’s intention not to pursue the case. “We have assisted the Dube family to submit an application this morning to prosecute Mr Duduzane Zuma on a charge of culpable homicide.” The advocate says an inquest found that Zuma was responsible for Dube’s death. “The inquest caught by the finding that the death of Phumzile Dube was prima facie brought up by the negligent act of Mr Zuma. “The magistrate found that Mr Zuma failed to conduct himself in a reasonable manner under the circumstances and under the adverse weather conditions, and she rejected his defence of aquaplaning.” LISTEN: AfriForum announces first private prosecution case
