                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former KPMG South Africa CEO Moses Kgosana has now resigned as non-executive director from a fifth and final JSE listed company, Famous Brands. Under his watch, the auditing firm allegedly syphoned taxpayer's money away from a dairy project in the Free State to instead fund the Gupta family wedding. Kgosana has also been implicated in the #Guptaleaks emails, having attended the multi-million rand wedding at Sun City in 2013. Kgosana says during a meeting with Famous Brands on Friday, he agreed to step down due to what he calls media discomfort.  Kgosana says he is now focusing on doing his own thing and he no longer has any contact with the Guptas. “There are private company boards of people who regard me that I add value. The Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital - I serve there as chairperson of the audit committee. They’ve got no problem with that. They’re not paying me for that, that’s private.”  Kgosana says the only damage his reputation has suffered is the result of a media report by amaBhungane, that he attended the lavish Gupta wedding in 2013. The investigative unit suggested that this amounted to an unfair work relationship a claim he says is unfounded.
