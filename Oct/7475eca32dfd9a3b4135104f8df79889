                                         JOHANNESBURG - Global NGO A21 says South Africans need to change the perception that human trafficking is an infrequent crime that only occurs in other countries. Dozens of people participated in a national walk for freedom in various locations across the country on Saturday, hoping to create awareness around the dangers of human trafficking. A21 says the Global Slavery Index currently lists nearly 250,000 South Africans as enslaved. A21's Mandy Murugan says human trafficking is a serious crime and appropriate charges should be introduced in South Africa. “We can’t continue prosecuting offenders of human trafficking under laws like kidnapping or rape. human trafficking is a crime on its own and we should start prosecuting offenders against that law.”
