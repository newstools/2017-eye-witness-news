                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Zweli Mkhize says Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will have to put his name forward just like every other candidate running for the top spot of the party. Mkhize was responding to questions regarding the so-called tradition of the ANC where the deputy automatically succeeds the president. He was speaking on the sidelines at the Chief Mogale Hall where he had his OR Tambo Memorial Lecture on Friday. Mkhize says the ANC Constitution says anyone can be nominated and nominate for the Presidency. “The deputy president will be among those that are right to be considered.” He says at the end of the day it’s at the national conference where that decision is made. “There is a right for all members to nominate any member. If it was as straightforward as that, there would not be a need for a conference.” Mkhize says the ANC intends to reform and refuses to entertain any questions that the party might lose in the 2019 national elections.
