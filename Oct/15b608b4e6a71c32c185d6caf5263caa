                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has hailed Mangosuthu Buthelezi for serving the party in a remarkable way as he prepares to step down as its leader. Buthelezi, who has been leading the IFP since its inception in 1975, will hand over the reins at his party's elective conference next year. He made the announcement at the IFP’s extended national council meeting in Durban on Sunday. Buthelezi has had a long and successful political career. He has played a key role in South Africa’s history and represented his party during the Codesa negotiations in the early 90s, which later saw the country's first democratic election.  He then followed to serve as the first Home Affairs Minister for 10 years under the new democratic republic from 1994. Buthelezi has been a member of Parliament since then, while leading his party. It is understood that the long-serving IFP leader, affectionately known as Shenge, is expected to be succeeded by national executive committee member Velenkosini Hlabisa. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
