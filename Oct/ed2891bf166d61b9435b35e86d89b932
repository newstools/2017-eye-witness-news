                                         JOHANNESBURG - With President Jacob Zuma  expected to give a formal response to the fees commission report before the end of this week, students are now mapping out a plan of action to the official document. According to the City Press, the Heher Commission found that free education is not feasible for all and other models need to be adopted to address the funding crisis at South Africa's institutions of higher learning. Last week saw students march on Parliament for free education, calling on Zuma to release the document. Some student leaders say while they've seen the leaked fees report, they will wait for the official response from President Zuma before taking any action. University of Cape Town's SRC's Sinawo Thambo said: “If the final report has those contents, I think people can expect a lot of unrest with regards to that.” Wits University's Oridiretse Masebe says they're in a process of meeting with students to decide on a way forward. “I’m saying that the process starts when we engage students through a mass meeting.” The Presidency says Zuma is still consulting other government structures before releasing the contents of the report.
