                                         JOHANNESBURG – Freedom Under Law says it notes with concern the report by the expert panel appointed by the Constitutional Court to monitor the transition to a new social grants payment system.  The panel says the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has repeatedly failed to provide them with the information it requires in order to perform its mandate.  Freedom Under Law says it’s concerning that Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini announced that she has authorised the Post Office to make social grant payments, while the expert panel’s report reveals otherwise. It says Dlamini is again deviating from normal tender processes, because there is not enough time to appoint suitable service providers before the current contract expires on 31 March next year. Freedom Under Law’s Nicole Fritz says, “We feel like the minister and those involved are not performing their duties as required by the Constitutional Court and in fact are frustrating the transition to a proper grant payment system.”
