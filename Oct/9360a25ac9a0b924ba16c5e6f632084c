                                         ZIMBABWE - A prominent lawyer and aspiring MP in Zimbabwe is due in court on Monday on security-related charges. Fadzayi Mahere was detained for several hours on Saturday for organising a community soccer tournament. It was meant to be a fun soccer day for children, instead riot police arrived and ordered everyone to leave. Mahere, who plans to stand independent, was arrested charged under the country’s strict Public Security and Order Act, according to her official Facebook page. In a tweet on Sunday, Mehere described the police action as crazy. Thank you so much.Zvinotoda minamato. These goons are crazy. Unleashing armed riot police on a crowd with kids playing on bouncy castles. https://t.co/ePHxyokw7G  Her arrest sparked an outcry on social media. So ZanuPF is running scared of @advocatemahere. Arresting her for organizing football tournament. What a shame. You have my support Fadzai pic.twitter.com/KwBMgaJeyM  If you aren't angry and outraged, you are not paying attention #NotYetUhuru #FreeFadzi pic.twitter.com/N4HSETnzKc  Protect Fadzayi Mahere at all costs #FreeFadzi.  Critics say it shows how difficult it will be for independent candidates to campaign ahead of next year’s vote. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
