                                         JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the African National Congress (ANC) must not use its desire for unity as an excuse to ignore the corruption and misconduct in its ranks.  Ramaphosa delivered a lecture in the Free State on Friday in memory of Kaizer Sebothelo, an ANC NEC member and provincial secretary who died in a car accident in 1996.  He says the party's unity must not come at the expense of its founding values and that the movement must emerge from its December elective conference as one, knowing where it's going.  The deputy president says the ANC must be cleansed at the conference and elect visionary leaders who can inspire South Africans. “We want them to come up with real policies that are going to take South Africa forward.” Ramaphosa says delegates should keep in mind the spirit of past ANC leaders like Walter Sisulu, Nelson Mandela and Albert Luthuli. “They must remember that they bear on their shoulders the hopes and the aspirations of all our people. And we want those people to recommit themselves to achieving the complete liberation of our people.”
