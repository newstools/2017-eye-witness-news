Seven convicts escaped from the correctional facility earlier this week, and police have been chasing them ever since. Police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says the search continues for the other three. “The team is still continuing with the search and we hope that they will all be nabbed.”  Police announced the rearrest of two other suspects earlier on Saturday.
