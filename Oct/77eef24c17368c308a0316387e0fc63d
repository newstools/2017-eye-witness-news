                                         PRETORIA - All eyes are on Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday after President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared winner of the re-run election Odinga abandoned a fortnight ago. Will he go to the courts again to challenge the poll that he’s dismissed as a sham? Despite calls from Kenyatta for Kenyans to reach out after a divisive and protracted electoral period, the country remains on a knife edge. At least 14 people have died since the re-run poll last Thursday. And the death toll since the August election overturned by the Supreme Court is at least 70. Most worrying is that violence between political opponents is taking on an increasingly ethnic character, reminiscent of the 2008 conflict that left 1,500 people dead.
