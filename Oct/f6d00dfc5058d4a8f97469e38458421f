                                         DURBAN - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has sent its condolences to the family of a councillor who was murdered by three unknown assassins on Monday night. Nkosinathi Ngcobo was gunned down in his vehicle; bringing to five the number of people who have been murdered  in the Harry Gwala region this year. That region is believed to be backing presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in the succession race. Ngcobo's murder also follows the death of former ANC Youth League secretary general Sindiso Magaqa who was shot several times in July. KZN ANC provincial secretary Super Zuma says the working committee is working to unite the Harry Gwala region. “The PEC conveys its sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of comrade Nkosinathi Ngcobo who was murdered last night. He was a former ANC branch chairperson.”
