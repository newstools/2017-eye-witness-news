Sassa and the Post Office met in Parliament on Tuesday to try and break a deadlock related to the payment of social grants. JOHANNESBURG - Former South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) director general Zane Dangor says if negotiations between Sassa and the South African Post Office are done in good faith, the Post Bank will be able to pay social grants. Sassa and the Post Office met in Parliament on Tuesday to try and break a deadlock related to the payment of social grants. With only five months to go before Sassa is expected to take over the payment of social grants, Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has agreed to return to parliament on Wednesday night to report back on negotiations. Dangor says the tender system that the agency plans on approaching is concerning. “Two things that can happen in this case; is that either there go on a tender and people can’t respond within the timeframe or there are already made solutions.”
