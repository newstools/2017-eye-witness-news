                                         JOHANNESBURG - While the African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State acknowledges its leadership’s mandate has expired, it says those taking it to court are being disrespectful to the party’s processes. In a legal letter, a member of the party in the province has asked the national executive committee to disband the provincial leadership by next Monday and appoint a provincial task team or face court action. The provincial conference which was due to take place in August still hasn’t convened. Free State ANC spokesperson Thabo Mmeko says those who want to go to court should have turned to the party’s structures first. “People are taking us to court and they wrote a letter to the SG, saying our mandate has expired - granted. But there’s an organisational process, we were supposed to sit in May [and do an] audit processes because equally, you must be able to respect those administrative processes.” ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe recently informed provincial and league secretaries in a memo that in order for the December elective conference to go ahead as planned, there should be no regional or provincial congresses after September.
