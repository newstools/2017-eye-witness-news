                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan says the suggestion that the outcome of the African National Congress’ (ANC)  December elective conference has been predetermined is a lie. Gordhan was speaking at the annual Ahmed Kahthrada Foundation’s Lecture at Wits University on Saturday, where he said there is a serious contest within the party on who is going to succeed President Jacob Zuma. He says the race is not only about who is going to take over but how their regime will impact the current status quo within the party. “That contest in many ways is about three things: retaining the status quo, replacing the status quo with the same thing and advancing personal interests. And maybe the fourth thing which I should mention is changing the status quo completely.” Gordhan adds the outcome of the conference has an influence on many other issues. “To that extent, the ANC remains very relevant both now and the future of this country and what happens in December does matter as the ANC still has another 20 months.”
