                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament’s Public Enterprises portfolio committee has officially kicked off its inquiry into allegations of state capture at Eskom. It follows revelations in leaked emails of influence peddling by the Gupta family to score lucrative state contracts. The committee’s acting chairperson Zukiswa Rantho began by spelling out the inquiry’s mandate and scope. She’s explained that the committee will focus on Eskom before turning the spotlight on Transnet and Denel. “Members of the committee, like many in our country, have observed disturbing developments at state-owned enterprises, like Eskom, Transnet and Denel. This has been documented in a number of reports, including the Public Protector’s state capture report.” University of Cape Town professor, Anton Eberhard, was first to give evidence. He’s authored a "reference book" of alleged instances of governance failure and corruption at Eskom. Eberhard says that as the largest state-owned enterprise, Eskom has seen blatant acts of corruption. “Madonsela’s report provided the first comprehensive legal analysis of the alleged systemic corruption being perpetrated through state-owned enterprises. Expository work on stare capture has since advanced, thanks to the extraordinarily brave reporting by investigate journalists, some of them here in this room.” WATCH: Parly's Public Enterprises portfolio committee starts state capture probe   (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
