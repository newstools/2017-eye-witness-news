                                         CAPE TOWN - The United Democratic Movement (UDM) says basic rules and regulations were flouted during a council meeting in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality in August. It’s during this meeting that Mongameli Bobani was removed as deputy mayor through a vote of no confidence. The Democratic Alliance (DA) says that Bobani has undermined their coalition agreement by voting with the African National Congress on numerous occasions. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says he met with DA leader Mmusi Maimane with regard to the matter in September. “He admitted that they’ve made mistakes in the coalition. I asked him whether this fracas called democracy by the DA speaker is one of them.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
