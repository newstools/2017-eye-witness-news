                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Inkatha Freedom Party’s (IFP) Velenkosini Hlabisa has hailed outgoing leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi as someone who played a central role in shaping the country. Buthelezi announced in Durban on Sunday that he will step down as leader at the party's next elective conference next year. He's been at the helm since the IFP’s inception in 1975. Hlabisa has been nominated to take over the reins from Buthelezi. “The IFP has stood for the good values and even the electorate is looking at the IFP as an alternative.”
