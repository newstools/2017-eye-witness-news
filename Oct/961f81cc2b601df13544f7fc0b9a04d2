                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has argued that the High Court should dismiss President Jacob Zuma's state of capture review application because he is abusing the court processes for “ulterior purposes”.  Zuma approached the High Court this week to set aside the remedial action which compelled him to appoint the commission of inquiry, led by a judge selected by the Chief Justice.  But the president's counsel told the court they were abandoning the request and asked that the State of Capture report be referred back to the Public Protector in the event he succeeds in his review application. The legal teams were asked to file additional heads of argument on this narrow point. The DA referred to a Constitutional Court ruling, which held where a court finds that the machinery devised for the better administration of justice is being used for an ulterior purpose, the court is duty bound to prevent such abuse. The party says it's clear Zuma’s purpose with this application is to ensure the issues raised in the Public Protector’s report, which implicate him and his friends, are never investigated, unless it’s investigated on his terms.  The party believes Zuma wants to pick the person conducting the investigation and decide the terms of reference, despite the patent conflict of interest and lack of perceived independence that would be involved.  The DA has asked the court to compel Zuma to immediately set up the commissioner of inquiry.  It has also asked that Zuma personally pick up the costs of the application because it was brought for an improper and unconstitutional purpose.
