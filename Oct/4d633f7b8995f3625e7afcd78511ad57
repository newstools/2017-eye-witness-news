                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Metro Police officers have recovered eight illegal firearms in the past 14 days.  In the latest arrest during the early hours of Saturday morning officials nabbed four suspects in Philippi East after they were found in possession of an illegal firearm and seven rounds of ammunition.  Police and other law enforcement officials have beefed up patrols in Philippi following the murder of 11 people in separate shootings about two weeks ago.  The city’s JP Smith said: “They recovered a pistol with a serial number filed off, a magazine and seven rounds of ammunition. Four suspects aged between 17 and 41 were detained at Philippi East. “The illegal firearm confiscation means Metro Police have now found eight illegal firearms in 14 days. This is indicative of a very serious problem with a number of illegal firearms in circulation. We need a high-level investigation into where these firearms are coming from and who is selling them.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
