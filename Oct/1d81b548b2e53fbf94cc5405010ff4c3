                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Hawks have confirmed a docket has now been opened to investigate former apartheid security branch policeman Jan Rodrigues in connection with the murder of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol. Earlier this month, Judge Billy Mothle ruled that Timol had been pushed to his death from the 10th floor of the John Vorster Square Police Station in 1971 The initial inquest in 1972 ruled that the activist jumped to his death but evidence suggested otherwise. The testimony of those who testified at the latest inquest at the High Court in Pretoria this year will be used as part of the criminal investigation. The Hawks’ Hangwani Mulaudzi says: “Together with the NPA’s Crime Litigation Unit, we’re going to be looking into the matter. It was of course a court order, so already there have been communication in the two units, all the witnesses that have been testifying will be interviewed.” Rodrigues’s version of events contradicts other testimonies.
