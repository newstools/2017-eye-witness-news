                                         JOHANNESBURG - The University of Pretoria has condemned the use of derogatory and racist language following the release of a video showing two of the institution’s students using the k-word. The students can be heard using several profanities blaming a black person for stealing one of their cellphones. The university says it is still investigating the matter. The University of Pretoria has confirmed that the two are studying at the institution and they have been suspended. Two organisations linked to the pair have also cut ties with them. The Cyril Ramaphosa Education Trust withdrew one of the student’s bursaries while the Blue Bulls axed the other. Meanwhile, one of the students is reported to have apologised to her physiotherapy classmates saying what is displayed in the video doesn’t reflect her feelings.
