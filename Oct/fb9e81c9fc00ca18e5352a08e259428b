                                         JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) branches in Johannesburg have urged all members of the organisation to elect Cyril Ramaphosa as president of the ANC at the upcoming December conference. ANCYL branches celebrated their 73rd anniversary at the Hillbrow Theatre on Saturday. The deputy president delivered the keynote address and told the supportive crowd the youth league should prepare itself to lead. Songs, T-shirts and chants in support of Ramaphosa filled the hall. Former ANCYL  national executive committee member Abner Mosaasa believes Ramaphosa can save the ANC. “South Africans demand that we do the right thing in December. The right thing is to make Cyril Ramaphosa the president.” Ramaphosa told the ANCYL to elect leaders who will not abuse public resources. “We need cadres who will not steal and cadres who will not regard state resources, given to them to manage, as their own." The deputy president told ANCYL members to critically think about their decision when electing the next ANC leader at the December conference. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
