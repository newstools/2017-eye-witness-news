It’s alleged the pastor started raping the victim when she was 11 years old until she reported the matter to the police. It’s understood the victim was living with the suspect and his wife since she was three years old following the death of her mother. In a separate case, another pastor in the province is expected to appear in the Namakgale magistrates court this week for allegedly raping his 14-year-old step daughter. He was caught by his wife who immediately reported the matter to the police. Authorities say the suspect has been raping the victim since February 2015. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said, “The acting provincial commissioner has condemned these two incidents. Investigations are continuing.”
