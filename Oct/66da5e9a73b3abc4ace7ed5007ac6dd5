                                         CAPE TOWN - The sudden suspension of Home Affairs Director-General Mkuseli Apleni is expected to loom large over a meeting between lawmakers and the department on Tuesday. Home Affairs is scheduled to brief MPs on its Annual Report, but members of the portfolio committee are likely to push for answers about Apleni’s suspension. Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize took steps against her DG in September for failing to resolve legal disputes involving the department.  Democratic Alliance MP Hanniff Hoosen says he’ll be raising the issue of the DG’s suspension in Parliament on Tuesday. “I intend putting a few very straightforward questions to her… and expect her to give the committee a very straightforward response.” Committee chairperson Lemias Mashile expects the minister to attend the meeting. “I expect the debate about the DG to come up because Apleni is expected to present the Annual Report.” Apleni filed papers in the Pretoria High Court last week seeking an order to declare his suspension unconstitutional and invalid.
