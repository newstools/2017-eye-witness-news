                                         CAPE TOWN - North West provincial officials are not commenting on an order from Parliament to reverse a controversial donation of wildlife that was part of an empowerment project. According to media reports, politically connected business people benefitted from the provincial Environmental Affairs Department's donation of around a R100 million worth of animals that included sable antelopes and buffaloes. After investigating, Members of Parliament (MPs) concluded there's prima facie evidence that the donation didn't follow procedures. The environmental affairs portfolio committee wants MEC Manketse Tlhape to reverse the donation to the South African Rare Game Breeders Holdings. The committee's findings will now be sent to the National Assembly for adoption. Tlhape's department claims the donation was given to a "transformational partnership" consisting of breeders and entrepreneurs. Her department's spokesperson Emelda Sethlako is not commenting on the committee's decision. “We only saw the media releases, but we are still waiting for that report.” The committee's chairperson Philemon Mapulane says the anomalies are severe enough to warrant a probe by the Auditor-General and National Treasury. MPs will also get legal advice about whether to refer the matter to law enforcement agencies.
