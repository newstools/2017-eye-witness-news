                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Institute for Security Studies (ISS) says murder and armed robbery statistics are the most reliable of the crimes report in South Africa. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula released the statistics in Parliament on Tuesday, showing that murder has gone up by 1.8%, while aggravated robbery increased by 6.4%. The institute's Gareth Newham says these two categories are the most important when trying to determine trends in the country. “Other categories, such as sexual offences and all the other assaults, are very unreliable because for a number of years increasing numbers of victims are not reporting those crimes. So they might be going down but that’s just because fewer victims are reporting the crimes to the police.  "So we’ve seen increases again for the fifth consecutive year in murder and in robbery, and you need to look at this as an overall trend.” The institute says in the past five years the risk of being murdered in South Africa has increased by over 13%.  Newham says there were 3,500 more murders last year than there were five years ago. “That turns out to 52 murders a day on average, which 42 are men, seven are women and three are children – everyday. So that is a big concern for anybody who wants to know about public safety in South Africa.” WATCH: Mbalula briefs media
