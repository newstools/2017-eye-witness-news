                                         CAPE TOWN - The mother of a young boy who was shot by police says her son is struggling to sleep at night. The ordeal happened during a Hangberg protest  in Houtbay when young Ona was shot in the mouth. Pinky Dabule spoke of her ordeal on our sister station Kfm on Friday morning. “I was there at home and then someone called me and told me that Ona has been shot.” A video of police shooting him with a rubber bullet went viral on social media. An emotional Ona explains: “They shoot those guys then I go under that chair. I did pee and they shot me and I was crying, I was feeling the pain and then they shot me in the mouth here under the tongue. Sometimes I wake up and my mother tells me I'm saying ‘sorry, sorry, I didn’t do anything'.’”
