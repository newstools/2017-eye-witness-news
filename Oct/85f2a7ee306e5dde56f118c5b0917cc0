                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Black First Land First (BLF) says it is not deterred by Monday’s High Court ruling, as it expected the outcome. The High Court in Johannesburg has dismissed the BLF's application to appeal its contempt order, with costs. The group’s leader, Andile Mngxitama  was found to be in contempt of court in July, when he disrupted a media event, after being interdicted by the court from intimidating and threatening journalists. The BLF's Lindsay Maasdorp says they are not surprised by the ruling, as it proves that all courts in the country are captured. “All courts, the system of South Africa is premised by the capture of the state by white people. Doesn’t mean we don’t take up struggle within these constructs of oppression.” He says they will, however, escalate the matter to the appeals court. “We are hoping to achieve a measure that is just for black people where we can engage in particular processes and also be able to speak on particular matters without fear of favour and not be constructed as some people that are outside humanity.” Meanwhile, the South African National Editors Forum  says it supports the ruling, as it’s the court affirming the rule of law
