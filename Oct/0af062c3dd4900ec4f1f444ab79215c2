                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP), Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and Sanco have agreed that their alliance with the African National Congress (ANC) is currently at its lowest and have committed to addressing the matter through regular meetings.  President Jacob Zuma faced axed Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande for the first time since his recent Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday at the political alliance council meeting.  The meeting discussed the prerogative of the president, premiers and mayors to appoint and release members of Cabinet executive councils and mayoral committees.  However, the alliance partners stressed that the importance of appropriate consultation and input from the alliance on strategic decisions.  The meeting also expressed concerns about the ballooning debt levels and the consensus was that workersâ€™ assets in the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) must be treated with care.  The alliance also reconfirmed its commitment to the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture.  Meanwhile, ANC veteran Pallo Jordan has spoken about what lessons the ANC can take now from the late OR Tambo. This comes as residents of Nkantolo Village in the Eastern Cape where the late Tambo was born prepare to honour his legacy on Friday with the OR Tambo centenary national celebrations.  President Zuma is expected to officiate the celebrations outside Bizana.  Born on this day in 1917, Tambo would have turned 100-years-old this year. The government has also declared the year 2017, the year of Oliver Reginald Tambo.
