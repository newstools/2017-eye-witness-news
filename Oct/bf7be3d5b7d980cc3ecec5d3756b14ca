                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) has blamed white monopoly capital for the latest painting  of controversial artist Ayanda Mabulu, depicting ANC presidential hopeful Nkosazana-Dlamini-Zuma engaged in sexual activity. The painting also features President Jacob Zuma with his genitals exposed, holding a chain tied around his rape accuser Khwezi’s neck. Dlamini-Zuma who is half naked in the painting is seen lying on her back exposing her private parts. The women’s league says white monopoly capital is using a rented black painter to tarnish the image of its leaders, hoping it will stop them from implementing radical economic transformation policies. It says Mabulu is used and hidden behind media freedom and freedom of expression to advance malicious smear campaign.
