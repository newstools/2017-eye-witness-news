                                         CAPE TOWN - Members of Parliament (MPs) are grilling Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane over allegations of state capture. Zwane is appearing before Parliament’s Mineral Resources Committee at Parliament. It is one of four committees tasked to inquire into state capture and alleged undue influence by the Gupta family. Zwane first told MPs that the issue of state capture is already before the courts and claimed the matter was sub judice. “As I’ve said before, the matter is before a number of platforms. Legally, I may not be able to answer all your questions because that may prejudice me. And if I do so, do understand that I’m not doing so because I don’t want to answer.” MPs tackled Zwane over the Free State dairy farm run by the Gupta family, his appointment to Cabinet, allegedly at the behest of the Guptas and his trip to Switzerland allegedly to facilitate the sale of Optimum Coal mine to a Gupta company. The Democratic Alliance’s Hendrick Schmidt wanted to know about Zwane’s return from Zurich, allegedly on a Gupta-paid flight via Dubai, and why he missed his scheduled commercial flight back to South Africa. “You fly in an airplane paid for by the Guptas on whose behalf you just facilitated a sale of a mine, you stay in a hotel and drive a car all paid for by the Guptas. Now Mr Zwane, if that’s not conflict of interest, I’d like to know what conflict of interest is.” Zwane’s stonewalled or deflected a number of MPs’ questions, while the Economic Freedom Fighters has accused committee chairperson Zet Luzipho and other African National Congress MPs of trying to protect Zwane.
