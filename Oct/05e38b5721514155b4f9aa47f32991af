                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Health Ombudsman says former Gauteng health Mec Qedani Mahlangu and other government officials were “economical with the truth” while explaining their decision to move patients from Life Esidimeni  facilities.  He's confirmed 118 patients died between October 2016 and February this year as a result of the move.  One of the reasons Mahlangu gave for the move was that it would save the department money.  Solidarity’s Dirk Groenewald represents the families of three patients who died.  He asked Professor Malegapuru Makgoba whether he would agree that the families were lied to. “Professor, just a further point in respect of the families...” The professor said: “Lying is a deliberate, intentional process and I don’t think there could have been such an intention. Incompetence if often subconscious and not deliberate. Perhaps maybe to put it in gentler English, I would say they were economical with the truth.” On the stand on behalf of the state is Levy Mosenogi, the Gauteng Health Department’s chief director for planning, policy and research and the person who headed the project to move patients out of Esidimeni.
