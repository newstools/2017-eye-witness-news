                                         PRETORIA - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe  has warned against the African National Congress (ANC) being torn apart as it approaches its elective conference in December. President Jacob Zuma and Mugabe met during the second session of the South Africa Zimbabwe binational commission  in Pretoria earlier on Tuesday, joined by some of their ministers. With divisions at the party's top leadership, countless court cases disputing the legitimacy of the party's gatherings as well as political killings and violence amongst members, some analysts believe the ANC is imploding. Mugabe also seems to be concerned about the party. “I don’t know what we would be if all that future is rendered into nothingness, torn apart.” He’s wished the party well as it heads towards the conference in December, saying it must continue into the future renewed and strengthened.
