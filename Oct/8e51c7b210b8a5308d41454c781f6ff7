                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma will host his Zimbabwean counterpart President Robert Mugabe on Tuesday to discuss bilateral relations between their countries. This is the first time Mugabe is coming to South Africa since his wife Grace Mugabe was granted diplomatic immunity after being accused of assault. Rights group AfriForum has since taken the matter to court arguing that International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane misinterpreted the law when she granted the Zimbabwean first lady immunity. South Africa and Zimbabwe were engaged in a diplomatic feud after Police Minister Fikile Mbalula announced that the Zimbabwean first lady would hand herself over to the police and appear in court on allegations of assault. Last month Mugabe was also engaged in a feud with African National Congress Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe.  Mugabe had on two occasions told his Zanu-PF party supporters that Mandela only negotiated for his freedom from jail and not for the economic emancipation of the majority black people. Mantashe lodged a formal complaint with his ZANU PF counterpart over President Robert Mugabe's comments on South Africa accusing the president of making unresearched statements. Mugabe then described Mantashe’s reaction to his negative comments as “stupid”. EWN earlier reported that Mugabe  has reportedly arrived in the country.
