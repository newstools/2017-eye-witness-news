                                         JOHANNESBURG – The South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) says it notes with concern the recent electricity tariff hike request by Eskom. The power utility has applied for a 19.9% tariff hike for its direct customers and a 25% hike for customers who receive their electricity from municipalities.  The union says the requested hike would not be affordable to ordinary citizens, particularly given the country’s high levels of unemployment and poverty.  It says that the increase will further result in consequential increases of food and transport.  Samwu that says it will be writing to the regulator urging it to reject this request as it would simply be unaffordable to the majority of South Africans. General secretary Simon Mathe says: “We believe that the request is not justified, there should be no increase whatsoever that is extended to Eskom.  “In fact, until such time a that Eskom has proved beyond reasonable doubt that they are able to manage their funds very well.”
