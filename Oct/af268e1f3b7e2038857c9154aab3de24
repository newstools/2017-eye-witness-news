                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the conduct of Police Minister Fikile Mbalula and SA Police Service (SAPS) members involved in the arrest of ten men on the N1 highway is a serious violation of the suspects’ human and Constitutional rights. Police pulled over a group of men near the Huguenot Tunnel last weekend, cable tied their hands and forced them to lie face down on the side of the road for hours. Police suspected the men of being connected to the murder of 11 people in Philippi two weeks ago. They were later released without being charged. During last weekend’s police operation, Mbalula took to Twitter posting a photo of the men handcuffed and lying face down on the ground alongside the highway. It turns out the men were part of a funeral convoy transporting the remains of a friend to the Eastern Cape. Mbalula maintains police did nothing wrong, adding the deceased whose coffin was also apparently searched during the operation was a suspect. The DA’s Phumzile van Damme said: “We will be writing to the South African Human Rights Commission and Independent Police Investigative Directorate, asking them to launch a full investigation into the matter.” Van Damme adds it’s not the first time Mbalula has posted photos of arrested people on social media before they have appeared in court. The faces of some have been clearly visible. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
