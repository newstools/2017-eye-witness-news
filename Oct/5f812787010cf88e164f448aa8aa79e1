                                            The New Zealand team beat SA’s national team by just one point in a thrilling match that ended with a 24-25 score. 
                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Springboks might have put in a much-improved performance compared to the last time they faced the All Blacks (a 57-0 thrashing Down under), but they again lost out to New Zealand 24-25 at Newlands on Saturday evening. After South Africa opened the scoring with a penalty through Elton Jantjies, the All Blacks hit back with a penalty of their own through Beauden Barrett to level matters at 3-3.  It was a cagey opening to the rest of the first half, with the Boks living dangerously after the TMO ruled a New Zealand try as a knock-on. Eventually, the visitors continued pressure paid off though, with Ryan Crotty crossing the whitewash to give the visitors an 8-3 lead at the halftime break. The second half was all about trading the lead though, with both sides putting on a great showing and South African tries coming for Ross Cronje, Jean-Luc du Preez and Malcolm Marx, while the All Blacks found second-half tries courtesy of Ioane and McKenzie to seal the win. In the end Springbok coach Allister Coetzee will look at a couple of moments that led to the loss, which will certainly include the interception that led to Ioane’s try, as well as a late challenge from Damian de Allende which got him sent off in the closing stages of the match. Nonetheless, Bok fans will rightly feel a lot more positive about the state of South African rugby following an impressive performance which should at least go a few steps towards improving the mood in the Springbok camp at the end of an eventful Rugby Championship 2017.
