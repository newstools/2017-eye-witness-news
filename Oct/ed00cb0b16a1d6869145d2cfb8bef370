                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng police have arrested three men linked to the murder of a deputy principal at a Duduza Primary School. The men allegedly gained entry to the school under false pretences last week and shot and killed deputy principal Herbet Nyembe before driving off. Information led the Ekurhuleni East task team to Tsakane and Kwa Thema on Monday morning where the trio was handcuffed. The police's Kay Makhubele has commended the Duduza community for tip-offs that led to the arrests. “Since the commission of the crime, the police have been following all the leads which led the police to the arrest of three suspects in Tsakane and KwaThema.  "During the arrest, an unlicensed firearm which is believed to have been used in the commission of the crime, was recovered. So far the motive for the killing is unknown.” Duduza community members say they have been robbed of a selfless leader and want justice for 55-year-old Herbert Nyembe's grieving family. The department has provided the Edalinceba primary school staff and pupils with counselling to help them cope in the aftermath of the murder.
