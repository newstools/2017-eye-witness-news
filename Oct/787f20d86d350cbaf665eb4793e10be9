                                         CAPE TOWN - A former resident of the estate where the Van Breda family murders occurred says she didn’t hear anything strange on the evening of the tragedy. Henri van Breda is on trial for the murders of his parents and older brother, and for the attempted killing of his sister in their home on 27 January 2015. Annelize Taljaard lived in Goske Street with her three children, a stone’s throw from the Van Breda family home. Taljaard has told the court she was asleep by 10pm on the night of 26 January 2015. Stephanie Op’t Hof, who lived in 10 Goske Street, has previously testified to hearing men’s voices coming from the Van Breda house that night. But Taljaard, who’s described herself as a light sleeper, has told the court she didn’t hear anything out of the ordinary. Taljaard says she’d always considered the estate safe, so much so that she’d leave her sleeping children every morning to go for a swim and she was surprised when she heard of the attacks.
