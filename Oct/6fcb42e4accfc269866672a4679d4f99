                                         CAPE TOWN - The Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry says President Jacob Zuma is putting his own personal interests before the country, the economy and the poor. Reacting to Zuma's latest Cabinet shake-up, they body's representatives highlight that South Africa has now had three Energy Ministers within the space of one year.  Zuma in March kicked-out Tina Joemat-Petterssen and replaced her with Mmamaloko Khubayi.  On Tuesday, he put former State Security Minister David Mahlobo in the portfolio. This move has generated a lot criticism, as Mahlobo doesn't have experience to head this department. President of the chamber, Janine Myburgh, says: “This dramatic change came at a time when Eskom refused to sign agreements with independent power producers. The nuclear deal seems to be on again despite rejection by the courts and the country’s energy experts.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
