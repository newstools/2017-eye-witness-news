                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has again slammed rampant corruption in parastatals. Ramaphosa delivered the keynote address at the Western Cape African National Congress (ANC)’s OR Tambo centenary commemoration in Cape Town this past weekend.  He assured supporters and delegates that corrupt individuals will be booted from the ruling party.  The ANC presidential candidate has vowed that the organisation will eradicate corruption from state-owned enterprises, saying that this is not what Tambo would have wanted.  “He did not want to see what’s happening in our state-owned enterprises today, where money is being stolen left, right and centre.”  He went all out to assure supporters at the Every Nation Christ Church in Goodwood that the ruling party will recover from the challenges it faces. “The real challenge is that we must take a mirror and look at ourselves. We need to ask ourselves whether we’re living up to OR Tambo’s values.” Ramaphosa also touched on other issues regarding racism, tertiary tuition fees and gender-based violence.
