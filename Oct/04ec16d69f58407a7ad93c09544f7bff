                                         JOHANNESBURG - Axed higher education minister Blade Nzimande says he's not surprised that President Jacob Zuma fired him from his portfolio. Nzimande became a causality of Zuma's latest reshuffle and is the only minister who was completely removed from Cabinet.  He says President Zuma did not hand him a report of the fees commission looking into the feasibility of free higher education. Nzimande says the signs for his removal were imminent.  “One must respect how the president chooses to deal with that but I just found it completely out of order and that’s why I was not surprised that I was fired. All the signs were there.”
