                                         JOHANNESBURG - At the start of final exams, the African National Congress Youth League is calling on the Basic Education Department  to ensure that matric papers are kept secure at all times. The youth league says the leaking of matric papers has in the past years compromised and delayed learning for pupils. The league's Mlondi Mkhize says the department should consider appointing an independent security company. “We don’t want to have those incidences happening this time around. That’s why we’re encouraging the department to tighten its security. If it means that sourcing outside the security of the department to ensure that exam papers are secured without any leaks, that will be highly appreciated.”
