                                         JOHANNESBURG - The High Court has dismissed the urgent application by six former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillors who were expelled from the Mogale City Municipality. The EFF leadership decided to sack the councillors after they defied the party's decision and voted with the African National Congress to pass the Mogale City budget. The six councillors want to stop the Independent Electoral Commission from removing their names from the proportional representation list, pending the outcome of an internal EFF process. They also want to stop the commission removing them from the municipality. Their lawyer, Katleho Mofokeng, says the court dismissed the urgency of their case, but they will proceed with the application. “We’re going to file the matter tomorrow at the same court in Johannesburg. We’ll request that the IEC should not seal those positions pending the finalisation of the EFF’s internal processes.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
