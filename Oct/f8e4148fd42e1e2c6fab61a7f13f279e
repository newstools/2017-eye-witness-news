                                         JOHANNESBURG - The two men convicted in the so called "coffin assault" case have been sentenced to periods of 11 and 14 years in prison respectively. They received various sentences for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, intimidation and attempted murder.   Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson forced Rethabile Mlotshwa into a coffin, threatening to set it alight. The attack was caught on video, sparking outrage across the country. Willem Oosthuizen was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment, five of which are suspended for eight years on condition that he's not found guilty of any other offense. His co-accused Theo Jackson was handed a 19-year jail term, with five years suspended on similar terms. The accused are appealing the judgement.
