                                         JOHANNESBURG – Broadcasting, Electronic, Media & Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) is threatening to strike at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) to raise their concerns about the state of the public broadcaster. This comes as the so-called a group of journalists alleges that the Presidency spokesperson Bongani Nqulunga had a secret meeting with the acting head of news Nyana Molote. The so-called SABC 8 claim the meeting was to affirm the SABC news division as a propaganda tool for the African National Congress. The union’s Hannes du Buisson says they are speaking to members to weigh up their options. “The SABC staff are very upset, very negative about what is happening at the SABC. Currently, remember that they have gone without the salary increase, with no proper governance structure. Nothing can really happen at the SABC because of no board in place.” Meanwhile, Ngqulunga says the President Jacob Zuma is concerned about the independence of the public broadcaster. “But it also concerns us about the impact in the SABC newsroom and the possible intimidation of professional and independent journalists at the public broadcaster.”
