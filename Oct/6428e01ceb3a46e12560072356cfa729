Ramaphosa was warmly received by the former MK combatants who nodded and agreed with much of his sentiments.  He says the ANC is in a dangerous place and needs selfless leaders with accountability. â€œWe need cadres who will not steal and cadres who will not regard state resources, given to them to manage, as their own." Ramaphosa says the elective conference could see the rebirth of the ANC or its death. #MKCouncil Cheering and singing for Ramaphosa as he leaves.
