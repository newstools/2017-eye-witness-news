                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) says it will not provide the ID numbers of its leaders, including its president Collen Maine, to prove that they are still within the right age to lead the organisation. Two former ANCYL members from Gauteng and North West have, through their lawyers, written to the league and its mother body challenging Maine’s eligibility, arguing that he is above the required age limit. They have threatened to go to court if the ANCYL doesn’t furnish them with the ages of Maine and other Youth League leaders. According to the League’s Constitution, its membership is open to people under the age of 35. League General-Secretary Njabulo Nzuza said: “As an organisation, we’re not at liberty to hand out personal information of our members to any third party.” ANCYL TO DEFEND MAINE The ANCYL says it will defend Maine against those who want him to resign merely because he is older than the required age to be a member of the Youth League. Those threatening to take the structure to court argue that Maine is not the only one in the ANCYL national executive committee, who has exceeded the age limit. But Nzunza says they will defend Maine. “Comrade Maine will deliver the political report come September 2018 or at the next conference of the organisation.” While the league says Maine is older than 35, it says he can still continue to lead the organisation because other former leaders also did the same.
