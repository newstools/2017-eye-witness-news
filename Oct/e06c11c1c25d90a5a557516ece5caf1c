                                         CAPE TOWN – The Police Ministry hasn’t given specific timeframes as to when soldiers will be deployed to help in crime-fighting efforts. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has requested the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to step in to help the South African Police Service in crime-plagued areas in the Western Cape and Gauteng. Mbalula’s spokesperson Vuyo Mhaga says: “We can’t give specifics, we’re making a request, so the decision has to be taken by these two parties, which is the Minister of Defence as well as the president. “But we’re quite hopeful that in the next few weeks we’ll be able to see the army.” Western Cape Premier Helen Zille this week also made fresh calls for the military to be brought in to address gangsterism. Mbalula has intensified the fight against violent crime by getting the SANDF to assist. He says that some criminals also have military training and use weapons of war to execute the crime. In a statement, Mbalula also remarks on the toll this takes on innocent bystanders paying with their lives. His spokesperson, Vuyo Mhaga, says that the situation requires urgent intervention. “This is to augment some of the work that the Western Cape police have been doing, the relaunch of the TRT, and the two provinces remain stubborn in terms of crime. “Soldiers will be deployed in specific areas in the two provinces, especially in Cape Town.” Mbalula has been active in various crime-ridden communities since he became Police Minister in March.
