                                         CAPE TOWN – An eyewitness says that he’s been left traumatised following a shooting incident that claimed the lives of two people and left one wounded at the Cubana Lounge in Stellenbosch this past weekend. The 30-year-old wife and mother of two, Nicole Muller, died after she sustained a bullet wound to the head during the hit. A 40-year-old man, Donovan Jacobs, from Delft, also died after he was shot three times. It is believed that Donovan Jacobs was the target in the frantic shooting at the Plein Street social hang-out in Stellenbosch. According to an eyewitness, Muller was on the dance floor at the time that the killer opened fire. “The first three shots were fired right towards the dance floor because that’s where the guy they were chasing ran into. That’s where they shot one girl.” He says the music kept playing while the sound of multiple gunshots rang from the kitchen area where Jacobs was killed. “I was standing where the whole the shooting was happening because I was just confused and my friend ducked. When I saw the guy also coming, I immediately ducked to hide from him.” No students were injured during the attack, but Stellenbosch University's SRC has made counselling available to those who were in the Cubana at the time.
