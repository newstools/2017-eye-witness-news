                                         HARARE - Zimbabwe’s main opposition party has strongly criticised a decision by the new finance minister to buy more than 200 new vehicles for traditional chiefs. The development comes ahead of a conference of the chiefs on Saturday, which President Robert Mugabe is expected to attend. In a statement, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party says the purchase of these 226 new vehicles from South Africa is blatant vote-buying. President Robert Mugabe is expected to meet the chiefs in Bulawayo on Saturday. They’re the ones in line to get these new cars and these leaders are key allies of the ruling party in its rural strongholds. The MDC says that there are other needs that should take priority. The party says most district hospitals don’t even have ambulances. A news report in September said former finance minister Patrick Chinamasa had argued that there wasn’t enough money to buy these vehicles, but he’s just been replaced in a cabinet reshuffle.
