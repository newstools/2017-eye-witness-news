                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Gauteng Premier David Makhura's  role in the transfer of Esidimeni mental health patients that led to 141 deaths must be probed. This follows former Mental Health Review Board director Dumazile Masondo’s claims that at the Esidimeni arbitration hearings that Makhura had attended meetings on the move of the patients. She also claimed that former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu told her she was “getting orders from above” on the Esidimeni project. The DA says this flatly contradicts Makhura's claim that he didn’t know that the patients were sent to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) but were going to other state health facilities. Makhura is due to testify at the hearings along with Mahlangu whose whereabouts is still not clear. DA shadow health MEC Jack Bloom says: “New evidence has emerged that Gauteng Premier David Makhura was aware of the transfers to unsuitable NGOs where the people died. I think that Premier Makhura needs to be closely questioned at the arbitration hearing because ultimately he was the head of the government under which this happened.”
