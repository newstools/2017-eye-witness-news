                                         CAPE TOWN – Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille has assured residents of the drought-affected city  that municipal officials have initiated plans to prevent taps running dry. De Lille visited the City's newest desalination plant at the V&A Waterfront on Sunday morning. Dams supplying water to the city are dangerously low; with levels currently sitting at around 28%. The City’s V&A Waterfront desalination facility is set to start delivering two million litres of water daily by February 2018.  The mayor says electricity infrastructure for the site will be rolled out as from November. “We are in a drought-stricken area and we will continue to plan for the drought, even though we might be getting winter rains.” She says eight other desalination sites are also planned for the metro. “In Hout Bay, we will produce 4 million litres of water a day, and in Granger Bay 8 million litres of water and Red Hill we will produce about 2 litres of water per day.” Officials gave the assurance water will be safe for human consumption.
