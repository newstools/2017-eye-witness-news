                                         JOHANNESBURG - An Uber driver and client who were caught in the middle of a protest by metered taxi drivers have criticised the manner in which the police allegedly looked on while their cars were being petrol bombed. More than 30 protesters were handcuffed and charged for public violence after barricading the R21 and R24 highways near OR Tambo International Airport on Friday. WATCH: #HighwayProtest: Roads blocked and 2 Uber cars torched  Two Uber cars were torched, while some drivers and occupants threatened and assaulted. An Uber driver, who doesn’t want to be named, says police could have done more to prevent the violence and intimidation. “A normal human being who went to school to learn about this will be able to see when someone is doing something wrong. They should have asked those guys why they were doing that.” A woman who was travelling in an Uber car with her husband has described how she was pulled out by the vehicle and insulted. “I was pulled out by the belt of my pants and I managed to get back in again.” She has also called for Uber drivers to receive more training.
