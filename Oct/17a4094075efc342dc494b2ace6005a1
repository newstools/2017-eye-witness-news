                                         PARLIAMENT - Lawmakers probing state capture at Eskom have been told that whistle-blowers, including those at the parastatal, have received death threats if they go public with information. The Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises has on Tuesday kicked off its inquiry into Eskom with a presentation from University of Cape Town Professor Anton Eberhard who has authored a booklet about instances of governance failure and state capture at the power utility. It follows revelations in leaked emails of influence peddling by the Gupta family to score lucrative state contracts. The much-anticipated inquiry into Eskom got underway on Tuesday with Eberhard providing lawmakers with context for their probe. It’s expected that MPs will call Eskom employees, Minister Lynne Brown and those implicated in state capture but the official witness list is being kept under wraps for security reasons. Eberhard told the committee that people have been warned not to come forward with information. “Death threats have been made against individuals, including two people within Eskom.” Eberhard said a fundamental task of the inquiry would be to expose how the board and senior management appointments have been subsumed by a “political project” serving a corrupt elite.
