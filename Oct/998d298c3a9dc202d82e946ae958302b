                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says the contestation of positions and leadership in the ruling party should be done in a democratic manner. Dlamini-Zuma was speaking at the ANC Limpopo Cadres Forum in Giyane on Saturday afternoon. She was recently sworn in as a Member of Parliament, however, continues on her campaign trail to the partyâ€™s top position. Dlamini-Zuma says the integrity and the unity of the ANC can only be restored through humility, commitment and focus. Meanwhile, Dlamini-Zuma has encouraged the people of Limpopo to use agriculture in the province to create jobs. She says more still needs to be done when it comes to the distribution of land in the country.  Dlamini-Zuma says minerals in the province are not benefiting the majority of the people.
