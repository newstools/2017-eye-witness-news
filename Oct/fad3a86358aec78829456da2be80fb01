                                         CAPE TOWN - A Wellington policeman says that there were no signs to suggest forced entry when he arrived at the home of slain author Winnie Rust. Nigel and Johannes Plaaitjies are accused of robbing and killing the 77-year-old at her home last May. Nigel Plaaitjies has pleaded guilty to robbing the woman but he denies killed her, while his uncle denies all the charges against him. Constable Johannes Davids was on patrol when he responded to the crime scene. The policeman says that there were no signs of a house robbery, adding that the doors and windows were closed and nothing in the house appeared to have been tampered with. Meanwhile, the court has heard that the accused allegedly went on a shopping spree in Paarl on the day that Rust was killed.   The State argues that the men used Rustâ€™s bank cards to purchase expensive items including clothes, cellphones and jewellery. Three shop assistants have been called to the witness stand to verify the claims. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
