                                         DURBAN - African National Congress (ANC) treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize says that the tensions with the alliance partners as a result of the sudden Cabinet shake-up will be addressed in meetings expected to take place this week. Mkhize was speaking at a multi-stakeholder dinner on Tuesday night in Pietermaritzburg where he celebrated the life of OR Tambo. The ANC treasurer-general says that there’s been sensationalist media reporting about whether the top six was consulted by President Jacob Zuma ahead of his latest move. “It was reported that Mkhize said we were stunned and all of that. I think there’s been a lot of sensationalising of what we had said.”  Mkhize says work still needs to be done to restore unity in the alliance.
