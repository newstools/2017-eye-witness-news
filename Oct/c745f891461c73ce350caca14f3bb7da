                                         CAPE TOWN â€“ Voting has officially concluded as the Democratic Alliance (DA) electing its new leadership in the Western Cape on Saturday. DA leader Mmusi Maimane has delivered the keynote speech  at the party's Western Cape congress  in Goodwood outside the Mother City. Almost 1,000 delegates registered to vote for their provincial leadership as the votes for the new DA provincial leadership are being tallied at this hour. Hundreds of delegates could be seen queueing in the different lines shortly after party leader Maimane delivered his speech.  Maimane has reiterated his calls for the African National Congress (ANC) to be removed from government. He claims the reason why South Africans are rejecting the ruling party, is because the ANC does not care about people. Maimane got loud cheers after telling the crowd that any democracy relies on change if it's going to succeed. He told delegates it's time for the DA to bring about that change.
