                                         CAPE TOWN – The National Consumer Commission says it is launching an investigation into whether hake is being passed off as haddock. This follows a call from a listener who questioned why haddock in South Africa is actually smoked hake. The commission’s Trevor Hattingh says they will be making an assessment of the entire industry to determine how widespread the problem is. “The truth of the matter is that this is misleading advertising; a typical case of misleading advertising. One can’t pass off hake as haddock to make it attractive to consumers for commercial reasons.”
