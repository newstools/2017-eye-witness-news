                                         JOHANNESBURG - Statistician-General Pali Lehohla says that universities are made more expensive because they retain more students than they produce graduates. He says the country's higher education institutions and TVET colleges have an average intake of 150,000 students annually, but retain about 800,000 students. Lehohla says that while the rate of graduates has increased steadily, many have only received certificates not degrees. He says the state of the university system should concern South Africans as its production ratio is wasteful. Lehohla says that a lack of funding is further compounding this weakened system. “The fundamental problem in South Africa is around engaging, to ensure that the human resources we have are transformed into resources that are productive. This transforms education. The fees commission is central.” He says that while women remain on the higher side of graduating students, the number of black and coloured graduates is steadily declining.
