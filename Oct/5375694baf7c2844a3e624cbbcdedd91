                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) veteran Siphiwe Nyanda says the ANC cannot continue with Jacob Zuma as president of the party and the country, following Friday's Supreme Court of Appeals ruling.  Nyanda was speaking on the sidelines of the party's veterans league congress in Boksburg. The former uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) general is leading a group of the party's disgruntled former soldiers under the banner of the MK Council. The MK council has previously called on President Jacob Zuma  to step down. Earlier, Secretary General Gwede Mantashe  asked the veterans to give them advice on how to deal with the Spy Tapes ruling. Nyanda has done just that. He said: "The ANC would really have to sit and think about how they proceed with a president who is facing so many charges, so many serious charges.‚Äù  He says as veterans they hope the National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams will exercise independence and do the right thing, which means taking a decision according to his conscience.
