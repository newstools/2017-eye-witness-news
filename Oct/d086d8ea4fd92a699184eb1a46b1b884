                                         JOHANNESBURG – Women and Men Against Child Abuse says the South African criminal justice system doesn’t favour sexual abuse victims. The NGO lashed out at two Pretoria High Court judges on Thursday after they overturned the life sentence of a convicted rapist. The Lydenburg man forced his six-year-old stepdaughter to re-enact scenes from porn movies with him over several years. The judges this week cut the man’s jail term from life to 20 years, saying he only forced the girl to perform oral sex on him which they believe did not constitute the most serious case of rape. The NGO’s Miranda Jordan-Friedman says this is evidence that the system doesn’t make it easy for rape victims. Jordan-Friedman says the judgment is shocking and shows the lack of education from the judges.“It is all the same, the betrayal, the same and obviously our judges are very uneducated.” She says community members should join her in submitting papers to the judiciary in pressing them to change the status quo.
