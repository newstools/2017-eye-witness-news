                                         JOHANNESBURG - Both Glenn Agliotti and Adriano Mazzotti have told Eyewitness News that they are considering their legal options and are meeting with lawyers on Monday in response to claims made about them in a book written by veteran journalist Jacques Pauw. Pauw has alleged that Mazzotti is a self-confessed smuggler, fraudster and money launderer and is contributing to African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma's political campaign. He also claims that Agliotti bragged about running a state sponsored cigarette smuggling operation with the president's blessing. Carnilinx boss Adriano Mazzotti says that he is considering what action to take against Pauw's slanderous allegations. He's meeting with his lawyers on Monday and going through his notes to establish what his options are. He has denied claims that he is funding Dlamini Zuma's campaign and says that he has never been convicted of any crime. In his book, Pauw says Mazzotti signed an affidavit in May 2014 admitting complicity in a host of crimes, including fraud, money laundering, corruption, tax evasion and bribery. The outspoken Economic Freedom Fighters and Julius Malema backer says he is not funding Dlamini Zuma's campaign although he does admit to having met her once in Europe. Agliotti says that he is also meeting with his lawyers on Monday to decide what action to take. He says that the recording quoted in Pauw's book about a meeting with cigarette industry players is seven-years-old and this is a stale story that is being rehashed.
