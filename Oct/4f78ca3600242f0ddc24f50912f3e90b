                                         CAPE TOWN – The Nelson Mandela Bay metro says it will be phasing out its contract with auditing firm, KPMG within the next three months. This follows the scandal that’s rocked the auditing firm over its questionable South African Revenue Service rogue unit report and its alleged links with a Gupta family company. The Economic Freedom Fighters brought a motion at a full council meeting on Thursday, calling for the immediate termination of the contract. But chairperson of the Municipality’s Public Accounts Committee Lance Grootboom says more time is needed to takeover internal auditing functions. “This is not something that’s going to begin immediately that’s why we developed an exit strategy that’s going to be for three months so that there can be a proper handover process taking place.”
