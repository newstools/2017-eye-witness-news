                                         JOHANNESBURG - Record label Mabala Noise  is blaming the weather in Johannesburg for delays at the Migos Culture Tour. Thousands of concert goers who gathered at The Dome on Saturday to watch the American rap group and several local artists were left disappointed when the concert started late and some acts didn't even perform. The record label says when the storm hit some of the access control points ticket accreditation systems were severely impacted. The label's Sikhulile Nzuza says they had to stop the show for two hours for safety reasons, which is why some artists didn't perform. "People will push even harder when they see that ‘Oh AKA is on stage, I don’t want to miss AKA’s performance’. They’ll push even harder to get in and it would have caused a commotion outside. So it was entirely [up] to the safety officer and the fire chief.
