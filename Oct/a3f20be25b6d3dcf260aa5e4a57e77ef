                                         CAPE TOWN - Security upgrades at Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille’s private residence have revealed tensions between herself and Mayco member JP Smith. De Lille on Monday accused Smith of dragging her name through the mud in his strive for sensationalism. In a statement released on Monday, she says her lawyers have been briefed about what she labels malicious and defamatory remarks by Smith and some members of the city’s Internal Investigations Unit. In a statement, De Lille refers to news articles regarding security upgrades at her private residence. She says this project was undertaken following a security assessment by the South African Police Service. Officials say proper supply chain management processes were followed to procure the necessary safety equipment. But added upgrades to the building infrastructure have been paid for by De Lille herself. De Lille says Smith is out of line by releasing statements that the Metro Police Department is responsible for crime fighting, saying he wants to play cowboys and crooks. She says she has expressed her grievance to Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane. Smith says he’s been told by party leadership not to comment. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
