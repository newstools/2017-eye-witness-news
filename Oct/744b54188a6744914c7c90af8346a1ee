                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) is calling for the sacking of South African Revenue Service (Sars)  Commissioner Tom Moyane, saying he's tainted the revenue service's reputation and allowed wrongdoing. The communist party claims that Moyane has allowed rogue elements to flourish at the institution, with allegations of collusion with syndicates, including those in the tobacco industry. It says the announcement by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba that the country will experience a R50 billion tax revenue shortfall is another reason why Moyane must be axed. The SACP’s Solly Mapaila says there's a lot of rot at the revenue service. “Sars has allowed rogue elements inside the system to actually collude with criminal syndicates, including those in the tobacco industry.”
