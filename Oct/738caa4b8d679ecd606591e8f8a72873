                                         DURBAN – The father of former Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa says he is beginning to lose hope that his son's killers will ever be brought to book. A memorial service for the slain soccer star is being held at his home in Umlazi, south of Durban. Meyiwa was shot at his girlfriend’s home in what appeared to be a botched robbery in Vosloorus three years ago. Dozens of church members have been singing hymns during a memorial service to commemorate the third year since Meyiwa’s murder. His father Sam says he believes the police and those who were in the room on that fatal day are being bribed into silence. “They are bribing the cops. There is a father who pays bribes in order to protect his son who is one of the six people who were in the room on that day." #SenzoMeyiwa [WATCH]Sam Meyiwa says he knows people have been bribed to cover up the murder & those responsible now want to kill him too.ZN pic.twitter.com/LPqxhOK6sY  Meyiwa senior says despite high-ranking police officials who have continued to make empty promises about solving his son’s case, he believes Minister Mbalula will make a difference this time around. #SenzoMeyiwa father Sam Meyiwa outside the family home in Umlazi.
