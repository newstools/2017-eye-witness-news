                                         JOHANNESBURG - Newly-appointed Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi says institutional memory and policy certainty are enough to ensure stability in government departments despite President Jacob Zuma’s multiple Cabinet reshuffles. This comes after the president’s recent reshuffle, that has seen changes to the Cabinet including Kubayi being moved from the energy department to communications. She says there is no apparent change and that she is just taking over from where former Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo left off. “There won’t be a change of policies. I will carry on from where Dlodlo left.” Kubayi says a minister's responsibility when taking over a department is to implement whatever is in the annual performance plan.
