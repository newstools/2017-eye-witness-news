                                         CAPE TOWN - One of the men on trial for a Khayelitsha womanâ€™s rape and murder has been accused of lying about police brutality. Sinoxolo Mafevuka was murdered last year at the age of 19. Cousins, Xolisa and Athabile Mafilika are standing trial in the Western Cape High Court. During Xolisa Mafilika's testimony on Thursday, he denied witnesses' claims that he was near the communal toilets where Mafevuka's body was found. Mafilika claimed he was sleeping in his shack on the night of her murder. He told the court that the shack's layout makes it impossible for him to walk to and from his room without his housemate seeing him. Prosecutor Ralph Zeeman brought up Mafilika's claims that he was assaulted by investigating officer Batiki Tshabalala when he was taken into custody. Zeeman said the doctor who examined Mafilika did not see any injuries on his body and argued that the accused must have lied about the assault. Mafilika, however, described the alleged assault in detail, adding that the doctor never examined him. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
