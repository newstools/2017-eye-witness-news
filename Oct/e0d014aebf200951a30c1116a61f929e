                                         JOHANNESBURG – The suspended Congress of the People (Cope) leader in Limpopo, Patrick Sikutshi, has approached the Polokwane High Court seeking an urgent court interdict against his suspension. Sikhutshi was suspended from the party for alleged misappropriation of party funds. Cope says he will remain suspended pending the party’s internal investigations. The suspended leader says he’s being targeted for raising a motion of no confidence – which was supported by many cope members – against the party’s president Mosiuoa Lekota. Cope is expected to oppose the application. Spokesperson Glacier Nkhwashu says: “Cope will not tolerate corruption, personal greed and the violation of the values of the Constitution of our land. We promised that our leaders will be liable, accountable and incorruptible.”
