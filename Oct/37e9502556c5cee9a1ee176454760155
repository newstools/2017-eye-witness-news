                                         MIDDELBURG - The High Court sitting in Middelburg has dismissed the appeal application of the duo accused in the coffin assault case. Earlier on Friday, the court heard an application for leave to appeal application by the legal counsel for Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen. The two men convicted in the so-called coffin assault case were on Friday morning sentenced to periods of 11 and 14 years in prison respectively. They received various sentences for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, intimidation and attempted murder for forcing Rethabile Mlotshwa into a coffin and threatening to set it alight. While handing down sentencing, Judge Sheila Mphahlele called the attack inhumane and disgusting. "However, the evidence before court indicates that the seriousness of the offence far outweighst the mitigating factors and the personal factors of the offenders. The conduct of the accused fuelled social division and racial tension." Willem Oosthuizen was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment, five of which are suspended for eight years on condition that he's not found guilty of any other offense. His co-accused Theo Jackson was handed a 19-year jail term, with five years suspended on similar terms. #CoffinAssaultCase Judge Sheila Mphahlele has dismissed the Appeal application of duo accused in the coffin assault case.
