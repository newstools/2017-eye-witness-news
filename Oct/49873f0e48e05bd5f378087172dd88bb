                                         CAPE TOWN - Eyewitness News understands Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille won't be participating in the voting process to elect a new provincial DA leader. De Lille, along with Mayco member JP Smith, has been placed on special leave and therefore banned from party activities following a recent public spat.  Both have been allowed to cast a special vote ahead of the DA's provincial elective congress in Goodwood today. Smith arrived at 7 am to cast his vote and left shortly thereafter. De lille was expected to do the same. It's believed she has snubbed the process and, according to sources at the event, apparently sent an email last night, indicating she won't be participating.  Meanwhile, there’s a hive of activity here at the Every Nation Christ Church in Goodwood with party leader Mmusi Maimane expected to arrive soon. Voting is scheduled to end at noon. More than 1,000 delegates are expected to attend the congress where a new provincial leader will be elected.  They will be voting for either interim leader Housing MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela or Lennit Max, a former police commissioner and MPL. Several high profile party members will be noticeably absent at the DA congress, including former national leader Premier Helen Zille who is abroad and will vote by email. Max says if he's able to oust Madikizela, he will deal decisively with disciplinary matters. “I'm hands on and I want to address it immediately before it escalates to a point where it damages the party's brand.” Whoever is elected will be expected to guide the party to even greater margins in 2019 elections.
