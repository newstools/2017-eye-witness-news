                                         CAPE TOWN - Former president Kgalema Motlanthe says that the African National Congress (ANC)'s elective conference processes are “flawed”. The ANC veteran doesn't see himself attending the all-important gathering in December. Motlanthe has hinted at alleged manipulation and interference in the ANC's elective conference processes. Motlanthe says that 90% of all the delegates at the conference must comprise of those elected at branch level. He says this hasn't happened. “Once all of those processes are disregarded and delegates are not elected by members but are handpicked by leaders on the basis of perceived support to their candidates. It defeats the whole purpose of the majority of delegates being delegates from branches.” Motlanthe says he can't say whether he's backing any candidate, as he doesn't have faith in the processes that have been followed. “Because the processes are flawed, it's really pointless to even hope that the outcomes of such flawed processes would be representative of the collective views of the membership. It can produce any outcome." (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
