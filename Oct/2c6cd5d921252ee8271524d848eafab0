                                         CAPE TOWN - The ex-boyfriend of convicted child murderer Anthea Kleynhans could also be facing prosecution. On Tuesday, the Western Cape High Court found Kleynhans guilty of the murder of three-year old Laché Stols and of child abuse. Stols died after she was beaten by Kleynhans in January 2012 in Blackheath.  Anthea Kleynhans has told the court that she was drunk when she assaulted the girl for soiling herself. But Judge Nolwazi Boqwana found that there was intent from Kleynhans to kill the child. Boqwana also found that the testimony of the girl's father, Angelo Stols, was not entirely true and he will have to be recalled to the witness stand. She said she can't see how Stols didn't know of the abuse his daughter suffered, especially since other family members had told him about it. The girl's relative Catherine Greenfield says that the family is relieved the matter is finally over. “We’ve been waiting for five years for this day. Finally, we have closure.” Boqwana ordered Kleynhans, who'd been out on bail, to be held in police custody until sentencing proceedings start in December. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
