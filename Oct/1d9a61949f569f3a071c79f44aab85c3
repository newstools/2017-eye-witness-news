CAPE TOWN - Three learners have been arrested in connection with the fatal stabbing of a grade nine pupil at a Delft school. The 16-year-old was attacked on the school grounds of Leiden Secondary at around 11 am on Monday morning. The Western Cape Education Department says the grade 9 leaner was stabbed to death with a knife allegedly by a fellow pupil in the same grade. Education MEC’s spokesperson Jessica Shelver says the attack occurred during the first break. “Details around the incident are still sketchy but it is believed to be gang-related. The SAPS officials are on the scene and counselling will be provided as required.” Meanwhile, police have arrested a 17-year-old boy in connection with a stabbing at the Crystal High School in Hanover Park last week. About 10 to 12 alleged gang members stormed the school premises on Tuesday morning and stabbed a grade 11 girl in the back with a knife. She survived the attack.
