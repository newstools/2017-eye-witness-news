                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Gwede Mantashe says nominations for the party’s leadership are streaming in as the party prepares to head to its conference in December. A trend has emerged of several nomination lists being deliberated in branches where leaders belonging to various factions are included in a single list. A few months ago, several ANC provincial leaders met to try and agree on an uncontested leadership race at the party’s elective conference. While the leaders couldn’t agree on who should be the next president of the ANC, they did concede that leaders from different factions must feature on their respective lists. Mantashe says nominations are already coming in.  “They’re flooding in… not trickling in. When they come from nine provinces they can’t trickle, they can only flood in.” He says branches have up to 15 November to send their nominations, so the electoral commission can refine them by the end of November.
