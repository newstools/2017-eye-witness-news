                                         CAPE TOWN – At least 11 people have been arrested in an abalone bust in Cape Town. The City of Cape Town's marine unit - along with National Parks and Fisheries Department officials - were acting on a tip-off when they caught the suspects almost red-handed. Officials spotted them in the ocean.  The city's Wayne Dyason explains: “The divers exited the water and divers got into two vehicles. The vehicles were tracked and stopped in the Glencairn area, where all the occupants were arrested. A subsequent search of the bushes revealed another suspect who was arrested.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
