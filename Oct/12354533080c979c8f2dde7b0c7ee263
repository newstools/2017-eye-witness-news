                                         JOHANNESBURG - A British-based shipwreck hunter says a navigation tool he found that guided Portuguese explorers on a perilous voyage to India in the 16th century has been confirmed as the world's oldest astrolabe. David Mearns found the bronze disc during a dive on a shipwreck off the coast of Oman in 2014 but Warwick University has only recently confirmed what it is after laser scans revealed etches on it. It's dated between 1496 and 1500, around 30 years earlier than the previous oldest known astrolabe.
