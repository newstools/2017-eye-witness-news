                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliamentarians have been told that Trillian Capital Partners CEO Eric Wood knew in advance that Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene would be fired, and also had a hand in crafting a speech for Nene’s replacement, Des van Rooyen. This is according to former Trillian employee Mosilo Mothepu who has on Tuesday testified in a parliamentary inquiry into allegations of state capture at Eskom. Mothepu told the inquiry Wood also knew that Pravin Gordhan would be cut as finance minister. Incidentally, Gordhan is an African National Congress (ANC) member of the Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee probing the matter. Mothepu worked for Regiments Capital before it was bought by Eric Wood and Salim Essa and became Trillian Capital Partners. She has given the Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee a detailed account of how, in the absence of a business contract, Trillian got nearly R600 million from Eskom for advisory services. On 26 October 2015 her superior, Wood, told her that Nene would be axed, and several weeks later, it happened. “He emailed me a word document that essentially outlined the initiatives that the new minister was going to approve ..."  Mothepu says her former colleague, Mohamed Bobat, was appointed as Van Rooyen’s adviser. “Wood had appointed a PR company to write the new minister’s speeches.” She claims Bobat’s role was to channel work from state-owned companies to Regiments or Trillian. Mothepu has told MPs she’s aware of unconfirmed reports that Wood capitalised on his inside knowledge by purchasing foreign currency in November before Nene was fired, and then reversing the trade after Nene was axed, making a sizeable profit.
