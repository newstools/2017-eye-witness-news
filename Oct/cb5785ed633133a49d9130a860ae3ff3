                                         JOHANNESBURG - Midvaal Mayor Bongani Baloyi  says the municipality has already spent almost R1 million on protecting infrastructure along the R59 highway, which has been damaged by angry Sicelo residents. The community is demanding land and houses, which they claim Human Settlements MEC Paul Mashatile  promised them last year. Last week the mayor called in the Red Ants to restore calm to the area. A 32-year-old mentally ill man was beaten to death, allegedly by members of the security company. Baloyi says he hopes the Sicelo community will remain calm and no violence will erupt again. “So, at this stage, we can say there’s some calmness within the community going into this weekend. It depends on the contractor which is appointed by Gautrans which is our provincial department, how soon they are on the ground and how quickly they repair the road. There’s a very good chance if it all happens today, we may be able to open the road tomorrow.” Mashatile is expected to meet with the mayor next week to discuss time frames to address their concerns. The community has accused the MEC of making several promises for a year but failing to make good on this.
