                                         PRETORIA - The High Court has heard that the relief President Jacob Zuma is seeking in his State of Capture review cannot result in a constitutionally permissible solution because he cannot be the judge and jury his own case.  The Public Protector’s remedial action directed the president to establish a commission of inquiry led by a judge appointed by the Chief Justice.  But Zuma has argued that as the president, only he has the power to make such a decision and may not be dictated to by anyone.  Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi says that Zuma should implement what he has said he would do in Parliament.  “It’s quite clear that what he stated, there was an indication of his intention, not just an intention but a decision that he had already made to appoint the judicial commission of inquiry. He was talking about the inquiry as recommended by the Public Protector.”  But Congress of the People and United Democratic Movement’s lawyer Dali Mpofu says that Zuma cannot lawfully be allowed to establish a state capture commission of inquiry on terms and led by someone he has appointed.  “Whatever happens, the maxim you can’t be a judge in your own case is paramount.”  Zuma’s team has asked the court to refer the report back to the Public Protector.
