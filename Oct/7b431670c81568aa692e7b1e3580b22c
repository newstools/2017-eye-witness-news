                                         JOHANNESBURG – Police emergency call centres across the country are expected to be fully functional from Monday for the first time in four months with the end of a strike by almost 800 operators. The South African Police Union (Sapu) has agreed to go back to work although there is no wage settlement on the table yet. Last month, Sapu members refused to go back to work after Popcru signed an agreement with the police. Sapu president Mpho Kwinika says that union representatives and police management will now continue with wage talks while workers go back to answering calls from the public. Although workers have not succeeded in upgrading their salary from a level five to level seven, Kwinika says that they still view the strike as a success. “Not in the history of policing in this country, that police officials went on strike and nothing happened to them. So to us, this is a victory.” Police management has vowed to continue with internal disciplinary steps against those who participated in the strike. But Sapu says that if the police go ahead with hearings, it will turn to the courts.
