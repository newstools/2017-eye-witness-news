The defence’s first witness, Antonel Olckers, has been on the stand for a week. CAPE TOWN - The questioning of a DNA expert is expected to be finalised on Thursday in the trial of triple murder accused Henri van Breda. The defence’s first witness, Antonel Olckers, has been on the stand for a week. Olckers claims that over 40 DNA samples tested by State experts are invalid. Prosecutor Susan Galloway told the court that she would complete her cross-examination. The defence is then likely to call up either forensic pathologist Reggie Perumal or a neurosurgeon when court resumes on Monday. Galloway tested Olckers' testimony of a foreign substance that was found at the crime scene, which could be foreign DNA. Olckers said that although she couldn't identify the substance, police forensic analyst Sharlene Otto should've testified on it. But Galloway countered that Otto had told the court that she couldn't testify on the matter, because the lab was unable to determine whether it was a genetic component of DNA. Olckers was also unable to say for certain what effect this substance could have on the case. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
