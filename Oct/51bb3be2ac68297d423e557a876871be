                                         CAPE TOWN - Judge Frans Kgomo says he will be “scrupulously fair” when investigating alleged wrongdoing by the Hawks. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has appointed Kgomo as watchdog over the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, commonly known as the Hawks. The former judge president in the Northern Cape will now be responsible for probing complaints against the specialised crime-fighting unit. Although Kgomo is entering a contentious environment, he does not have any trepidation about the new job, saying he has faced challenging situations throughout his career. He says he will not delay any investigation that comes his way. “When it comes to performing my job, I have absolutely no trepidations. I have dealt with cases of dangerous criminals.” In the past, some people have questioned whether the Hawks unit is sufficiently independent of political influence. The Hawks and National Prosecuting Authority have come under fire recently for not moving on an investigation into allegations of corruption at the state-owned Passenger Rail Agency. Amid concerns that little is being done by the police to investigate allegations of state capture, Mbalula insists that's not the case. “It has never happened that he will put pressure on so-and-so must be arrested because he appears in some report of emails." Mbalula intends appointing the new head of the Hawks before the end of the year. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
