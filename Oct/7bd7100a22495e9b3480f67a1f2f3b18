                                         JOHANNESBURG â€“ Cosmetic company Dove has come under fire for an advert, which shows a black woman taking off her t-shirt to reveal a white woman underneath her skin. The company posted a series of pictures on Facebook as part of its advertising campaign for the product. The advert has sparked wide debate on social media with some accusing the brand of racism. Let's boycott the racist @Dove for their racist campaign. They disgusts me. Their products are for Black people. Clearly. #DoveMustFall pic.twitter.com/3h0KuoeJRO  Really @Dove Please respect us!!!#CountryDuty #DoveMustFall pic.twitter.com/B1fYru9h5m  Dove has since apologised and took down the advert on Facebook. The company says it missed the mark in thoughtfully representing women of colour and deeply regrets the offence that it has caused. An image we recently posted on Facebook missed the mark in representing women of color thoughtfully. We deeply regret the offense it caused.
