                                         JOHANNESBURG - Striking 10111 workers say they have exhausted all possible ways to have their demands addressed and believe it's time to involve the president. Workers affiliated to the South African Federation of Trade Unions have handed over a memorandum at the Union Buildings, demanding equal pay for call centre agents in line with other government departments. Workers have been protesting for over three months. While the no work no pay clause continues, the workers say they will not be distracted from achieving their goal. From July, the workers have been demanding that the police implement recommendations compiled by internal researchers, that their salaries be increased. On Monday, the South African Policing Union led workers in a march to the Union Buildings where they handed over a memorandum directed to President Jacob Zuma, urging him to intervene. They have also demanded that the president should instruct back payment from the day of the report which was in October last year. The protestors have given Zuma seven days to respond.
