                                         CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress Cape Town region has lodged a criminal complaint against Mayor Patricia de Lille. The party wants the police to investigate allegations that De Lille used public money to renovate her home in 2016-17. The Dullar Omar Region Chairperson Xolani Sotashe says they've lodged a complaint at the Central police station on Tuesday morning. “They were supposed to follow processes of the council. Failure to do that is tantamount to corruption.” He adds they have also approached the Public Protector on the matter. “Yes, we know that the office of the speaker is empowered to do the investigation within the administration. But we don’t trust that office now because the speaker has come out in defence of the mayor. I mean, he’s not going to be impartial.” De Lille has continuously denied the allegations saying she paid for the renovations apart from security upgrades which were prescribed by the police.
