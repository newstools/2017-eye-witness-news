                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (Sars) says it has noted the allegations against President Jacob Zuma  but cannot divulge details of any taxpayer's affairs. Jacques Pauw's new book The President's Keepers claims Zuma failed to submit his tax returns for at least the first five years of his Presidency. The Presidency has also rejected allegations that Zuma received R1 million a month from a security company without declaring it to Sars. The investigative journalist describes how President Zuma owes around R63 million in tax on the fringe benefits that accrued due to the 2009 Nkandla upgrades. The revenue service says it is bound by a confidentiality clause and cannot comment on any taxpayer's information in the public domain, not even the president's because itâ€™s against the law. Zuma's office, meanwhile, insists that his tax matters are in order, that he has declared all income received to the relevant authorities and has not received any information about taxes linked to the Nkandla upgrades.
