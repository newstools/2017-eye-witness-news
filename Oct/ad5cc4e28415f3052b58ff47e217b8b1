                                         MIDDLEBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga says the sentence in the coffin assault case  should serve as an example to the country, that racially motivated attacks have no place in a democracy. Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen were handed jail terms of 14 and 11 years respectively for forcing a black man into a coffin and threatening to set it alight last year. The crime was captured on video, sparking outrage around the country and making international headlines. The ANCâ€™s Speedy Mashilo says the case has cost the country its integrity in the fight against racism. He says the party welcomes the hefty sentences while the National Prosecuting Authority says the punishment fits the crime.
