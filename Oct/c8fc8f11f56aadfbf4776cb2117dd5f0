                                         CAPE TOWN – Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says African National Congress (ANC) leaders should be guided by OR Tambo's style of leadership. Ramphosa was invited by the ANC in the province to address their OR Tambo Centenary celebrations in Goodwood. He spoke highly of the former party president's integrity and leadership. “He was a person of integrity (and) a person of high morals.” #RamaphosaCPT Ramaphosa, we should take a mirror and look at ourselves...are we living by his values ? KB  Western Cape Provincial Secretary, Faiez Jacobs, says Saturday's event should reunite a fractured ANC. “Comrade Cyril, remind us of where we come from. We were a united ANC. We know an ANC that is close to our people, we know an ANC that is not corrupt.” The presidential candidate has been actively campaigning in the Western Cape ahead of the party's elective conference in December. Busses transporting party supporters from various regions in the province arrived at the Every Nation Christ Church in Goodwood. Inside the venue supporters, dressed in ANC paraphernalia, are chanting freedom songs as they take up their seats. Despite the OR Tambo commemoration, some supporters are also here to voice their backing of the Ramaphosa election campaign. One woman says, “I see him as the only hope for us as African National Congress members.” While a man at the event says, “He is the only candidate who can bring our people together.” Ramaphosa is also scheduled to go on walkabout in Khaylitsha following Saturday’s main event.
