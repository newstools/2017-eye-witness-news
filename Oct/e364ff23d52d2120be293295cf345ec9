The 29-year-old singer topped heat magazine's annual Rich List for the second year in a row after amassing a staggering a £132 million fortune. LONDON - Adele has topped heat magazine's annual list of the richest stars under 30, with a huge fortune of £132 million. The 29-year-old singer topped heat magazine's annual rich list for the second year in a row after amassing a staggering a staggering £132 million fortune, largely due to the £500,000-a-night she raked in at the 121 shows on her recent world tour. But the hitmaker - who has five-year-old son Angelo with husband Simon Konecki - isn't afraid to splash the cash, as she has spent over £20 million on homes in Los Angeles, London, Sussex and Hove. Adele's vast fortune put her £54 million ahead of the second-placed star, 28-year-old Daniel Radcliffe, with the Harry Potter actor's earnings listed as £78 million. He placed higher than his Harry Potter co-star, Emma Watson, 27, who was fifth with £48 million. Ed Sheeran, 26, with an estimated fortune of £52 million, took third place, having seen his earnings soar with the release of his third album Divide, and accompanying world tour. Fourth spot went to Sign of the Times singer Harry Styles, 23, with £56 million, earning more than his One Direction bandmates thanks to his solo record deal and new acting career. The rest of the group, Liam Payne, 24, Louis Tomlinson, 25, and Niall Horan, 24, tied for sixth place with £40 million, and former member Zayn Malik, 24, trailed behind them with slightly less of an estimated fortune, recorded as £37 million. Little Mix - Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall - shared the top 10 spot with a collective fortune of £28 million. This year's list saw a host of new entries further down, including places for Lion actor Dev Patel: TOWIE stars Sam Faiers, Joey Essex and Amy Childs: Big Brother host Rylan Clark-Neal; and Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner. Outside of the UK, Justin Bieber, 23, topped the global list with a huge £231 million, putting him ahead of 27-year-old Taylor Swift, who has an estimated fortune of £209 million. Commenting on the results, heat's Lucie Cave said: "Every year heralds huge surprises in heat's list of money makers and new entries in for 2017 show that reality TV can mean riches for some (hello Joey Essex, Sam Faiers and Rylan Clarke Neal!) but ultimately it's still old-fashioned singer-songwriters who make the most dosh. Adele, we bow down once more."
