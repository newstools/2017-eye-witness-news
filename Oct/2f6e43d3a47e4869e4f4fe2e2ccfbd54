                                         CAPE TOWN - Leah Tutu has used her birthday speech motivating South Africans to explore their individual talents.  Tutu celebrated her 84th birthday with husband Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille and other guests at the Granary Building in the Cape Town CBD on Saturday.  Final renovations are being done to the Buitenkant Street facility, that is soon set to house the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation’s Peace Centre. Tutu has expressed gratitude for the meaningful life that she is living. “We all have our special gift… there’s no one without a gift, God is not jealous in that way. He has given us something to work on and he gave me him to work on.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
