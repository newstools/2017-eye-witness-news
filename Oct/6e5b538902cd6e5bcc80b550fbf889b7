                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called on all government departments and entities to stop work with software company SAP following its admission to paying millions of rands to a Gupta-linked company. SAP paid R90 million between 2015 and 2016 to Gupta-owned CAD House in order to secure contracts with state-owned entities, including Eskom and Transnet. SAP is now reporting these accounts to US authorities for further investigation and taking action against three employees. The EFF says that the SAP must take things a step further and reveal the names of the people who facilitated the receipt of the bribe on the part of the Gupta-owned company. The EFF says that while the case is being investigated by United States authorities, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the South African authorities must also take action and called on the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to take the necessary steps. It says failure of the NPA to pursue the matter means that South African authorities have outsourced responsibilities of law and order to foreign nations. The party has blamed the African National Congress top leadership for the failure to prosecute the Guptas and President Jacob Zuma for the corruption in state-owned entities. At the same time, the Democratic Alliance says that the police have an obligation to investigate the matter.
