                                         CAPE TOWN - The Hawks say they have made a breakthrough in their investigation into a shooting at a popular Camps Bay restaurant. A suspect was arrested on Friday. Two people sustained gunshot wounds when armed men stormed Cafe Caprice in April firing several shots. The man made an appearance in the Cape Town Magistrates Court on Monday, where the case was postponed to next week. Hawks spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha said: “He was facing two counts of attempted murder after two victims were shot and wounded when he allegedly randomly opened fire at the patrons. The matter has been postponed to 9 October for a bail application.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
