                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says the president’s second term has reversed the gains the party made in his first term and he’s described Jacob Zuma’s current period as “not good at all.” Mantashe was speaking on Radio 702 earlier on Tuesday. Mantashe was asked if he regrets the presidency of Jacob Zuma. “The first term of Jacob Zuma, he did well, restructured education results are there for everybody to read. Look into the health system.” But the president’s second term has been riddled with a number of controversies, from disastrous Cabinet reshuffles, to Nkandla, state capture and several other scandals. Mantashe says this second term has not been good. “The second one was not good at all, not good at all. Many things have happened during the second term that have mitigated the good work we did in the first term.” Mantashe says he is worried that another mistake similar to the one in Polokwane when then-president Thabo Mbeki was recalled to make way for Zuma, might happen this year when the party chooses its new leadership.
