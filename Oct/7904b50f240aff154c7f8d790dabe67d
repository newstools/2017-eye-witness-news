                                         DURBAN - The Moerane Commission of Inquiry  investigating political killings in KwaZulu-Natal has heard how an African National Congress (ANC) member was murdered for raising concerns around corruption in her municipality. Khanyisile Ngobese-Sibisi  was shot several times with an assault rifle while on her way to Mandela Day celebrations in Ladysmith last year. She was a candidate to become an ANC councillor ahead of the 2016 local government elections. Fanyana Jele told the commissioners that his sister confided in the family that there was an imminent threat on her life. But he says she insisted on standing for the position to become councillor in Ward 20 in the Ukhahlamba region. Ngobese-Sibisi is believed to have been outspoken about alleged corruption in a housing project that was commissioned by the Ladysmith Municipality. Tuesday’s testimony echoes that of former ANC Youth League secretary Sinidiso Magaqa’s friends, who have told commissioners he was earmarked to become a councillor in the Harry Gwala Region where five ANC councillors have been murdered in the last few months.
