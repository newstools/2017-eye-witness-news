                                         CAPE TOWN – Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has promised Philippi residents officials are committed to efforts to drastically reduce crime. Specialised South African Police Service units are busy conducting raids in the area, following the past weekend's shootings that claimed the lives of 11 people. Forty-five suspects  have so far been arrested. Provincial police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula says they are hard at work to address shortcomings at the local police station. “This station is only short of six vehicles, so we’re going to be deploying more vehicles in this area.” Mbalula says complaints have been received about the former station commander's efficiency. “He has not been performing to the levels of which we want, so that’s why there has been an immediate intervention because we want change. “Our police stations must respond. And where some of the people are a liability to what we’re doing, they have got to be shifted and we get our fast and furious wheels to be in the forefront.” Forty additional police officers will be also deployed to the station. BIG LESSONS Jula reassured Philippi residents that this past weekend’s mass shooting will never be repeated. The provincial Police Commissioner said officials are hard at work investigating the killings. “The members of your families have not died in vain, but there are lessons that we have to learn from what has happened that must help us to ensure that such sad and tragic incidents do not happen ever again in this area” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
