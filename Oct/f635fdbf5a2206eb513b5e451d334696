                                         JOHANNESBURG – The South African Policing Union (Sapu) has called off their 10111 strike and will be back at work on Monday for the first time since July. The union, which represents over 700 striking employees, has written to the employer to notify them of the decision agreed upon by workers on Thursday night. The Labour Court on Thursday dismissed Sapu’s urgent application to rule whether the strike is protected. Police management says it is continuing with instituting disciplinary process against those who went on strike. But Sapu’s president, Mpho Kwinika, says that they will take them to court if they proceed. “There’s nothing that’s going to happen to those employees. If they’re sure of what they’re doing, let them go ahead. They will never succeed. We’ll take them to court.” Meanwhile, pilots at low-cost airline Mango have now also called off their strike after four days, settling on a 7% salary increase. Trade union Solidarity’s Deon Reyneke says that workers are already back at work on Friday morning. “They’re already on standby as from last night. The strike is called off.”
