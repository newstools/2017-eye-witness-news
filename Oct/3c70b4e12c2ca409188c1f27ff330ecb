                                         CAPE TOWN - The Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry says that the City of Cape Town has a massive challenge in trying to take over management of the rail network. The municipality was last week given the green light by the city council to help Metrorail manage the embattled system. Cape Chamber president, Janine Myburgh, believes that the city does not yet have the skills in place to manage the rail system. But she says the city had no option but to step in because it's been clear that Metrorail is not winning and that the service is declining. Myburgh adds that the first step should be to stop ongoing vandalism and copper theft. The city hopes to take control of the rail network, which has become synonymous with poor service and growing commuter distrust. Even though council has on Thursday approved an initial plan, it could still take up to three years to complete a comprehensive business plan to take over from Metrorail.
