                                         JOHANNESBURG – A public meeting is expected to be held today for all scholar patrolmen in Gauteng following a string of sexual assault cases at various schools. A school guard was arrested over a week ago for allegedly molesting at least 87 girls at a primary school in Soweto since then more cases have come to light. The Gauteng Education Department is currently investigating five schools in the province with most of the crimes implicating scholar patrolmen. The Community Safety and Education Departments have called the urgent meeting where a re-vetting of scholar patrolmen will begin later today. MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane says, “We’ve got about 6,000 patrollers that are registered in our database. On Sunday, we’re calling all of them to attend a public meeting where they will be addressed by both myself and MEC Lesufi.” Last week, Gauteng Premier David Makhura appointed a special committee to tackle safety at schools. Makhura also instructed all station commanders to work with schools in order to stop the abuse of children in the schooling environment.
