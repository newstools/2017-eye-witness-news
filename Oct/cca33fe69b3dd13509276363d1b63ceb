                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former President Thabo Mbeki says the leadership of Oliver Tambo is needed to save the African National Congress (ANC) from completely self-destructing. Mbeki delivered the keynote address at the OR Tambo lecture at Wits University on Friday, where he was welcomed by the Tambo family and other stalwarts. He says for the ANC to self-correct, leaders and members must first genuinely accept the challenges the party faces. Mbeki says the ANC is need of true leadership. “They should live up to the example he has set by always being loyal to truth, by always being loyal to the principles and the historic purposes of the ANC and defeating those holding the ANC hostage.” Mbeki says those being corrupt and greedy are often card-carrying ANC members. The former president adds OR Tambo’s values must be embodied by those in power to truly honour his memory. Friday marked the 100th birthday of the late ANC leader. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
