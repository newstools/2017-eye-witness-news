                                         JOHANNESBURG - Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga says he will not recognise a win by President Uhuru Kenyatta in Thursdayâ€™s scheduled election re-run as a political crisis gripping the east African country shows no sign of ending. Odinga pulled out of the race earlier this month, claiming opposition demands to overhaul the country's election body had not been met. Kenya is holding the election re-run after the country's Supreme Court annulled the results of an August poll, following a challenge by Odinga, due to "irregularities" in the electoral process. Kenyatta had been declared the winner of that vote. Meanwhile, the United Nations and the African Union are appealing for peace as tensions build in the country. The call for calm comes amid allegations by opposition leader Odinga that the election, a re-run of an August vote that was nullified by the Supreme Court, will not be free and fair. Kenyatta wants to push ahead with this week's vote even though the election commission head says he cannot guarantee its credibility.
