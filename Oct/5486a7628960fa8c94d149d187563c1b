                                         CAPE TOWN - Lawmakers have heard their inquiry into state-owned enterprises is arguably the most important in the country’s parliamentary history. The Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises has on Tuesday kicked off its inquiry into Eskom with a presentation from University of Cape Town Professor Anton Eberhard who has authored a booklet about instances of governance failure and state capture at the parastatal. It follows revelations in leaked emails of influence peddling by the Gupta family to score lucrative state contracts. Eberhard has set the scene for the probe into state capture. He told the committee that oversight structures have been weakened over the years through a series of Cabinet reshuffles and appointments to the board and senior management of Eskom. “The fact that we’ve had six CEOs in 3.5 years under Minister [Lynne] Brown is unprecedented, we’ve never had that... you can understand how enormously disruptive this is.” With governance structures repurposed to serve narrow interests, Eberhard explained that blatant acts of corruption appear to have been perpetrated through the awarding of coal contracts. MPs are keeping the witness list under wraps for security reasons, so it remains unclear who will be called to give evidence when the inquiry continues on Wednesday. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
