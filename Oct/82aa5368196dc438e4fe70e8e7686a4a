                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has postponed its disciplinary hearing into suspended executive Matshela Koko until a new evidence leader is appointed. The power utility announced today it's fired its lawyer Sebetja Matsaung following an altercation with a journalist. Matsaung lost his temper and threatened to assault the Financial Mail's Sikonathi Mantshantsha for his reporting on the alleged corruption at Eskom, after proceedings into the hearing were adjourned yesterday. Spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said, “The hearing which was supposed to happen on Monday will not happen, this will give Eskom enough time to look for a replacement.”  (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
