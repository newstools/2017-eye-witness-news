                                         CAPE TOWN – Students campaigning for free education at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology have rejected what appears to be a leaked version of the fees commission report. According to the City Press, the commission's report says universal free higher education will not be feasible in the foreseeable future. But Lukhanyo Vanqa, who represents the Pan Africanist Student Movement of Azania (Pasma), says President Jacob Zuma must be the one to release the report, not the media. “We understand that the leaking of that report could only have emanated from the presidency and the reason for that leaking is to create a soft landing for when the president announces that there won’t be any free education in this upcoming week. He wants it not to be a shock when it comes out.”
