                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling on Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance to schedule hearings so that Members of Parliament (MPs) can scrutinise South African Revenue Services' handling of the so-called "rogue unit" controversy. But the committee's chairperson, Yunus Carrim,  says they don't have the technical capacity nor the mandate to launch a full-scale inquiry. Carrim says the issue fell within the scope of Parliament's intelligence committee. KPMG International recently withdrew the findings of a 2015 report that was compiled by its South African division into the activities of a covert intelligence unit at the revenue service. But SARS boss Tom Moyane  insists the KPMG report is not flawed. He has since complained to Parliament's finance committee about the auditing firm's conduct. Carrim says he has responded to Moyane. “He said that we don’t have the capacity to investigate, the [Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors] has. And moreover, in the matter of the rogue intelligence unit, that has been investigated already by the intelligence committee.” Carrim says any investigation involving KPMG should be handled by the regulatory body. “The law provides for the IRBA to investigate, that is why it’s there.” The IRBA will appear before the committee on Tuesday to give feedback on some of its ongoing investigations.
