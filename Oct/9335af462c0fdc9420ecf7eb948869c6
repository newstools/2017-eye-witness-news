                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Presidency says there’s nothing suspicious about its meeting with senior editors from the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). The Presidency has denied allegations that President Jacob Zuma summoned SABC news staff to his office as suggested by the Democratic Alliance (DA)’s shadow minister of communications Phumzile van Damme. The president’s spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga says he did meet with two senior news editors from the broadcaster as a courtesy call. Van Damme has accused the timing of the meeting between the president’s spokesperson with the two SABC journalists as suspicious considering the broadcaster remains without a board. But the Presidency says it understands the urgency at the SABC as the broadcaster continues to face many challenges. Ngqulunga said: “The public broadcaster spoke quite clearly about the requirements for someone to serve on the board of the SABC... for instance, their knowledge of the broadcasting space.” Ngqulunga says he meets with journalists all the time and it’s quite clear Van Damme got it wrong.
