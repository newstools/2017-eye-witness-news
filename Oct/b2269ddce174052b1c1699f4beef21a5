                                         CAPE TOWN – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says now is the time for his party to work harder in a bid to oust the African National Congress (ANC). Maimane was the keynote speaker at his party's Western Cape election congress held in Goodwood outside the Mother City on Saturday. Provincial Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela has been elected as the party's provincial leader. Maimane says his party must lead by example.  Loud cheers emanated in the venue when Maimane reiterated the party's calls for complete change and a new beginning for South Africa. Maimane warns there's no place for complacency within the DA as the party works towards the 2019 elections. “It’s time for us to be really focused on the quality of life of South Africans. We will not rest until their lives have changed.” He adds this isn't the time for the party to lose focus and he is encouraging all DA party members to respect and put voters first, as they are the “true bosses”.
