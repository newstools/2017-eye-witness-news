                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it won't back down from attempts to get Parliament to review Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's fitness to hold office. Last week the justice committee backtracked on a decision to hold an inquiry, saying there was no need or basis for one. Mkhwebane has since announced that she intends suing two DA members of that committee for allegedly calling her a spy. But DA whip John Steenhuisen says the party is undeterred. The DA believes recent court challenges support its view that Mkhwebane is not fit to hold office. Steenhuisen says he will be writing to Speaker Baleka Mbete this week to challenge the justice committee's decision not to probe Mkhwebane's conduct. “They decided not to conduct an inquiry into her fitness to hold office without even affording me the opportunity to appear before them and argue my case. Now I would say that’s perfect grounds for irrationality and unreasonableness.” He says if the matter is not reconsidered by Parliament, they may be forced to take legal action.
