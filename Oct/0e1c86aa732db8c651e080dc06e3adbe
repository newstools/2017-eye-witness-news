                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA) has launched an ad campaign that may ruffle a few feathers. In its latest video ad, the agency depicts ordinary citizens consulting mediums for supernatural intervention in an attempt to erase their traffic fines, a clear stab at the "miracles" promised by some prophets who have found themselves under the spotlight of the Commission for Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities – such as the "Prophet of Doom".  RTIA Chief Executive Officer Japh Chuwe says he was grabbed by the satirical approach which he welcomed as "an icebreaker". “I am aware of the recent tensions around bogus prophets who have been accused of taking advantage of vulnerable people,” says Chuwe”. He says while he acknowledges that the issue of false prophets is a serious one, he hopes South Africans will be able to use the ad to laugh at themselves. Senior Manager of media and marketing at the agency, Monde Mkalipi, says the agency took all precautions to mix education with entertainment, without offending anyone. The advert is currently on air in various media outlets.
