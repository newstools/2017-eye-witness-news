                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa says that he will continue to serve the country and its people even if he is fired by President Jacob Zuma. Answering questions in the National Assembly just two days after Zuma’s latest Cabinet shake-up, Ramaphosa addressed rumours that he could be next in line for the chop, saying that he serves at the pleasure of the president. Ramaphosa’s ousting would open the way for his chief rival in the race for the African National Congress (ANC) presidency, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to take his place, and possibly offer a safe landing for Zuma should he opt for an early exit. Rampahosa confidant and co-founder of the National Union of Mineworkers, James Matlatsi, has suggested that Ramaphosa could be axed on the basis of a dodgy intelligence report. Ramaphosa referred questions to the man in charge, at whose pleasure he serves. "You should pose that question to the president, who does all these firings and all these appointments himself." Then came a comment on the wisdom of rapid-fire reshuffles of ministers - from one portfolio to another, after being in charge for a mere few months – while the country is on the brink of a further ratings downgrade. "We must admit that this has added to the narrative of instability." Ramaphosa spoke out against "rampant" corruption in state-owned entities, but was momentarily floored when ANC MP Zukiswa Rantho asked why he hadn’t acted earlier to help stop the rot. "These incidents of corruption are only now spewing out in the manner that all of us have become aware of," Ramaphosa said. Skeptical MPs weren’t impressed.
