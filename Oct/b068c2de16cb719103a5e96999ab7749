She’s previously been identified as a possible deputy candidate for Ramaphosa. Sisulu was asked by one of the students who she intends including on her slate at the party's elective conference in December. She says she and campaign managers haven't decided yet, but one slot is already occupied. “There is one slot that’s already been covered. That is by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa.” She says it's time for women to lead. The minister has promised the students that she’ll ensure young people are included in her team. #Sisulu17 Lindiwe Sisulu has arrived.
