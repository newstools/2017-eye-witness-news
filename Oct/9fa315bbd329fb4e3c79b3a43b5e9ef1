                                         CAPE TOWN - A sub-committee hearing investigating a feud between Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and one of her mayoral committee members is set to start on Tuesday. De Lille and her head of safety and security JP Smith have been placed on 'special leave'  while this investigation is underway. Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane met with the pair on Monday night following a heated public exchange between them. The DA's federal executive has set up a special sub-committee to investigate the strained relationship between the two. The party's chief whip John Steenhuisen will be chairing the committee. In a statement released earlier, the DA explains de Lille and Smith will be unable to attend party caucus meetings or interact with caucus members. It doesn't affect their candidacy for provincial elected positions, nor does it affect their work in government. They've also been instructed not to speak to the media. Last night, de Lille issued a statement saying she sought legal advice regarding Smith and some Internal Investigations Unit members who've been making malicious and defamatory remarks against her.
