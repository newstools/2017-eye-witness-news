                                         CAPE TOWN - A 17-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the attempted robbery of an SBV cash truck in Khayelitsha.  The vehicle apparently pulled up at Nolungile Railway Station to collect cash, when about five armed men opened fire on security guards when they returned to the vehicle yesterday.  The guards then fired back at the suspects. The injured suspect was later found lying on the ground at a nearby taxi rank, with a loaded handgun close to him.  He was taken to a local hospital and is under police guard.  The Hawks' Lloyd Ramovha says if he is not fit enough, he’ll appear in absentia for the court’s records. “The remaining suspects are still at large but the Hawks are closing in on them. The teenager will appear in court on Monday.”
