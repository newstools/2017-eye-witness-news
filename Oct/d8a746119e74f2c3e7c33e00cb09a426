                                         KABUL - Police seized a truck loaded with more than 2,500kg of explosives as its driver tried to enter the Afghan capital on Saturday night, officials said. Police manning a checkpoint attempted to stop a truck entering the city on Saturday night, only to have the driver try to escape, said Kabul police chief Salem Asas. “Afghan National Police had prior information that a vehicle carrying explosives would enter the city,” he told reporters. “They ordered the driver to stop but he tried to escape and crashed.” Hidden under tomatoes in the truck were thousands of kilograms of explosives, including ammonium nitrate as well as several military-grade bombs, Asas said. Fears of another large attack have lingered after a massive truck bomb struck downtown Kabul in May, killing more than 150 people. In many sections of the city, crews have erected barriers to prevent large trucks from entering certain roads, and officials are planning additional security measures around government ministries and international diplomatic and military compounds.
