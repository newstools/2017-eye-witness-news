                                         CAPE TOWN – Helicopters are water bombing a wildfire that's been raging on the slopes above Cape Town's Victoria Road for almost two days. On Thursday night, the Twelve Apostles Hotel and Spa had to be evacuated when the flames moved down. Firefighters managed to stop the fire from encroaching upon the hotel. Only staff at the Twelve Apostles Hotel have been allowed back while guests have been moved to different locations. Several fire engines are stationed outside the entrance of the hotel. Firefighting crews who’ve been working through the night are waiting for relief from fresh teams. Firefighters say it’s unlikely that the fire will die down anytime soon, as it’s expected to get hotter, and there’s the risk of the wind picking up. Crews aren’t able to access the fire about fifty meters away from the hotel, so aerial support is needed to water bomb the area.
