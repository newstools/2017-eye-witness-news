                                         PARLIAMENT - The African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) who has been a driving force behind a parliamentary inquiry into Eskom has been replaced as chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises. As acting chair, Zukiswa Rantho led the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises to secure resources and an experienced evidence leader for the probe. It’s the only one of the four committees tasked with investigating state capture to have made tangible progress. Lawmakers were quizzing officials from the Eskom Pension and Provident Fund about a controversial pension payout to the utility’s former CEO Brian Molefe when the ANC Chief Whip’s office announced a caucus reshuffle. It included replacing Rantho with National Executive Committee Member Lungi Mnganga-Gcabashe. Rantho appeared surprised by the news. “Doing a good job doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed a position. I’m doing the job for South Africans and not for me.” Rantho later announced that the inquiry will not be sitting next week to allow the committee time to catch up on other business. Mnganga-Gcabashe is likely to be formally elected as chairperson at the committee’s next meeting. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
