                                         PRETORIA - Ipid head Robert McBride has made a brief appearance in the Pretoria Magistrates Court where he's facing charges of assault for allegedly attacking his daughter.  McBride was released R10,000 bail in August.  His teenage daughter claims that he beat her and tried to strangle her. He's denied the allegation, but says he admonished her. McBride’s legal team asked the court to instruct the prosecutors to have the case ready to go to trial when the matter resumes.  The magistrate found that the request was premature and granted the prosecutor another postponement for further investigation.  The case will be heard again on 24 October.  It emerged last month that McBride’s daughter had obtained a protection order against him. He says he wants the trial to proceed as soon as possible so he can clear his name.
