                                         CAPE TOWN â€“ South African Rugby President Mark Alexander on Monday expressed his condolences to the family and friends of Dr Cecil Moss, who passed away on Friday at the age of 92. Moss is a former Springbok wing and was the oldest living Springbok until his death. Moss played four Tests at wing for South Africa against the All Blacks in 1949, a series the Springboks won 4-0 on home soil. He later became the head coach of the national team and led them to nine victories in 10 tests in the 80s. Educated at SACS and at the University of Cape Town, he qualified as a medical doctor and was part of the team involved in the first heart transplant in 1967. Alexander has acknowledged the impact that Moss made on South African rugby, saying as a coach and selector not many could come close to him. His exploits as doctor off the field were also recognised by Alexander. Dr Moss is survived by his wife of 67 years, Jill, their son Jaime, their daughter Tessa and grandchildren.
