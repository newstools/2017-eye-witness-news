                                         JOHANNESBURG - Teaching has been disrupted at a Protea Glen school because mobile toilets have been removed. Parents and pupils have been protesting at Tholimfundo Primary, demanding action from the government. The school governing body (SGB) says the toilets were taken away on Sunday because the contract between the service provider and the department had come to an end. SGB member Rejoice Ramfate said: “Today the parents and the SGB decided that they need to protest because since Monday, no official from the Department of Education or the district has come to our school to hear that our kids have almost three days without toilets.” The department has not yet commented.
