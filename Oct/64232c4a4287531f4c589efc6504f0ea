                                         JOHANNESBURG – Motorists have been warned that the latest fuel price is the first of many over the next while. Fuel prices went up at midnight with motorists now paying between 25 and 29 cents more for a litre of petrol, while diesel costs 42 cents more. The Agricultural Business Chamber says the increase is the highest since 2014. Economist Wandile Sihlobo said: “Going forward, it only depends on how the Brent crude oil price is going to trade as well as the currency. “But looking at how things are globally, I think we might be at this level for quite some time because you look at the Brent crude oil price is still trading above $50 per barrel.”
