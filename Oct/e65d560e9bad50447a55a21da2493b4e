                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has been accused of improperly awarding tenders worth over R1 million to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown’s alleged longtime lover and close associate. The Sunday Times is reporting that Ingrid Tufvesson's eSmart Solutions scored lucrative oil tenders from Eskom despite having no expertise in the field. The newspaper claims Tufvesson and Brown's former personal assistant's mother Michelle McMaster received two tenders worth R1.2 million from Eskom this year alone. It’s reported suspended Eskom CEO Matshela Koko awarded the tenders to eSmart Solutions in exchange for favours with the minister. Meanwhile, the disciplinary hearing into Koko's alleged corrupt dealings at the power utility is set to get underway on Monday.
