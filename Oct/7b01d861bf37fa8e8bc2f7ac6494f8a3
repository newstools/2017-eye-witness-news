                                         CAPE TOWN - A man has been sentenced to an effective six years in prison on counts of fraud, forgery and money laundering. Bigboy Ndlovu was sentenced in the Bellville Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday. Ndlovu approached different Capitec bank branches to open bank accounts with fraudulent identity and proof of residence documents. He has been convicted of identity fraud, forgery and money laundering. The court also declared him unfit to possess a firearm. Ndlovu applied for loans from Capitec Bank and his modus operandi included falsifying documents and stealing the identities of unsuspecting people to open these accounts. Other supporting documents were also forged. He then withdrew the money after it was paid into the various bank accounts. Capitec Bank suffered a loss amounting to almost R55,500. Ndlovu was directly linked to the crimes via his fingerprints that were stored on Capitec's biometric system.
