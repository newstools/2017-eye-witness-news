                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media & Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) has sent an open letter to the SABC warning its members will go on strike if its demand for management reform is not met in the next week. Bemawu is calling for the suspension of several managers, who it says were responsible for the axing of the so-called SABC 8.  The union is also calling for a full investigation into the controversial policy on banning protest footage. Spokesperson Hannes Du Buisson said: “Some of those demands are the immediate appointment of the board and then the suspension of certain of the people involved as enforcers in the protest policy who are management at the SABC and those people still being in positions.”
