                                         DURBAN – Top African National Congress (ANC) officials are expected to meet with the so-called rebels who took the KwaZulu-Natal ANC to court on Monday morning to discuss divisions in the province. On Sunday, the national leadership met with the provincial executive committee which has been declared to have been elected unlawfully by the Pietermaritzburg High Court. The ANC’s senior leaders are in KwaZulu-Natal to foster unity between the two factions ahead of the elective conference this December. It’s understood some members of the ANC’s top six, including President Jacob Zuma, will be locked in a meeting with the so-called ANC rebels to discuss a way forward with the party divided on whether to disband the KwaZulu-Natal collective. Last week, the nullified KZN leadership filed an application for leave to appeal the High Court judgment without the NEC’s approval. Weekend reports say Zuma gave his blessing to the provincial leadership to appeal while there is also a proposal for an inclusive task team ahead of the elective conference. At the same time, the rebels have expressed disappointment at the latest court action, saying it’s a desperate attempt by the nullified collective to cling onto power.
