                                         CAPE TOWN - The Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) has assured lawmakers that it will fast-track a probe into KPMG’s audit of the Gupta-owned Linkway Trading. The regulator is focusing on KPMG’s role in auditing a Gupta-owned project management company allegedly involved in diverting public funds from the Free State provincial government to pay for a lavish Gupta family wedding at Sun City in 2013. The auditing firm, which cut ties with the Guptas last year, has denied that it was involved with or condoned money laundering activities. In June, the state-funded IRBA announced it was investigating KPMG’s audit of Linkway Trading. Although investigations can take up to 18 months to complete, the regulatory body’s chief executive Bernard Agulhas told Parliament’s Finance Committee on Tuesday that they’re hoping to finalise the KPMG probe sooner. "The board instructed that we have to fast-track this particular investigation, and I'm talking about KPMG." But what about KPMG’s other big problem, its controversial report on a so-called rogue unit at South African Revenue Services (Sars)? Democratic Alliance Member of Parliament David Maynier asked Agulhas if they’re looking at that matter. "And I want to be clear, does the scope of your investigation extend to the controversy surrounding the forensic report into the so-called Sars rogue unit?" Agulhas responded that their investigation will likely broaden to include the Sars issue.
