                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma will meet former Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande for the first time on Thursday since his axing, as the African National Congress (ANC) meets with its alliance partners the SACP, Cosatu and Sanco.  ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has told Eyewitness News the political alliance council meeting has been confirmed for Thursday. This crucial meeting between alliance partners was meant to take place earlier this year but it was postponed by the ANC because the governing party wanted the SACP and Cosatu to clarify their statements around the president. The national officials of the organisations will not only meet for the first time since Cosatu and the SACP called on the president to step down but also since the president fired the communist party's general secretery Blade Nzimande. Last week, Mantashe was concerned that Nzimande’s axing would jeopardise the meeting. But as speculation amongst the alliance partners increases that President Zuma may decide not to attend the meeting, Mantashe told Eyewitness News it’s all systems go for tomorrow.
