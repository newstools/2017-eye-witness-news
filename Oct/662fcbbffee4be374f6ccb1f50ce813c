                                         PRETORIA - The Public Protector has announced it will sue Democratic Alliance (DA) members Glynnis Breytenbach and Werner Horn for defamation after the pair claimed she was a State Security Agency spy.  The pair made the comments in September last year before Advocate Busisiwe Mkwebane was appointed to the position.  Breytenbach and Horn accused Advocate Mkwebane of being on the State Security Agency’s payroll while she was employed by the Home Affairs Department and deployed to China.  Mkhwebane says these claims are false and defamatory. The Public Protector’s office says it will approach the courts to compel the pair to retract the statements and issue an apology, adding that Mkhwebane reserves the right to also claim for damages.  These DA parliamentarians aren’t the only politicians to have accused the Public Protector of being a spook. In June, Economic Freedom Fighters’ leader Julius Malema said when referring to Mkhwebane: “Once a spy always a spy”.  (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
