                                         PRETORIA – While the Supreme Court of Appeal is expected to confirm that the decision to withdraw the 783 criminal charges against President Jacob Zuma was, in fact, irrational, the real question is how the court will guide the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on the way forward. Judgement in the eight-year-long court battle will be handed down in Bloemfontein on Friday. The High Court in Pretoria ruled earlier this year that the 2009 decision to withdraw charges was irrational and set it aside which had the automatic effect of the charges being reinstated against the president. If the SCA fully re-affirms the High Court ruling, it would just be a matter for the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to serve a fresh indictment on Zuma and summons him to court. But the NPA indicated that it wanted prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams to have another bite of the cherry and decide afresh if Zuma should be charged. However, the president’s legal team argued that they should be entitled to make fresh representations to the NPA. Whichever way the court rules, it is widely expected that Zuma will simply adopt a new tactic to further delay his day in court. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
