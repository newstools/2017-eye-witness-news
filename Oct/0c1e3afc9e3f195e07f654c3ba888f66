                                         JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Johannesburg has dismissed the Black First Land First (BLF)'s application to appeal a contempt order with costs. The group’s leader, Andile Mngxitama, was found to be in contempt of court in July after he disrupted a media event - in contravention of an interdict that barred him from intimidating journalists. The BLF had released the names of reporters and editors, which it accused of supporting white monopoly capital and threatened to protest at their homes and places of worship. The South African National Editors Forum’s Mahlatse Mahlase says they are pleased with the court's ruling. “We believe that this is again the court affirming the rule of law and meaning that the earlier judgment stands that BLF is interdicted from harassing, threatening or even going to journalists’ homes.”
