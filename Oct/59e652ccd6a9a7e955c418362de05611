According to his office, the President has to consult with some of his cabinet ministers to ensure the government is ready to implement the president's decision. At the same time, while speaking at the OR Tambo centenary celebration event in Goodwood, in the Western Cape, Deputy President, Cyril Ramaphosa, has called on university students to be patient as the government is dealing with their tertiary education funding problems. Ramaphosa told the crowd gathered at the Every Nation Christ Church that government is exploring ways to make free, quality tertiary education a reality. "We are still waiting for the report to be released and for government to determine precisely how it is going address what has been recommended by the commission.” Yesterday, Wits University's SRC called for a national day of action and says it stands in solidarity with universities that have already embarked on a shutdown. Hundreds of students from the University of Cape Town (UCT) and Cape Peninsula University Of Technology marched to Parliament on Wednesday, demanding the release of the report. There have been similar protests at the University of the Free State where violent confrontations have played out over the past week.
