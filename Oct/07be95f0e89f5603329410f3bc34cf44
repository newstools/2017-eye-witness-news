                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape trade and tourism promotion agency Wesgro  says it's re-evaluating its relationship with embattled auditing firm KPMG. This came to light at the agency's annual review in Cape Town on Tuesday. The company has been successful in securing billions of rands worth of investments for the province in the 2016-17 financial year, despite the difficult economic conditions. KPMG  is the internal auditing firm for Wesgro. The agency is technically a state-owned enterprise operating at the behest of the provincial government and the City of Cape Town. Wesgro chairman Brian Figaji said: “We asked our audit committee to discuss among themselves the whole KPMG debacle, they had an interaction with KPMG and presented us a report and we had a special board meeting yesterday.” He adds an announcement on the relationship between Wesgro and KPMG will be made in the next few days. The auditor responded to allegations that it assisted the Gupta-family in siphoning money for a family wedding by cleaning out some of their South African management, but this did little to stop some of its big clients jumping ship.
