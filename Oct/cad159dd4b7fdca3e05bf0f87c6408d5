                                         ZIMBABWE - The Zimbabwean government says it respects a decision by the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to rescind President Robert Mugabe's appointment as a goodwill ambassador. Mugabe was to be an ambassador against non-communicable diseases in Africa, but critics pointed to the poor state of his own country's public health system. Foreign Affairs Minister Walter Mzembi says it's WHO that will be the biggest loser in this decision. In comments carried by the state ZBC, the minister said Mugabe was more focused on saving lives than on being a global ambassador. WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the announcement that he was cancelling Mugabe's appointment early on Sunday afternoon. In a statement on Twitter, he said he'd spoken to the government of Zimbabwe and concluded that this decision was in the best interests of WHO. University of Zimbabwe law lecturer Fadzayi Mahere says the cancellation of the appointment is good news, while rights lawyer Doug Coltart says it shows the power Zimbabweans have when they speak out.
