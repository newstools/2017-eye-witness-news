                                         JOHANNESBURG – Students at the Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth are demanding management increase security on campus in the wake of the recent attack on two female students. A student was allegedly raped while another was stabbed this week when a man gained entry into one of the institution’s computer labs. The crime sparked student protests on Tuesday, demanding the university address their security concerns.  Students at the university say the latest crime on campus has highlighted the urgent need for management to act swiftly and address their safety concerns. Student Representative Council member Nobubele Phuza said: “We’re at a point now where it’s critical and our bodies are actually on the line and we’re hoping that management will respond with immediate effect.” Phuza says she fears the incident may happen again. “Because today it was these two students, tomorrow it can be anyone else.” Meanwhile, the university’s management has committed to improving security on its campuses after a meeting with students on Tuesday.
