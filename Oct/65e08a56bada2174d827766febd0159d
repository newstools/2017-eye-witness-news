                                         PRETORIA - Duduzane Zuma’s attorney says that if his client is privately prosecuted by Gerrie Nel, they will go to court as required and strongly oppose the case. Nel, who heads AfriForum’s private prosecution unit, announced on Tuesday that he intends pursuing a case of culpable homicide against Zuma for the 2014 death of a taxi commuter. An inquest found that the president's son was responsible for the collision which killed Pumzile Dube but the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) declined to prosecute. Nel first needs a certificate from the NPA confirming that it has declined to prosecute Zuma before he can initiate the case. Zuma’s attorney Gary Mazaham says he doesn’t foresee the NPA declining to issue the required certificate because they’ve already indicated they don’t intend to prosecute his client. “If they are going ot prosecute and the certificate is granted, we will obviously have little choice than to answer to the charge that is brought. We will do so to the fullest.” Once received, Nel has three months to institute proceedings. The NPA says once Nel’s application is received, it will be considered by the director of public prosecutions and his decision made public. LISTEN: AfriForum announces first private prosecution case
