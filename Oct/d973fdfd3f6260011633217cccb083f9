                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng has nominated deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa as its prefered candidate for party president ahead of the party's December elective conference. It is understood that Ramaphosa was approved by the provincial executive committee as the only candidate for nomination as president. Ramaphosa has so far also received the endorsement from the Northern Cape and Eastern Cape. The ANC leadership in Gauteng says it decided to back Ramaphosa because he can unite the organisation. The party's provincial leaders have sent a letter to its branches guiding them on who to nominate. The Gauteng ANC general assembly met earlier this month where it decided on the names that the provincial party would like branches to nominate for the ANC leadership contest. Ramaphosa’s name is on the top for the position of president. Gauteng ANC spokesperson Nkenke Kekana says: “The provincial executive of the ANC in Gauteng has considered the various challenges facing the ANC leading up to the December conference. We have come to the conclusion that the conference must sit and must be orderly. “And for it to be orderly, the ANC must come together as an organization, it must consider all the leaders of the ANC that have served the party.” Other names recommended for the national leadership include Lindiwe Sisulu, Gwede Mantashe, Zweli Mkhize, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and David Mabuza among others. Branches are now discussing the names and will send their nominations straight to Mantashe.
