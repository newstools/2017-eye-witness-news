                                         JOHANNESBURG – Statistician-General Pali Lehohla says the university system is not producing graduates as quickly as it is taking in new students. He says the system is constipated and needs a solution to address this as the problem is impacting on the general economic growth of the country.                                      Lehohla is presenting statistics in Pretoria on higher education institutions.  Lehohla says the country’s 26 higher education institutions have an average of 150,000 students annually but then retain a collective 800,000. He says students aren’t graduating as quickly as they should. “The system is inefficient and constipated. It means people do not progress at the rate at which they come in and that is what makes the university system very expensive, so we’re paying for people who shouldn’t be there.” Lehohla says South Africa should also be concerned by the declining number of black graduates as this directly affects the country’s growth.
