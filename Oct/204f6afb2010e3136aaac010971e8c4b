                                         DURBAN - The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) African National Congress (ANC) has told the Moerane Commission of Inquiry  that violence in South Africa was deliberately institutionalised by the apartheid state. The party is giving testimony about what it views as the underlying causes of political killings in KZN. The KZN ANC delegation, led by chairperson Sihle Zikalala  has spent most of Thursday’s session speaking about the history of colonialism and apartheid in South Africa and how these regimes created cultures of violence. Zikalala says there may be remnants of the past that remain within society, adding that the recent murders illustrate a complex mix of political decay, criminality, moral degradation and a competition for economic resources.  It’s for these reasons that Zikalala claims the murders are part of a larger societal problem. However, Zikalala has acknowledged that hitmen have played a role in exacerbating the levels of violence in KZN.      WATCH: ANC delegation appears before Moerane inquiry
