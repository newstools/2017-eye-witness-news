                                         JOHANNESBURG - The two men who assaulted and forced Rethabile Mlotshwa into a coffin say they believe the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) could present a different ruling on their hefty jail sentences. Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson were sentenced to 14 and 11 years behind bars, respectively, on Friday. They failed in their attempt for leave to appeal.  The pair made headlines last year when a video of the attack on Mlotshwa emerged. WATCH: Hefty sentences, failed appeal bid for coffin assault duo  The man who was beaten and forced into a coffin in Mpumalanga says his attackers deserve the sentences they’ve been handed. During sentencing proceedings, Mlotshwa told the court that he was still traumatised by the 2016 attack which was caught on camera. Mpumalanga ANC’s Speedy Mashilo says the conviction and hefty sentencing of the co accused is a victory for a non-racial South Africa. Justice Minister Michael Masutha has also welcomed the sentences, saying all race-related crimes must be punished. Government, political parties and Amnesty International have all welcomed the sentences handed to the men convicted in the so-called coffin case. It is unclear when the pair will approach the SCA.
