                                         CAPE TOWN - Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe’s alleged R30 million pension payout will come into sharp focus on the third day of a parliamentary inquiry into the parastatal. An official from the Eskom pension fund is expected to appear before the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises on Friday. Molefe’s departure from the parastatal is shrouded in confusion and controversy. Rules were allegedly flouted to secure his sizeable pension. Molefe’s ties to the Guptas were revealed in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report last year. The report details numerous phone calls between Molefe, the controversial Gupta brothers and their associates around the same time a Gupta-owned company acquired a coal mine that supplied some of Eskom’s power stations. Molefe left Eskom after the release of Madonsela’s report and took up a seat as an ANC member in Parliament. But he returned to the utility in May this year. The board later rescinded his reinstatement at the behest of Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
