                                         CAPE TOWN -  Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille and Mayco Member JP Smith have been placed on special leave from Democratic Alliance activities in the Cape metro.   De Lille and Smith were called to a meeting with DA leader Mmusi Maimane on Monday night. There’s a tense relationship between the two which reached fever-pitch this week. De Lille has accused Smith of making malicious and defamatory remarks against her. The DA says placing De Lille and Smith on special leave means neither of them will be able to attend party caucus meetings or interact with caucus members. They’ve also been told not to speak to the media. Their strained relationship and comments which the two have made publicly are now being probed. DA national spokesperson Phumzile van Damme said: “The special leave only pertains to the pair's work related to the party’s activities and not their roles in the government of the City of Cape Town.” De Lille on Monday night released a statement saying she had briefed her lawyers regarding Smith and some internal investigations unit members making malicious and defamatory remarks against her. This follows reports of alleged irregularities in renovations done at De Lille’s house.
