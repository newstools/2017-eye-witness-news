                                         JOHANNESBURG – A senior Gauteng Health Department official who headed the Esidimeni project has admitted that grave mistakes were made by the government, saying he regrets everything that happened. Levy Mosenogi was speaking on Wednesday during the arbitration process between the state and families of the affected psychiatric patients. One-hundred-and-eighteen mentally ill people died as a result of the moves. Mosenogi is the Gauteng Health Department’s chief director for planning, policy and research. At the time that patients were moved to Life Esidimeni, former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu had appointed him project manager. He has admitted that some patients' moves to NGOs were not adequate and was cross-examined by retired deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke. Moseneke questioned Mosenogi about the time frames before the patients were moved. Mosenogi responded: “[The time frames] were given by the leadership of the department.” Mosenogi was asked to name the leaders who pressured him. “The executive, Dr Selebano and Ms Qedani Mahlangu.” Mosenogi then admitted that he could not explain why the moves were rushed. “As a person and project manager, I have no excuse for why it was rushed.” After a few hours, Moseneke said Mosenogi's answers suggest that the process was rushed. “I have an answer. It was all irrational, it was rushed and not necessary. It was not urgent but we did it.” Mosenogi’s cross-examination continues this morning. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
