                                         DURBAN – The so-called “African National Congress (ANC) Rebels” who took the KwaZulu-Natal leadership to court say if the organisation doesn’t resolve the factions plaguing the province soon the elective conference could be a sham. The party’s top six officials led by President Jacob Zuma met with the aggrieved members on Monday to foster unity after a court judgment which nullified the outcomes of the 2015 elective conference. Zuma apparently started the gathering by acknowledging that the NEC should have handled the issues and appeals surrounding the province better. Spokesperson for the so-called “ANC Rebels” Sthembiso Mshengu says their proposed solution is to disband the KZN leadership because an unlawful structure cannot be overseeing party processes ahead of the elective conference “The right thing in this instance is to then ensure that there’s a task team and the PEC is dissolved.” He says they will, however, continue with blocking the KZN ANC’s application to appeal the recent judgment. “Sometime this week we’ll be going to the High Court in Pietermaritzburg to oppose their appeal, so that’s not dependent on the NWC and the officials. No.” Mshengu says the ANC’s top officials have agreed to return to the province soon with a final decision. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
