                                         JOHANNESBURG - Herman Mashaba  has signed a settlement with the African Diaspora Forum agreeing that he will remain cognisant of the impact his comments have on society, particularly as the mayor of Johannesburg. The terms of the agreement include that the forum will intervene as a friend of the court in the case brought by the City of Johannesburg against the Home Affairs Department. This settlement follows accusations that Mashaba made xenophobic comments which had the propensity to fuel attacks.  The mediation has been facilitated by the South African Human Rights Commission. Mashaba had much to say about his statements carried in the media. He says his comments have often been misinterpreted or chosen selectively. “This has created confusion and sensationalism around this issue.” The mayor says he condemns xenophobia in all its manifestations. “I am committed to ensuring that Johannesburg can become a safer place for all to work, live and play. I welcome foreign nationals into the city.” He says all he asks is that foreign nationals who visit the city do so lawfully. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
