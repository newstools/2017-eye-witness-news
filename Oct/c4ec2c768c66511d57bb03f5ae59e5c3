                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Russian embassy in South Africa has denied weekend reports that it had a hand in President Jacob Zuma's latest Cabinet reshuffle. The embassy has dismissed the reports as "slanderous, tabloid-grade, fake news". According to the Sunday Times, a high-level Russian delegation met with Zuma just hours before his 11th ministerial shake-up, in an effort to implement a R1 trillion nuclear build project deal. The embassy says Russia does not interfere in the domestic affairs of other sovereign states. A source has told the paper that a top-level team from Russia sent by Vladimir Putin gave a final warning to the South African authorities. According to the source, while many in the Cabinet are believed to have been recommended by the Guptas, David Mahlobo was chosen by the Russians. Itâ€™s suggested that Zuma had wanted to appoint Faith Muthambi for the post but the Russians convinced Zuma to consider Mahlobo instead. Reports suggest Zuma appears to be going for broke with the nuclear deal, brushing aside party and government conventions to finalise it before the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference in December.
