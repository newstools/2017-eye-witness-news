                                         JOHANNESBURG – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says he welcomes Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s announcement that she's taking some of his party's Members of Parliament (MPs) to court for calling her a spy. Mkhwebane intends suing DA members Glynnis Breytenbach and Werner Horn for alleged defamation  after they claimed she was a State Security Agency spy. They made the comments in September last year, prior to her appointment as public protector. Maimane says the party welcomes any opportunity to speak about Mkhwebane’s background and her capacity to do her job properly. His spokesperson Portia Adams says: “The DA welcomes any opportunity to speak about the Public Protectors background. She is more than welcome to take us to court, and we will be able to speak on whatever background we need to speak on and her ability to perform her duties; should we do so in court.”
