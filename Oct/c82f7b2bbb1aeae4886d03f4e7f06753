                                         JOHANNESBURG - Six expelled Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillors in Mogale City have filed an interdict in the High Court to stop the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) from removing them from the council. The red berets decided to sack six of its nine councillors after they defied the decision to boycott a budget vote in the municipality. The Mogale City Municipality indicated that it would inform the IEC on the process of re-electing six councillors, following the expulsion of the EFF representatives. But the lawyer representing the sacked councillors Katleho Mofokeng says they won’t allow this to happen. “We filed an interdict, interdicting the IEC from removing the names of the councillors because the matter is still pending.” He says they will be heading to court on Thursday to stop the IEC from initiating the process of removing the councillors. He argues the party didn’t follow the proper procedure of holding the disciplinary hearing.
