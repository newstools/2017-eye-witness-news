                                         CAPE TOWN – Minister Faith Muthambi’s office is refusing to comment on media reports that she’s taken steps to suspend three senior officials. However, the Public Service and Administration Minister may have to answer to MPs the next time she reports to the committee responsible for oversight of her department. Muthambi has reportedly served her chief financial officer, director-general and a deputy director-general for administration with notices of suspension. They have to give reasons why they shouldn’t be suspended. Democratic Alliance Member of Parliament Desiree van der Walt has written to the minister demanding reasons for her actions.  She says this development follows reports a few months ago that Muthambi stripped her DG of certain powers. “And I won’t be surprised at all if the suspension includes the fact that he doesn’t sign off as she pleases on finances.” Meanwhile, the committee’s acting chair, Mina Lesoma, says that she wants an assurance that the suspensions won’t destabilise the department.
