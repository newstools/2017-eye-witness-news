                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Mogale City has expelled six of its councillors on Saturday. The party announced the decision in a statement released on Sunday afternoon.  It explains that the decision was taken after its central command team met following a national disciplinary outcome in which the group was found to have contravened the EFF’s decision to boycott the Mogale City Budget vote Council meeting. Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says: “They had the democratic right to win the debate internally, but they didn’t. Instead they chose to go, and not only help the ANC council to constitute a quorum but also to vote for its budget. This goes against everything, the revolutionary tenet, that the EFF stands for.” The EFF says while the six councillors have the right to appeal, the expulsion sentence is in effect even when under appeal. It says it will communicate with the Mogale City municipal manager so as to declare the six vacancies, to allow for the replacement of those who have been expelleds.
