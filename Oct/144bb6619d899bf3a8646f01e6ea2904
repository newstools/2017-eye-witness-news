                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Police have taken in two suspects for questioning in connection with the murder of a 10-year-old Manenberg girl. The child was last seen on her way to school on Thursday morning. Her family reported her missing later in the day when she failed to arrive home from school. Her body was found at Primrose Park in Manenberg yesterday. Police say two suspects aged 29 and 32-years-old are being questioned about the girl’s murder. It’s believed the child had been severely beaten. Meanwhile, some Manenberg residents say they’re battling to come to terms with another child killing in their community. Community leader Roegshanda Pascoe wants the community to unite and create more awareness around child protection. “You start to question your relatives surrounding your children.” Pascoe says it’s difficult to trust anyone.
