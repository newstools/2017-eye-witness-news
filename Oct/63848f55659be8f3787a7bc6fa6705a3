                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma will be in the hot seat in Parliament this week when he answers questions from Members of Parliament (MPs). The issue of state capture is once again expected to loom large over his appearance in the House on Thursday, as it's been a blight on his second term in office. Combing through leaked emails, investigative journalists blew the lid on the extent of the Gupta family's apparent sway over government and state-owned companies in an explosive expose this year.  In addition to the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report and the emergence of the Gupta leaks emails, some academics and religious leaders have also homed in on the controversies surrounding the president and the family by releasing their own reports. What is the government's position on their findings?  This is what Cope parliamentarian Deidre Carter wants to know from Zuma when he replies to questions in the House on Thursday. Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane will hit on another long-standing contentious issue: the spy tapes saga. He's asked Zuma to explain how much the president's office has spent on legal costs fighting the DA's bid to have corruption charges against him reinstated. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
