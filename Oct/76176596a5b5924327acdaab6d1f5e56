                                         DURBAN - The Moerane Commission of Inquiry has heard how the political masters who are behind the hit on Sindiso Magaqa’s life will never be found.  Magaqa’s friend, Thabiso Zulu, is giving testimony for a second day in the hearings that are investigating the underlying causes of political killings in the province.   Zulu has been outspoken about the corruption in the Umzimkhulu Municipality which is apparently the reason behind the hit on Magaqa in July. “I could be killed. What happened to everyone could happen to me too. I am here to represent other people who could be killed.” Zulu spoke out against Brigadier Clifford Marion, who is part of the Moerane Commission, saying he should not have been included in the inquiry in the first place. Marion is a detective who once headed a police unit investigating political killings. Zulu says that Marion is part of the reason why cops have failed to arrest murderers. "I have lost a friend here (Sindiso Magaqa), but cases are not being solved." Zulu says there’s no sense of urgency on the part of the police when witnesses come forward with information despite a whistle-blower’s life being under threat. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
