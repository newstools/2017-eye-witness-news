                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament's Eskom inquiry will resume on Tuesday with parliamentarians to focus on the state-owned company's relationship with Trillian, a local advisory firm with links to the Gupta family. Today's hearing forms part of the public enterprises portfolio committee's probe into allegations of state capture at Eskom and other parastatals. The Gupta family is at the centre of the storm. Although Eskom denied any payments at first, it finally admitted to paying fees of R1.6 billion to McKinsey and Trillian Capital Partners. It's alleged that McKinsey partnered with Trillian to score state contracts, and that Trillian received cash for work it never did for Eskom. The committee is expected to hear from a witness whose name is being kept under wraps for security reasons. It's understood that Parliament has made arrangements to ensure the witness's identity is protected. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
