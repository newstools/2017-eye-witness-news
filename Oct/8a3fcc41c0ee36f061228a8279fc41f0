                                         JOHANNESBURG – The South African Weather Service says it’s working to develop an app that will give users weather alerts sooner to give them the opportunity to respond more effectively. The Weather Service says that although warnings were sent on time about this week’s destructive storms which hit Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, the message hardly reached communities which needed the information the most. The Weather Service gave a briefing on Thursday in Pretoria on how it dealt with this week’s storms and how it plans to improve its systems. CEO Jerry Lengoasa says: “That impact-based focus system is currently in pilot mode. We have piloted it in the Western Cape during the severe storms and here we have an opportunity to rapidly roll it out to the rest of the country with the right investments.” WATCH: Cash boost required to assist SA Weather Services predict weather  Meanwhile, the KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu has declared the province a disaster area following a massive storm that hit the province this week. At least 11 people have been killed as a result of heavy downpours and five more, including an infant, are still uncounted for. Mchunu said more than 133 schools have been affected and all patients from flooded hospital wards have been moved to safety. He said the provincial treasury will meet with sector departments to address the reprioritisation of budgets to ensure that solid delivery is strengthened. Mchunu says the executive council has agreed that the provincial government and district municipalities must urgently assess the stormwater drainage system, with a view to improving it where it's necessary. The eThekwini Municipality has warned residents of two imminent cold fronts approaching Durban on Thursday.
