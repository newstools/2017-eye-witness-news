                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Energy Department has announced that the price of both 93 and 95 octane petrol will go up by 4 cents a litre next month. The price of diesel will increase by 23 cents and 27 cents a litre respectively, while illuminating paraffin increases by 21 cents a litre. Fuel prices are adjusted on a monthly basis, informed by international and local factors. The department has attributed the price hike to the depreciation of the rand against the US dollar. The department says international factors include the fact that South Africa imports both crude oil andfinished products at a price set at the international level, including shipping costs. Earlier, the Automobile Association of South Africa predicted a fuel price hike. It warned that South Africans should prepare for further fuel price hikes before Christmas. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
