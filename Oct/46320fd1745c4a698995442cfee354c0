                                         CAPE TOWN - KPMG says paying out executives who left the firm in the wake of recent scandals should not be viewed as condoning misconduct. The auditing firm's new chief executive officer Nhlamu Dlomu  says a report by the company's international partner found no clear evidence of any criminal or illegal wrongdoing. On Friday, KPMG lost another long-term client, this time food and beverage company AVI. AVI announced that after 17 years, it will drop KPMG as its auditor by the end of next month. KPMG revealed in Parliament on Thursday that it paid severance packages to eight executives who were asked to leave the firm. The company is not saying how much they were paid. Dlomu says each payout was determined on different criteria. “It’s not just a blind cap payout.” Corporate investigations expert David Loxton says the payouts should not be viewed as the company turning a blind eye to the actions of those implicated. “They’ve got themselves certainty. They got rid of the people that they feel obviously were responsible for getting them into this mess.”
