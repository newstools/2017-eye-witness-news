                                         JOHANNESBURG – The inaugural Soweto Polo Cup has been postponed to allow the sand arena to meet the international standards required to host the event. It was set to take place on Saturday 28 October at the Soweto Equestrian Centre in Rockville, Soweto, but has since been moved to Saturday 4 November 2017. Co-founder of the event Hloni Motlhare said: “We would be doing ourselves a disservice by putting the horses and riders at risk with a sub-standard polo sand arena. Our vision is to build a world-class equestrian centre at the heart of Soweto, with the polo sand arena as the centre-piece.” The theme for the event has not changed - What Joburg means to me - as Motlhare earlier this week said. “Since this is the first one, we wanted to fuse all the different heritages that Joburg is home to… it’s all about what Joburg means to you as an individual.” Event organisers say all tickets purchased will be honoured and are 100% transferable for the new date.
