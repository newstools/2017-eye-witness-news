Patel was arrested on Friday for allegedly killing his mother at her Nirvana home in September. He's already standing trial for the 2015 murder of his 28-year-old wife Fatima. The police's Moatshe Ngoepe says Patel will remain in custody until his next court appearance. “It was postponed until 11 and 12 October for a formal bail application for the murder of his mother. Our investigations are still continuing.”
