                                         JOHANNESBURG – Eskom says it’s hoping to appoint a new evidence leader for Matshela Koko’s disciplinary hearing by Wednesday. Lawyer Sebetja Matsaung’s services were terminated at the weekend after he made threats against the Financial Mail’s deputy editor Sikonathi Mantshantsha, who was covering the hearing. Koko was suspended earlier this year and is facing various charges, including conflict of interest, after allegedly awarding a multi-million rand tender to a company that his step-daughter was involved in. Matsaung also apparently had business ties with Eskom, raising concerns about whether he should be leading evidence in Koko’s hearing. Eskom’s Khulu Phasiwe says they are now in the process of appointing a new evidence leader. “Possibly we might make the announcement by Wednesday. We’d like to have this post finalised as soon as possible so that we can move with the hearing again.”
