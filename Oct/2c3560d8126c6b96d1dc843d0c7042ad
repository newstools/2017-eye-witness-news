                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament's joint committee on ethics and members' interests has cleared Speaker Baleka Mbete of any wrongdoing related to the non-payment of an events company that organised the Annual Speaker's Ball in February. Democratic Alliance chief whip John Steenhuisen laid the complaint against Mbete alleging that she had breached the code of ethical conduct by not acting in a manner that engendered public trust. Mbete hit back, saying she was not responsible for the event at all, and the complaint has been found to have no merit. For the second consecutive year, a function billed as the Annual Speaker's Ball was held at the Bay Hotel in Camps Bay following the State of the Nation Address. In her response to the committee, Mbete says the event was privately organised and funded through donations. An events company was contracted by the organisers. Mbete says the event was never organised or funded by Parliament or her office. She only stepped in when she learnt the events company had not been paid. The service providers were subsequently paid, she says. The joint ethics and member's interests committee says it views the matter as finalised.
