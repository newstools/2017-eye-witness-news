                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille has stressed the need for reconciliation in the country. De Lille hosted a ceremonial tree-planting on Saturday morning to celebrate Mrs Leah Tutu’s 84th birthday at the historic Granary Building in the Cape Town CBD.  The building will be leased to the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation for use as a peace centre. A festive mood prevailed at the Granary Building’s reception area as delegates flocked to celebrate Leah Tutu’s 84 birthday.  She is in high spirits, jokingly thanking everything who came out to celebrate with her. “He’s given each one of us something to work on and gave me him to work on. I married a poor Bantu teacher and I ended up with an Archbishop.” De Lille and Leah Tutu ceremonially planted an olive tree in the courtyard of the premises. “The tree will be a symbol of peace and will reflect a desire for meditation, contemplation, garden and stand as a distinct monument to the life work of the Arch and Mama Leah.” Last weekend, the City of Cape Town erected the Arch for Arch, which is an architectural structure in celebration of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu’s 86th birthday.
