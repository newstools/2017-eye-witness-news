US officials and a Nigerien soldier have confirmed the vehicles they were travelling in at the time of the attack by Isis fighters earlier this month were separated. During the firefight, which lasted for hours, four US soldiers and five Nigerian officers were killed. Twenty militants were taken out. CNN’s Arwa Damon spoke to a Nigerien soldier: “He was also quite surprised that the US did not have a more aggressive response to this attack. He said perhaps now is the time for the US to reassess its mission in Niger, reassess how it’s carrying out its mission because as he puts it terrorism has now arrived in Niger.”
