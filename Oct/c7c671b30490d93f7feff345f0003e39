                                         JOHANNESBURG - Late African National Congress (ANC) president, Oliver Tambo, has been remembered as a man who upheld his morals and ethics during the fight for democracy.  Born on this day in 1917, Tambo would have turned 100-years-old this year.  Residents of Nkantolo Village in the Eastern Cape, where he was born, will honour his legacy on Friday.  President Jacob Zuma will officiate the celebrations.  His son Dali Tambo says his father will be remembered among many others who fought for freedom. “The Johnny Makhathini, Moses Mabhida, Chris Hani and so many people that worked hand-in-hand and step-by-step with OR Tambo. It’s great to have this form of public memory, we must always come forward.”
