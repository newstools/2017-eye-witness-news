                                         CAPE TOWN - Not enough attention is being paid to farm murders, so says a group of concerned South Africans, which has planned a nationwide protest against the killing of farmers and farm labourers. A convoy of vehicles will form part of the demonstration on Monday morning.  It will start at Kanonkop in Stellenbosch and then proceed on the R101.  From there, protesters will make their way to the city along Voorterkker Road. Lobby group AfriForum has given its backing to the protest.  The group’s Thomas van Dalen says: “Food security should be a matter of national priority. Every farmer that’s murdered in his farm creates a chain reaction.  “The first link in the chain reaction breaks, suddenly thousands of are out of food due to a farmer that was taken out of food supply chain as well as farmers that leave their farms out of fear for their lives.”
