                                         JOHANNESBURG â€“ The odds were stacked heavily against them going into the match and with morale low, very few if any, expected to see Bafana Bafana run rings around Burkina Faso. The dominance started 48 seconds into the match as Percy Tau found the opener, with a fairly suspicious header, but the assistant referee said it was legit. It was then the turn of Themba Zwane just after the hour, his goal coming from some amazing interplay. Itumeleng Khune with one of his special distributions, which found its way to Andile Jali and with a deft touch, he found Zwane who slotted it through. Sibusiso Vilakazi added what would be the final nail in the coffin, this time Tau turned provider with some beautiful skill. The only blemish of the match came in the second half when Bongani Zungu was sent off for violent conduct when he got involved in a scuffle. Alain Traore pulled one back with a lovely free-kick at the death, but 3-1 is how its ended.
