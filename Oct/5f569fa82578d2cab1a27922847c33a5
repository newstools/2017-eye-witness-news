                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has told lawmakers that KPMG's report into a so-called rogue unit at  the South African Revenue Service (Sars) was “grossly unfair” to former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and led to undesirable consequences. Ramaphosa was responding to a Democratic Alliance parliamentarian's question about whether he would ensure the revenue service releases the full report for public scrutiny. The deputy president was fielding questions in the National Assembly on Thursday. “It’s a very controversial report that has led to a number of consequences that are undesirable. We need to look at it very carefully.”  The firm's controversial report was used to hound Gordhan.  Parts of that report were withdrawn by KPMG last month. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
