                                         CAPE TOWN – Academic activity at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology’s (CPUT) campuses has been suspended for Tuesday.   Violent disruptions erupted at a student residence in the Cape Town CBD earlier on Monday afternoon. Protesters are demanding clarity on the outcome of a disciplinary process involving four suspended students.  CPUT spokesperson, Lauren Kansley said: “A decision has been taken to close all CPUT campuses tomorrow. This decision includes part-time classes this evening. After security assessment, any changes will be communicated via the usual channels to students, staff and parents.”  Students earlier pelted stones and rubbish at police stationed outside the building.  The residence’s doors were opened to non-protesting students who were stranded outside. This after police moved in on the protesters inside the building following a tense stand-off. These students sympathise with the protesters, saying they do have valid reasons to be agitated. “It’s a good thing because we don’t have money to pay for fees and they say if you didn’t pay your fees, don’t bother yourself coming here next here. And they are shooting us when we strike. Just because the students are fighting for poor students. So I think it’s a good thing.” Tennant Road has been reopened, with police maintaining a strong presence in the area.
