                                         VIENNA - Europe has elected its youngest head of state after the party headed by the current 31-year-old foreign minister of Austria, Sebastian Kurz, as predicted, came in with the most number of votes in Sunday's parliamentary election. The exit polls match the predictions, giving the conservative Kurz’s People's Party nearly 31% of votes. Also with a very strong showing is the Freedom Party, a right-wing Europe-sceptic party that garnered some 25%. This is a crushing blow to the European Union and essentially a strong vote against liberal politics. The two parties are widely expected to form an alliance which would see the leader of the Freedom Party, a politician with a Neo-Nazi background, enter government. Austria could now go on to resist efforts by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the French president Emmanuel Macron to reform the bloc and expand co-operation on issues such as immigration. Celebrations are taking place in the parties’ headquarters. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
