                                         JOHANNESBURG – A serial rapist who is also an armed robber has been sentenced to eleven life terms for rapes and 180-years for armed house robberies and housebreaking by the Thohoyandou High Court. The 30-year-old Max Tinashe from Zimbabwe was also sentenced to 15 years for housebreaking and another nine years for various crimes. He is convicted of 38 counts of robbery and rapes which he committed between March 2012 and April 2015 when he was arrested near the Beitbridge border post. The police say this will send a strong message to other criminals because Tinashe had terrorised the communities of Musina, especially women. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says: “The provincial commissioner has applauded a team of detectives and crime intelligence [officials] who worked hard to ensure that the serial rapist and armed robber is brought to book and given long jail times.”
