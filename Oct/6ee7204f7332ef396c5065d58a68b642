                                         CAPE TOWN - Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini is updating MPs on the progress made on social grant payouts over the last two weeks. Sassa and the Post Office are headed for a showdown in Parliament on Tuesday over the payment of grants. On Monday, Dlamini announced that the agency will put out to tender three of the four services required for grant payments because the Post Bank can't provide them. Dlamini, along with Telecommunications Minister Siyabonga Cwele, are today expected to explain how negotiations have reached this point at a joint meeting of the Social Development Committee and the Scopa. The minister has evaded meetings a number of meeting to update MPs on the negotiations. Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) chairperson Themba Godi said that if Minister Dlamini is a no-show at Tuesdayâ€™s meeting she will be subpoenaed.
