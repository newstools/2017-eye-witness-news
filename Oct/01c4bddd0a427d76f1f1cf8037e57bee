Former Eskom employee Ted Blom sketched broad details about corruption at the parastatal, claiming there are up to a thousand cases, many of them unreported. CAPE TOWN - Parliament's probe into state capture at Eskom  has been told about a culture of kickbacks and large-scale procurement irregularities at the parastatal. Former Eskom employee and self-proclaimed corruption whistleblower Ted Blom briefed the Public Enterprises committee charged with the probe on Wednesday. Blom and former Eskom CEO Brian Dames were the latest witnesses to appear before the committee. Blom, who now heads Outa’s energy division, sketched broad details about corruption at Eskom, claiming that there are up to a thousand cases, many of them unreported. He took the committee back in time and in an astonishing revelation he claimed to have met with Jacob Zuma at his Forest Town home in 2009 to alert him to the irregularities. Zuma was president of the African National Congress but not yet the country at the time. Zuma allegedly told him to meet a team of “fixers”, but Blom told Members of Parliament that the group had a different agenda. “They introduced themselves and the first question was: Given my vast experience of Eskom, over more than 20-odd years, how could I help them to access some of the gravy train?” Blom left the meeting furious that he was supposedly being roped into a plan to loot the state-owned company. Parliamentarians asked Blom for the names of the so-called “fixers,” which he promised to provide them with at a later stage. Earlier, Dames told the committee that Minister Malusi Gigaba’s adviser Siyabonga Mahlangu asked him to meet with “some people,” one of whom he assumed was a Gupta brother. But Dames claims he can’t recall who it was.
