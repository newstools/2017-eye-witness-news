                                         JOHANNESBURG – President Jacob Zuma says he is certain the cooperation between South Africa and Zimbabwe will lead to economic emancipation for the citizens of the countries. Zuma was giving welcoming remarks during the second session of the South Africa Zimbabwe binational commission in Pretoria. Both President Robert Mugabe and Zuma are joined by some of their Cabinet ministers. The meeting will review bilateral relations between the two countries. Zuma says the focus must be on the transformation of the economy. “The diversification of our economies and industrialisation will ultimately put the region on the right footpath as the global economy continues to play its own role.” President Robert Mugabe says he is happy to join hands with South Africa to ensure this transformation. “This strategic partnership is an instrument for achieving the profound transformation of our countries’ economies, so let us join hands.” WATCH: SA, Zimbabwe binational commission
