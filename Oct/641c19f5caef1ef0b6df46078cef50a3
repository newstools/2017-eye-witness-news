                                         PARLIAMENT - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has made it clear that there will be no retrospective review of work done for the government by the embattled audit firm KPMG. Ramaphosa’s explanation comes after Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba advised state departments and their entities to review KPMG’s work for them to ensure audit processes have not been compromised. Ramaphosa was asked to explain the cost of Gigaba’s directive during a question and answer session in the National Assembly on Thursday afternoon. Ramaphosa says Gigaba has informed him that his directive on KPMG does not involve a retrospective review of all work the firm has done for the government. “The statement was to give guidance that they consider the factor surrounding this audit firm when they do so because they have to do so themselves at their annual general meeting, and therefore a guidance statement was issued.” KPMG has come under fire for its work for the Guptas and the South African Revenue Service (Sars). The firm’s controversial report on a so-called rogue unit at the revenue service was used to dog former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Parts of that report were withdrawn by KPMG in September. “The report itself was grossly unfair to Gordhan.” Asked by a Democratic Alliance MP whether Gordhan would get an apology, Ramaphosa said any apology should come from the ministry responsible for Sars and not him.
