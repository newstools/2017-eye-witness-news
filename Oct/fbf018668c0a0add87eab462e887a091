News24 is reporting that Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini is likely to announce that Sassa should find a new service provider for the payment of grants to more than 17 million beneficiaries through an open tender process. A press conference has been planned for Tuesday.  Meanwhile, the Post Office says it will take some time to consider a way forward in a proposed social grants deal.
