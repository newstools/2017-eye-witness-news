                                         CAPE TOWN - Wesgro  CEO Tim Harris says the agency has contributed R17 billion to the Western Cape economy over the past year. The trade, investment and tourism promotion agency delivered its annual review in Cape Town on Tuesday. The agency operates at the behest of the Western Cape Government and the City of Cape Town. Harris says the agency has 'outperformed' in 2016-17 financial year, amid a harsh economic climate. “We’re looking at about a R17 billion contribution to the Cape economy across all of our mandates. That includes the R2 billion investment that we brought in and the R9 billion exports that we helped facilitate.” He adds Wesgro's success is due to a trusting relationship between the private and public sector among other factors. “An initiative like the one-stop shop we just landed in St George’s mall that we delivered in conjunction with the DTI, that’s really going to improve the ease of doing business in the Cape.” Wesgro says by securing new and expanding air routes, it has contributed to a 27% increase in international traffic to Cape Town International Airport in the first six months of 2017 year-on-year.
