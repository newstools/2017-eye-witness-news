CAPE TOWN - The attack at a Stellenbosch social cafe is now believed to have been a hit. A 40-year-old man and a woman were killed during a shooting incident at Cubana lounge, in the early hours of Saturday morning. An eyewitness says the gunman targeted shots directly at the 40-year-old man, who ran through a crowd of people on the dance floor in pursuit of refuge. “The shooter was wearing a hoodie and so no one could really see who he was.” He elaborates on the events that unfolded shortly after the shooters fled the scene. “Immediately after the gun left, I went to check on the lady and I could see that they shot her on the head.” Investigators were searching for more clues at the crime scene on Saturday.
