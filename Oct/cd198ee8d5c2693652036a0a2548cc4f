                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Socio-Economic Rights Institute (SERI) says citizens and residents of Johannesburg should be the ones to push back against xenophobic remarks made by Mayor Herman Mashaba.  Mashaba has on numerous occasions claimed that people living in hijacked buildings across the city are mostly foreigners. The institute along with other civil rights groups and NGOs are being hosted by the South African Human Rights Commission at an indaba, focusing on migrant housing.  SERI’s Alana Potter says it’s up to people living in Johannesburg to decide how to support the human rights of everyone in South Africa. “What we’re pushing against here is not a couple of crazy senior politicians who are looking for votes and are saying things that they think their constituents want to hear, we’re pushing against a global trend.” The commission says it received a complaint against Mayor Mashaba last year.  The commission says it will be facilitating a discussion between Mashaba and the African Diaspora Forum on Thursday.
