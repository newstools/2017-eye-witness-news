                                         CAPE TOWN – An Avian Veterinarian says the current bird flu that has hit the Western Cape is a lot worse than they think. The outbreak has seen more than two million birds have died or culled in the province so far since June. The World of Birds in Hout Bay also confirmed that just under 200 of its birds had to be culled as a result. Doctor Deon de Beer from the Klapmuts Bird Clinic has described the current strain of bird flu as a disaster. De Beer says there are several factors contributing towards the problem. “We’re sitting with this problem. We had an increase in the past months. We sit with a new strain of this avian flu and this is why it spread like a wildfire. The Western Cape is now almost in every corner sitting with this worse outbreak.”
