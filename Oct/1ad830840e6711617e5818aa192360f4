                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has welcomed the arrests of three security officers for assaulting a patron at the Shoprite Usave in Cosmo City. The private guards were caught on camera last Saturday, manhandling and handcuffing a mother whose child relieved herself outside the shop. The MEC says she hopes this sends a strong message that gender-based violence won’t be tolerated. Her spokesperson Busaphi Nxumalo said: “Following the shocking assault incident, she is confident that with evidence at the police’s disposal, they will represent a water-tight case to ensure that these security officers receive the harshest possible terms behind bars.”
