                                         JOHANNESBURG - Lenasia residents have expressed outrage and condemnation of the City of Johannesburg for cancelling cremations on weekends at the Avalon crematorium. In a statement, the city's Reggie Moloi says the weekend cremations are in violation of the city's by-laws and therefore would be discontinued. Moloi says cremations may only take place on weekdays from 9am to 2pm. He says if there is an emergency with residents requiring cremation after the prescribed weekend times, they must submit a formal application and a prescribed fee before the service can be conducted. Lenasia ward councillor Kishore Badal says the by-law is decades old and was waived about 35 years ago. Badal says the decision by the City is unacceptable and he has engaged authorities on the matter, including the MMC for Community Development Nonhlanhla Sifumba. “This is unacceptable. After years of having it in place, why is it being changed now and why was there no public consultation? We are the main stakeholders, why are the religious beliefs of those in Lenasia not being taken into consideration?” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
