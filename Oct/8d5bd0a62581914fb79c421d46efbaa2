                                         CAPE TOWN - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula is hoping to have a permanent National Police Commissioner in place before the end of the year, saying that stable leadership is key to fighting crime. He was speaking during the release of the annual national crime statistics in Parliament on Tuesday. The post has not been permanently filled since former top cop Riah Phiyega’s appointment. Her term came to an end in June this year while suspended on full pay. Mbalula says that there’s been a lack of stability in leadership in the police for several years. "Police need to be led properly, they need leadership. Now, we’ve had General Selebi, we had Bheki Cele, he brought progress in the police but he could not finish his term. And then we had Riah Phiyega and then from there we had acting police commissioners." Lawmakers agree that it’s vital for the president to appoint a permanent police commissioner in order to deal with challenges in the service. Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Francois Beukman, says that the commissioner should be a competent person with innovative plans to fight crime and corruption.
