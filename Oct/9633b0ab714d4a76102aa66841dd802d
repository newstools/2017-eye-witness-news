                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Presidency says that it is concerned about the possible intimidation of journalists at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), who have no problem with speaking with government institutions. In a statement released on Tuesday night, the Presidency dismisses claims by the so-called SABC 8 journalists that spokesperson Bongani Nqulunga had a secret meeting with the acting head of news, Nyana Molete. They claim the meeting was to affirm the SABC news division as a propaganda tool for the African National Congress. The Presidency, however, says the meeting was to provide information about its day to day functions, as it does with other media institutions. It’s also welcomed the SABC 8 to contact them should they need information from the Presidency.
