                                         CAPE TOWN - The Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors has told lawmakers its investigation into KPMG will likely include the conduct of the auditor who signed off on a forensic report about a so-called rogue unit at the South African Revenue Services (Sars).  The regulator on Tuesday briefed Parliament’s Finance Committee on the scope of its probe which could now include KPMG’s bungling of the Sars report. The auditing firm is also under the microscope for failing to flag allegedly irregular cash flows when it audited the Gupta-owned Linkway Trading. In June, the regulator announced it was investigating KPMG’s audit of Linkway Trading, a company that played a crucial role in allegedly channelling public funds from the Free State government to pay for a lavish Gupta family wedding at Sun City in 2013. The regulator is not stopping there. Chief executive Bernard Agulhas says it’s likely to extend the scope of its probe. “What we have determined in the meantime is that report was signed off by a registered auditor which means that it could come into our jurisdiction to investigate.” Agulhas has explained that the forensic report as a whole won’t be investigated because the regulator can only probe the conduct of the auditor who signed off on it. KPMG International recently repudiated the findings of that report, saying the investigation fell short of the firm’s own standards. The findings had been used to hound former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and other senior Sars officials accused of setting up a covert intelligence unit at the revenue service.
