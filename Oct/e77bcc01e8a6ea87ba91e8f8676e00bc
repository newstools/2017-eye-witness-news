                                         DURBAN - The South African Communist Party (SACP) in KwaZulu-Natal says it doesn’t regret being at the forefront of bringing Jacob Zuma to power 10 years ago because it believed there was a great miscarriage of justice at the time. The party held a briefing in Durban on Monday to share the outcomes of a special meeting held at the weekend, after the sudden axing of general secretary Blade Nzimande. The SACP says that Zuma’s latest decision has been driven by the breakdown in his personal relationship with Nzimande. LISTEN: 'Zuma's latest Cabinet reshuffle worse than irrational'  The party’s Richard Mthembu says South Africa will one day pay the price for the current internal squabbles plaguing the African National Congress (ANC). “We are tearing each other apart and allowing the decay within the ANC. I’m sure, comrade Oliver Tambo is turning in his grace.” When asked if the SACP regrets campaigning for politically estranged Jacob Zuma to become president, Mthembu gave a resounding “no”. “At the time, we strongly believed that we were correct.” The SACP in Kwazulu-Natal has called on ANC MPs who want to stop Parliaments probe into state capture to be recalled.
