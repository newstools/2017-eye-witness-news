                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Council for The Advancement of South African Constitution (Casac) says the Supreme Court of Appeal’s judgement strikes another blow against the credibility and integrity of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), and its capacity to exercise its mandate without fear, favour or prejudice. Casac has welcomed the court’s verdict to dismiss the appeals by President Jacob Zuma and the NPA against the NPA decision to withdraw the fraud, corruption and racketeering charges against the president. It says President Zuma has deliberately weakened institutions of governance, especially those in the criminal justice sector for his personal benefit. The council says it believes it is in the public interest and the interests of justice for the charges to be prosecuted immediately.
