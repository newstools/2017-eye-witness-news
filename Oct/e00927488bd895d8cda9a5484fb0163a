                                         JOHANNESBURG - Low-cost airline Mango  says 25% of its flights have been affected by a strike over a salary increase for pilots. Over 100 workers affiliated to trade union Solidarity are demanding an 8.5% wage hike while the employer is offering 6%. Talks between the union and management broke down on Sunday night. Mango spokesperson Sergio dos Santos said, “An hour at this stage, was the longest that people had to wait for a flight. We are in fact using some of our new planes and also some of our competing airline companies.” Meanwhile, trade union Solidarity says the strike will continue indefinitely until management agrees to renegotiate salaries. The trade union says they are waiting on management to reschedule a meeting after talks broke down. Spokesperson Deon Reyneke says it’s strange that Mango doesn't mind losing millions a day over this strike but won't increase salaries. “The company at this stage is paying R10 million a day for this strike. It’s a little strange that it’s willing to pay that much but don’t want to pay a few millions a year.”
