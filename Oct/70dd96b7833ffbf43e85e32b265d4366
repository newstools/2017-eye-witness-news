                                         PRETORIA - The names of 27 people including President Jacob Zuma, several of his family members, the Guptas and presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma are among a list sent to British financial authorities to be investigated for possible links to international money laundering.  The details are revealed in a letter that former anti-apartheid activist Lord Hain sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip Hammond in September.  It emerged on Thursday that the FBI is also investigating the Guptas for alleged money laundering.   Lord Hain says in his letter that it has become clear that South Africa is gripped by a political, economic and social crisis precipitated by a vast criminal network facilitated by the Guptas and the Zumas.  He says that corruption and cronyism is plundering taxpayer resources on a grand scale.  Hains warns that the Gupta/Zuma network is not localised to South Africa but enabled by a transnational money laundering network which includes bank accounts and global financial institutions.  Hain says while the Gupta family's financial crimes are widely documented, South Africa’s prosecuting authorities have yet to take action because they are regarded as having been compromised.  Member of Parliament Philip Hammond responded, saying that the letter had been forward to the relevant UK law enforcement agencies.
