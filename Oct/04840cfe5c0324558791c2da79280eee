                                         JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has called on scholar patrol guards who take pride in their duties to restore dignity back in the sector following a string of sexual abuse cases at Gauteng schools. Lesufi met with school guards in the south of Johannesburg on Sunday. The Education Department has been dealing with a number of sexual assault cases, most recently a school driver who allegedly raped a 13-year-old girl at a primary school in Westonaria. He’s expected to appear in court on Monday. The Education MEC has issued a stern warning to those who abuse school children. “We’ll hunt you and we’ll ask the police to send you to a long-term sentence in jail.” Lesufi says the government will be introducing a new code of conduct which all those responsible for safety at schools must adhere to. “How you greet people, how you conduct yourselves, how you talk to other people and how you protect our children.” The Education MEC has also reiterated that scholar patrol guards who have not been re-vetted will not be allowed into any school in the province from January next year.
