                                         JOHANNESBURG – Police Minister Fikile Mbalula  has reacted to the latest political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. He says that around 40 people have been arrested since the establishment of a task team earlier this year.  Mbalula says that there will be more arrests soon. “I’m not just optimistic or hopeful, I’m sure we’re going to make big arrests in KZN. That’s what I can say.” The police minister has previously said that the killings involve corruption and the abuse of state resources. At the time, he visited the notorious Glebelands hostel in Umlazi, Durban. The hostel, which is largely seen as a base for contract killers suspected of being involved in politically fuelled assassinations in the province, has come under scrutiny during the Moerane Commission of Inquiry, which is investigating political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. The minister had instructed the Hawks to investigate the Umzimkhulu Municipality and review the administration of tender documents and processes. The minister believes that many private security companies are involved in criminal activities. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
