                                         CAPE TOWN – Democratic Alliance (DA) Western Cape chairperson Anton Bredell says measures have been put in place to deal with any internal issues in the party. Bredell, who was re-elected for this position on Saturday, was commenting on a question about the recent public spat between Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille and mayco member JP Smith. Both de Lille and Smith have been placed on special leave. As a result, they've been banned from the party's  activities. In a statement this week de Lille said she was consulting lawyers about malicious and defamatory remarks made by Smith, for claims he made about the closure of the city's special investigations unit. Smith has told Eyewitness News that party leadership had ordered him not to comment on the matter.  Bredell says such issues must be tackled head-on. “We will ensure that there is a fair process to deal with any disciplinary matter and that there's no political agenda to get rid of people. We’re not an organisation that gets rid of its people. There are personality clashes and we will deal with it.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
