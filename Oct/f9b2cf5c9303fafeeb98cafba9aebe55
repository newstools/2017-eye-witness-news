                                         JOHANNESBURG - Presidential hopeful Lindiwe Sisulu says much like the African National Congress (ANC), the MK Veterans need to unite as a matter of urgency. Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans are holding a national conference in the south of Johannesburg over the next two days. #MKCouncil Sisulu says everyone at loggerheads needs to put everything aside now.

However, my request on behalf of the ANC is that we need all of us to rise above whatever has happened in the meantime.” Sisulu has repeatedly called for unity among ANC members. During the recent Ahmed Kathrada annual fundraising banquet in Fordsburg, the presidential hopeful said the ruling party would need to reinvent itself starting at its 54th national conference in December this year.  She also recently stated that MKMVA was used for ulterior motives. “I think there is a section of uMkhonto we Sizwe that is using the institution of being MK for other reasons other than making sure that we can provide the welfare of all MK soldiers.” WATCH: Lindiwe Sisulu: We must revive ANC's values  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
