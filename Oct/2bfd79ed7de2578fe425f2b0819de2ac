                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) insists it submitted its report which vetted the credentials of those recommended for the SABC board  hours before its deadline. Its directly contradicted Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo's claim that her department had failed to submit the names to the Presidency because the authority had failed to meet the two-day deadline. Parliament completed its interviews of the public broadcaster candidates last month and submitted the recommended names to President Jacob Zuma to make a final decision on appointments, but the board has still not been appointed. Dlodlo blames the qualification authority for the delay, but its CEO Joe Samuels says it met the deadline. “The work was completed before 10 o’clock on Thursday 5 October. I’ve just confirmed. So, it was a complete surprise to me that there was a suggestion that SAQA had missed the deadline.”
