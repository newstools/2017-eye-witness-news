                                         CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the City of Cape Town says it has proof that Patricia De Lille  lied about using public money to renovate her private home. Earlier, party members picketed outside the mayor's Pinelands house but the council speaker says they have it all wrong. There were only a few demonstrators, but Dullah Omar Region Chairperson Xolani Sotashe says it's not about the numbers. The issue of upgrades to de Lille’s home has become a flashpoint in recent weeks both in the city and within the Democratic Alliance. The council speaker in the City of Cape Town has confirmed just over R450, 000 was spent on security upgrades to Mayor de Lille's private home. The council had approved a budget of R700, 000 for the work but they managed to save costs. As an elected official de Lille is entitled to security upgrades paid for by the public purse. But earlier on Thursday, Sotashe  claimed he has invoices made out to the City of Cape Town for further work done to de Lille’s house in 2016. Sotashe has shown Eyewitness News invoices issued to the City for renovations, which they say is proof of illicit dealings. “We are coming to beg the mayor just to quietly pay back the money of the taxpayers and up until this day, she has not proven us wrong. If she believes that she paid for herself for these renovations, she is supposed to prove that to everybody that ‘here is the proof’.” Sotashe says they intend submitting the documents to the Public Protector's office. The ANC planned a picket outside CT mayor Patricia #DeLille’s house for 12pm. A few members here, incl ANC WC chairman Xolani Sotashe.
