                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Guild of Nigerian Professionals group has criticised a local governor’s decision to erect a statue of President Jacob Zuma calling it unacceptable. Zuma was awarded the highest honour during a visit to Nigeria’s Imo State at the weekend. A street has also been named after him. However, the professionals' group says the statue is not beneficial to Nigerians and the money could have been used for something else. The group’s Adetunuji Omotolo says: “We don’t even have a statue of Nelson Mandela, we don’t have a statue of Barack Obama, we don’t have a statue of Martin Luther King, all the great black icons. “We don’t have them anywhere in Nigeria and now we have the statue of president Zuma. It’s not the best PR exercise, if you ask me.” #ZumaStatue Yesterday President Zuma was honoured in Nigeria’s Imo State with a giant statue and a street has been named after him.
