                                         CAPE TOWN - Western Province coach John Dobson wants his side to enjoy the unique experience of being in a Currie Cup final. Province travel to Durban to take on the Sharks on Saturday. It is their fifth final in six years and if they win, it will be their 34th title in the competition's 100-year history. Dobson used the recently deceased and legendary South African player Tom van Vollenhoven as an example of what a final means. "Probably one the greatest rugby league players from Britain of all time and his greatest memory was of the Currie Cup final because he only played in one. There are some great Springboks who never played in a Currie Cup final and that message we have got across to our players, not in a pressured way, but to appreciate the experience, from enjoying it now, to when people wish them good luck at the airport, they must really enjoy it." Dobson says he has been impressed with the recent rise in interest in the competition. "I think its great for the tournament, the developments in the last few weeks because it's a unique event in world rugby and hopefully its going to be a great occasion. I think what the Sharks are doing by saying fill the [Shark] Tank, that great for the occasion as well. We're going to empty it."
