                                         CAPE TOWN - Manenberg residents will stage a protest march on Wednesday following the killing of a 10-year-old girl in the area. Charnelle McCrawl's body was found last Friday. Two men have since been arrested and charged with her murder. Community leader Roegshanda Pascoe says: “We have to deal with the fact that Charnelle was horrifically ripped from this community. We know the underlying issues, we are saying enough is enough. We won’t stand for this anymore.” It is believed that one of the suspects is related to the child. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
