                                         HARARE - Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai is back in South Africa for medical attention, just two weeks after his last trip. The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader is being treated for colon cancer, raising concerns in Zimbabwe over his fitness to stand in next year’s elections. Tsvangirai returned to Zimbabwe a fortnight ago after a month spent receiving medical treatment in South Africa; now he's back again. A senior MDC official says Tsvangirai caught a scheduled flight to Johannesburg on Friday morning, the official said it wasn't an emergency, just a check-up.  Writing on Facebook, his spokesman Luke Tamborinyoka dismissed private press reports that Tsvangirai is critically ill.  “He came back knowing full well he would return for a review and he went for the review as scheduled,” Tamborinyoka said. He could not say when he expected Tsvangirai back. Tsvangirai was diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago. The MDC leader is set to stand in next year’s elections, although there have been doubts expressed both within the party and outside as to his fitness to stand the rigours of a re-election campaign.
