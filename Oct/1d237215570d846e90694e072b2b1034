                                         HARARE - President Robert Mugabe’s ruling party says it aims to raise $8 million towards its end-of-year congress, at a time of severe cash shortages. The meeting is set to re-affirm Mugabe as the party’s candidate in next year’s elections. Ruling party’s secretary for finance Obert Mpofu says each of the party’s 10 provinces is expected to donate $100,000, as well as food and cattle. Zanu-PF's special congress may also see a post created for a female vice president. Mpofu says the private and public sectors will also be approached for financial support. These are big demands at a time of growing economic difficulties. The head of the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe Charity Jinya told Tuesday’s state-run Herald that only exporters can now expect to get cash from banks.
