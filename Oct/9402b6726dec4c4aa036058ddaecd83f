                                         DURBAN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the disunity currently displayed within the African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal will dampen the party’s efforts to bring change to the constituencies they serve. Ramaphosa was addressing the Young Communist League’s Centenary Celebration at Curries Fountain in Durban.  He has been joined by provincial alliance leaders and some of the so-called “ANC rebels” who took the KZN executive to court. Ramaphosa started off his address by sending his condolences to the bereaved families of those who lost loved ones during this week’s storms in KZN.   Ramaphosa spoke about the disunity in KZN saying it saddens the national leaders to see the ANC’s strongest province in this state. “For as long as the ANC is disunited in KZN, we will not be able to fulfil the promise that we’ve made to our people.” Ramaphosa says the ANC remains the only hope for South Africa but the party must resolve its own internal issues in order to fulfil its promises.
