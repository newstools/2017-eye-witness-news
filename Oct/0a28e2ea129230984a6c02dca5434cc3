                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Automobile Association of South Africa says it expects the fuel prices to rise when the Energy Department  makes an announcement this week. It says the full effect of the rand's weakening, in the wake of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba's medium-term budget policy statement, have not yet been felt. The association says this means that South Africans should prepare for further fuel price hikes before Christmas. Spokesperson Layton Beard says: “The rand slipped around 22 cents to the US dollar, meaning all grades of fuel will be more expensive in November. We are predicting that petrol will rise a modest 4 cents per litre, diesel users could pay up to 20 cents more and illuminating paraffin is set to rise by 18 cents.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
