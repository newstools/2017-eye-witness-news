                                         BENGALURU - West Ham United defender Winston Reid believes Friday’s Premier League match against a promoted Brighton and Hove Albion is a must-win game for his team following Saturday’s draw against Burnley. The London side looked set for only their third win of the season on Saturday before Burnley’s Chris Wood cancelled out Michail Antonio’s first-half strike. The 1-1 draw left Slaven Bilic’s side 15th in the table with eight points from as many games. “We will look to bounce back next week, we have a game against Brighton on Friday night and we have to win that game,” Reid told the club’s website. “Hopefully we will do well this season, but we need to start picking up some more wins so that we can get further up the table,” the New Zealand international added. “We had a very poor first three games and we have had some injuries but we have got just about all our injured players back now and you could see there are good players that can’t even get on to the bench.” Brighton are a spot above West Ham in the table with the same number of points.
