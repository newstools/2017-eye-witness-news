                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Education Department says recent gang violence flare-ups in Cape Town have had a direct impact on several schools. A 16-year-old pupil was stabbed to death at a Delft school last week. A grade 11 learner at Crystal High in Hanover Park was injured in an attack earlier in October. The department says it’s trying its best to protect pupils and teachers. Provincial Education MEC Debbie Schafer, however, adds the department simply doesn’t have the legislative mandate, security capabilities or budget to guarantee their safety at schools. She says this is an issue the department can’t tackle on its own, reiterating communities also need to step in. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
