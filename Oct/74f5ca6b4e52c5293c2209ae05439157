                                         CAPE TOWN - Energy expert Chris Yelland has stressed the importance of following a rational process in the procurement of nuclear as an energy source for the country. He was reacting to the appointment of David Mahlobo as Energy Minister in President Jacob Zuma’s 12th Cabinet reshuffle since he took office in 2009. Mahlobo is taking over the portfolio from Mmamoloko Kubayi, seven months after she replaced Tina Joemat-Pettersson. Yelland stresses the need for this portfolio to be filled by someone with experience. “It’s one of the most important ministries on which the entire country, economy and productive, domestic and private sectors rely on.” He describes Mahlobo's appointment as suspicious. “It seems to be astounding that only a month ago Minister Mahlobo was in Russia putting together a private oil deal and now he’s the minister of energy.”
