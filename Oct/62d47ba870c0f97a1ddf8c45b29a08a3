                                         JOHANNESBURG - Numsa is pushing for the scrapping of boards at all state-owned entities (SOEs). The mining union says the current board members are not acting in the interests of the public and are allowing the looting of resources. The union says SOE boards must be made up of trade union representatives, business and government officials. The union believes this will guarantee transparency, good governance and accountability at SOEs. Numsa also says the Gupta family must be investigated for meddling with SOEs, adding all state capture allegations should be ventilated in court. The union’s spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi explains: “Workers and their families are suffering from the impact of corruption at various SOEs, including South African Airways, the Road Accident Fund, PetroSA and Prasa, just to name a few. That’s why we’re demanding that the boards of all SOEs must be scrapped and democratised.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
