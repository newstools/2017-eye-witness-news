This comes as law enforcement officials are beefing up security in Philippi following the murder of eleven people in separate shootings about two weeks ago. The city’s JP Smith said: “On Saturday morning, at approximately 3am, Metro Police officers pulled over a blue Fiat Uno during a vehicle checkpoint in Philippi East.  “Officers spotted a firearm inside a vehicle prompting a search. They recovered stolen pistol with a serial number filed off, a magazine and seven rounds of ammunition.” Meanwhile, in another incident on Saturday morning, two people were shot and killed at the Cubana social cafe in Stellenbosch when gunmen opened fire at the establishment.
