                                         JOHANNESBURG - Cosmetics giant Dove says its latest campaign for body wash, which has caused outrage worldwide for being racist, should not have happened. A short video clip was posted on the company's US Facebook page showing a black woman taking off her brown T-shirt and turning into a white woman after using the product.  Dove says it “missed the mark” in thoughtfully representing women of colour. In a statement, Dove apologised for any offence caused by the advert and said it doesn’t condone any activity or imagery that insults any audience. It acknowledged that the campaign doesn’t represent the diversity of real beauty and says the post has since been removed from its social media platforms. However, screenshots of the original advert have already been widely circulated on social media, with some calling for a ban on all Dove and Unilever products in South Africa.
