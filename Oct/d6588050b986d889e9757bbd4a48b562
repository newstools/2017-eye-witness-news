                                         PRETORIA - A massive data breach has been detected which is being described as the biggest ever leak of private information in South Africa’s history. The personal records of as many as 33 million people have been leaked onto the internet. An Australian-based Microsoft Professional and security developer made the discovery on Tuesday. About 27 gigabytes of data containing the names, full identity numbers, income, employment history and even home addresses of 33 million South Africans have been uploaded onto the internet. It’s unclear at this stage if the leak was the result of a hack or negligence, or which company is the source of the data. Australian-based Troy Hunt tweeted on Tuesday that he’d confirmed the data as legitimate and contains South African 13-digit identity numbers. While the State Security Agency has not commented on the breach, it’s understood the matter is being investigated.
