                                         JOHANNESBURG - National Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane says it would be irresponsible not to bail out South African Airways (SAA). On Friday, National Treasury announced it's transferred R3 billion from the National Revenue Fund to the airline to help it repay part of a loan from Citibank. It says the latest lifeline was given to SAA as part of its plans to make the airline commercially viable. The latest bailout has been heavily criticised by the opposition.  But Mogajane says they believe in SAA. “We cannot throw money in a deep, black hole because it will again be irresponsible. We believe in a long-term turnaround strategy put in place and we think it will start bearing fruits.” He's also responded to weekend reports that Treasury is captured. “We must put it out and make it clear: I’m are not captured, we’re not captured in the Treasury and we will continue to do our work the way we have to.” LISTEN: Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane speaks to The Money Show's Bruce Whitfield.
