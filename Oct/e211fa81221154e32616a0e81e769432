                                         JOHANNESBURG – Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's campaigners have denied claims that their operation is funded by controversial businessman Adriano Mazzotti. Those behind her campaign for the African National Congress's (ANC) top post are responding to media reports on Sunday that Mazzotti, a self-confessed cigarette smuggler, is one of her contributors. The businessman reportedly signed an affidavit in 2014, in which he admits that he and his company were complicit in a host of crimes including money laundering. Dlamini-Zuma's campaign spokesperson Carl Niehaus claims the Sunday Times report is peddling "fake news".“Primarily this campaign is being funded and run through volunteers – people who don’t demand money for their time but would do it out of commitment.”
