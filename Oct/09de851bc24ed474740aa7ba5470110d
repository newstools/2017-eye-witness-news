                                         LADYSMITH - Police are still combing the scene of a mass shooting in Ladysmith where at least 10 people were killed. Police say a member of the Klipriver Taxi Association was travelling on the N11 on Tuesday morning when a group of armed men ambushed him and four of his security guards. He lost control of the vehicle and crashed into an oncoming vehicle believed to be carrying teachers and pupils. Family members who have been called to the scene by authorities are standing behind the SA Police Service tape which separates the crowd from the bodies that are still lying on Matiwaneskop Road. The relatives are reluctant to speak to the media at this stage because they still need to identify their loved ones. It’s understood that the deputy chairperson of the Klipriver Taxi Association was the target of Tuesday’s assassination. The uThukela District mayor Dudu Mazibuko is also waiting for feedback from the scene that’s been combed since 7 o’clock on Tuesday morning.  TAXI FEUD Eyewitness News understands that there has been a longstanding taxi feud in the area between the Klipriver and Eyesizwe associations. It’s not clear at this stage what the dispute is about but EWN has been told that there was a fatality on Monday night with a member from one of the association. The very same taxi boss who was shot and killed on Tuesday is said to have been recovering from gunshot wounds from another attack last week. Tuesday morning’s ambush has also claimed the lives of five teachers, but the number of fatalities is yet to be confirmed by authorities. From a distance, one could see pathologists handling rifles and other weapons as they continue to clear the scene on Matiwaneskop Road. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
