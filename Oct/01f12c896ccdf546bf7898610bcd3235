                                         PRETORIA – Sporting goods supplier Sedgars Sports has denied it paid for Police Minister Fikile Mbalula’s family holiday to Dubai despite compelling evidence to the contrary. Eyewitness News has established that the company is believed to have paid at least half of a R680,000 trip the minister took over the new year period. Sedgars supplies clothing to South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) for Team South Africa and most recently provided outfits at the Rio Olympics last year. At the time of the trip, Mbalula was the Minister of Sport. Eyewitness News has established that a company called Reimon Uniforms transferred R300,000 to a travel agent to pay for Mbalula’s Dubai trip. Sedgars’ Yusuf Dockrat denies paying for the trip and says Reimon Uniforms has a purely business relationship with his company, but company records suggest otherwise. Sources have told Eyewitness News Reimon Uniforms is an inactive company whose bank account is used to channel funds to and from Sedgars’ accounts. Records also show Reimon shares a postal address with a company Dockrat was previously a director of. They also reveal that Reimon’s director Zakkiyah Dockrat is possibly related to the Sedgars’ Dockrats and that the company's former director is now employed at Sedgars. When all this was put to Dockrat, he declined to answer further questions. Mbalula has neither confirmed nor denied Sedgars paid for the trip, but insists there is nothing untoward and that Eyewitness News’s facts and his facts are quite possibly in dispute.
