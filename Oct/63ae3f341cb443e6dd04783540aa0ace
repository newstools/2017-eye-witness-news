                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has issued a warning to Maritzburg College in KwaZulu-Natal against the school’s plans to conduct disciplinary hearings against two of three pupils. This is after an image of them holding EFF branded T-shirts on school grounds went viral last week. The image of the three pupils in school uniform sparked different reactions on Twitter over the weekend, with some calling for harsh punishment. The party says that it has confirmed that the school is planning to take steps against the pair holding the T-shirts on the image and not the third learner. The EFF’s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says that a school’s constitution should not violate the country’s Constitution. “By charging these boys they are violating their freedom of expression. But worse, they are not being educational, they’re being unintellectual.” Ndlozi says that if the school doesn’t withdraw its disciplinary plans, it will face mass action. The KZN Education Department has also condemned the school’s decision and says it will investigate allegations of racism at the school. It has also emerged that one of the pupils in the image was recently allegedly called the k-word by a deputy head-boy at the school.
