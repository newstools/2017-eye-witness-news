                                         JOHANNESBURG - Kenyan police say a 12-year-old boy and three other people were shot and wounded in a western county when police opened fire to disperse violent protests by opposition supporters. A police official has told the Associated Press that the shootings occurred in the Migori County and that unrest continues. Only a third of registered voters cast a ballot in Kenya's presidential election re-run on Thursday. The 33% turnout was considerably lower than at the initial poll held in August when almost 80% of the 19.6 million registered voters took part. Kenya's highest court nullified the first election, won by incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta, over irregularities raised by veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, paving the way for this week's vote. In a surprise move, Odinga quit the race earlier this month after his demands for procedural reform were not met. Meanwhile, Kenya's election commission is asking Kenyans to be calm and patient while it counts and verifies results from Thursday’s repeat presidential election. Commission Chief Wafula Chebukati says he understands the fatigue that many Kenyans feel over the political uncertainty that has swept east Africa’s economic hub. The main opposition group boycotted the election. In some areas, opposition supporters have fought police in clashes that turned deadly. At the same time, Kenya's main opposition party has accused the government of using the presidential election re-run to commit genocide. This comes after 11 people were allegedly killed on Thursday while a group of local observers say that 170 people have been killed in clashes with police since the presidential elections in August were voided.
