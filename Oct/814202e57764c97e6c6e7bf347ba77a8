                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) is calling for the Eskom board to be dissolved and for Johnny Dladla to be reinstated as acting chief executive. On Friday, the utility appointed its chief information officer and group executive for information technology Sean Maritz  as its interim CEO with immediate effect. He replaces Dladla after just four months in the job. ANCYL spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize says the Eskom board needs some fixing. “And an interim board must be placed to fix that institution, which is becoming engulfed with elements that are worrisome.” He says the removal of Dladla is suspicious. “They appoint an acting CEO. Four months into office that acting CEO is subsequently removed. To us, that signals problems.” The league has called on Parliament to immediately institute an ad hoc committee to investigate Eskom.
