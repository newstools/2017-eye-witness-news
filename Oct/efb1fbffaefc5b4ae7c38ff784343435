                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Human Rights Commission says that it will be facilitating a meeting on Thursday between Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and the African Diaspora Forum to address a complaint its received about the mayor’s comments relating to foreign nationals. The commission says that they hope to find a lasting solution between the mayor and various NGOs.  Mashaba has been quoted as saying that his department will only build housing for South Africans.  But various NGOs, including the Socio-Economic Rights Institute (Seri), has argued that the mayor's approach to clean up the city is futile as it doesn’t deal with systemic inequality. Seri’s Alana Potter says: “It’s up to us to say not on my watch. It’s up to us how we treat foreign migrants, it’s up to us about the decisions we make in our work and in our lives about how we support the human rights of everybody.”
