It’s understood the crèche was flooded as a result of Tuesday's massive thunderstorms. ER24's Ineke van Huyssteen says the search for the child has been postponed for now. “It is believed that a crèche was filled with water, some of the locals tried to assist and three out of the four kids were taken to safety. It is believed that one of the children was swept down into the river.” The death toll from Tuesday's heavy rains has risen to at least three. Among those killed are an eight-year-girl who was struck by lightning and a motorist who was crushed by a shipping container.
