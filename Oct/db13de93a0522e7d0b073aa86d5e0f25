JOHANNESBURG - As the unemployment stats remain unchanged, Lanseria International Airport has launched a five-year billion-rand investment aimed at upgrading the airport and creating jobs. Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Transport MEC Ismael Vadi say they are marking the end of transport month by launching the airport’s new fire station and tower. The newly-built tower has state of the art technology and is expected to alleviate airport traffic congestion. Makhura says he is excited that the private sector’s R1.2 billion investment will help create employment in the area. “There’s still 33,000 people employed in mining in the West Rand but every time there are reports of job losses in mining; the question is, are we creating an alternative in the economy?” Lanseria International Airport CEO Rampa Rammopo says this five-year expansion not only includes construction work but also opportunities for the youth in aviation. “It comes with more jobs both temporary and permanent.” Makhura and Rammopo say the investment will boost the local economy.
