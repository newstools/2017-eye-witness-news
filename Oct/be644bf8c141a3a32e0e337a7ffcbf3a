                                         CAPE TOWN - High absenteeism and substance abuse among rail workers as well as vandalism have been flagged as serious issues jeopardising Cape Town's train services. The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) says its lawyers are looking into allegations made in an internal letter about failing security systems affecting its network in the city. A letter from Prasa's regional security manager Ernest Hendricks to fellow executive Tiro Holele raises these concerns, among others, which have cost the company more than R100 million. In the letter, Hendricks states that the majority of the losses occurred on the central line which runs along Nyanga, Bonteheuwel and Bishop Lavis. He also claims management failed to meet targets to correct the issues. Prasa's Nana Zenani said: “We have to investigate. That will take time because of the nature of questions that we have received for the issues that they’ve raised. Unfortunately, I have not been privy to the letter nor have our legal team at this stage.”
