                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has confirmed that it's already completed an initial probe to assess the scope of its investigation into alleged maladministration and malpractice at Eskom. Eyewitness News reported on Friday that the investigation hasn't yet been approved by the president but the SIU now says the proclamation process is being followed. Eskom's CFO Anoj Singh has been suspended and several others implicated in the utility's dealings with Gupta-linked company Trillian. In order for the SIU to start a probe, it's required to obtain a proclamation from the president authorising the unit to go ahead with the full probe. At this point, the SIU's Azreen Pandor says they've met with the Public Enterprises Department and now have all the documentation. “To assess the documentation that will assist in drafting the motivation for the proclamation. This has already been done and the motivation for the proclamation has been submitted to the Department of justice and thereafter it will be forwarded to the Presidency.” At the same time, Minister Lynne Brown is still due to comment on the details of Eskom’s internal report about its dealings with Trillian. Singh and at least three others have been seriously implicated by ignoring advice four times about entering into the controversial contract with McKinsey and paying Trillian directly.
