                                         JOHANNESBURG – Eyewitness News understands that psychologists and owners of some of the NGOs that housed Esidimeni patients will testify in the arbitration process this week.  A total of 1,712 psychiatric patients were moved to 27 NGOs after the Gauteng Health Department terminated its contract with the Life Esidimeni group last year.  One hundred and forty-one of these patients died, while 59 are still unaccounted for and seven are still in state mortuaries unidentified.  Shocking details have been revealed about the conditions of NGOs where Life Esidimeni patients were moved and this week, the accounts of the owners of these NGOs are expected to be heard.  On week one of the arbitration process, the Health Ministry’s Director-General Precious Matsoso spoke about how one of the NGOs happened to be a mortuary and another a horse stable.  A Section 27 lawyer, who represents the families of 55 mentally ill people who died, then revealed that in some cases the owner of one of the NGOs signed death certificates posing as a family member.  When he released his damning report into the Esidimeni deaths, Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba said that all 27 NGOs were operating unlawfully.  Last week, the Gauteng Health Department official who headed the Esidimeni project, then revealed that the NGOs were given licenses that were signed by a health official who was not authorised to do so.
