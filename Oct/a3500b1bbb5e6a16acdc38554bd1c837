                                         CAPE TOWN - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has been accused of lying to Parliament about its negotiations with the SA Post Office (Sapo) for the takeover of social grant payments. Interim chief executive Pearl Bengu told a joint meeting of two Parliamentary committees on Tuesday night, that the Post Office is not able to meet all its requirements. But Members of Parliament (MPs) were sceptical, saying that it appeared that Sassa has not been negotiating in good faith.  Bengu says that the Post Office can only provide one out of the four services it requires. But the Democratic Alliance’s Tim Brauteseth said he didn’t believe this was true. “You are misleading Parliament and we can prove it, about the abilities of Sapo, and you are doing it deliberately so you can say Sapo can’t do this, so we have to find someone else who can.” The African National Congress (ANC)'s Vincent Smith questioned why the other services had to be put out to tender. “It’s mind boggling that the state can’t provide and this very state goes and sources it outside. It just can’t be correct.”  It’s understood that the Post Office is only prepared to accept Sassa’s offer if it is also allowed to produce the banking cards.
