                                         CAPE TOWN – Housing MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela says changes to the Western Cape Housing Amendment Act will make it easier for his department to acquire land to buy houses. It’s also expected to speed up the transfer of land to municipalities for the same purpose. The amendments are currently under consideration for enactment before the end of the year. The Western Cape Housing Development Fund has been a blot on the provincial human settlements department for years. It’s received qualified audit opinions and disclaimers for not being able to verify the extent and ownership of the properties under its control. Madikizela says this has now been sorted out, and the fund will be scrapped. The department will now take control over all the properties. “This bill is about giving us powers to acquire land because land is central to our mandate, and this is what this is about.” Madikizela says if more effort is not put into the densification of land, there won’t be enough of it to house all those in need.
