                                         JOHANNESBURG – Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) says it will only consider lifting Eskom and Transnet’s suspension from the body when sufficient steps have been taken to deal with state capture and corruption. The organisation suspended the membership of the two state-owned companies last month. BLSA says it has met with Eskom’s new acting CEO Sean Maritz. The group’s Themba Maseko says: “We want to be satisfied that an extensive investigation is conducted and that’s why we supported a call for a judicial commission of inquiry to uncover all the rot that’s taking place.”
