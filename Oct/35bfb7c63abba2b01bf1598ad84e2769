                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former tourism minister Derek Hanekom says it’s time that the person who has been firing government officials who speak out against corruption is himself fired. The former minister was speaking at the Annual Ahmed Kathrada Foundation’s Lecture at Wits University on Saturday alongside former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. Hanekom says many have fallen within the African National Congress for doing the right thing. “Barbara Hogan said: to hell with you, I will not agree with the demands you’re making of me. And she was fired, the second person was Nhlanhla Nene who would not agree to certain things – [he was also] fired. Then came Pravin.” He Hanekom says there are however still many in the governing party holding back the advancements of state capture. “But perhaps the real message is, maybe it’s time that the one who does the firing, is fired himself.” Hanekom says societies need to know and understand the impact of corruption and state capture in their personal lives so they make informed decisions. #AKLecture Former Ministers Pravin Gordhan and Derek Hanekom at the Ahmed Kathrada annual lecture at Wits University.
