                                         CAPETOWN – Some economists say consumers shouldn’t be too worried about forking out extra for eggs and chicken.   There's been a significant increase in poultry prices due to the devastating avian influenza that’s hit several farms in the country.  Fifty-six cases of bird flu were reported in the Western Cape last week, six more than was recorded the previous week.  Economist Dawie Roodt says, “The good news is these price increases can be reversed quite quickly as well, so I’ll not be surprised if we see chicken prices and the eggs prices in a year’s time lower than what they are today.”
