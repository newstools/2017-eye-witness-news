                                         CAPE TOWN – Staff at the Manenberg Clinic have been left traumatised after stray bullets hit the facility in a shooting. No one was injured in Tuesday’s shooting. Earlier this week, a man died after he was caught in gang crossfire while on his way to the clinic. The City of Cape Town’s Siyabulela Mamkeli said: “Similar to those previous incidences, I commend the braveness of the staff, actually, that they have continued to offer their services even under the trying circumstances.  “And I can tell you, it is the very first time hearing them that they have been traumatised.”
