                                         CAPE TOWN - The defence for alleged wife killer Christopher Panayiotou has started arguing why he should not be convicted. The Port Elizabeth businessman is accused of hiring men to murder Jayde Panayiotou in April 2015.  He’s standing trial with Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko, while the alleged triggerman, Sizwezakhe Vumazonke, died awaiting trial and the suspected middleman, Luthando Siyoni, turned State witness. Defence Advocate Terry Price says there are aspects of the State’s closing argument that are inaccurate. Price has bashed the prosecution’s claims that Christopher Panayiotou acquired a second phone for the sole purpose of making contact with Siyoni. He says the argument that Siyoni wanted to turn State witness is untrue adding that, at one point, the former bouncer wanted to be an accused in the matter. The defence has also found fault with the testimony of Jayde Panayiotou’s sister, Toni Inggs, who told the court the Panayiotous were unhappily married. Price says social media shows otherwise as the deceased’s Instagram account indicates they were in love. The advocate says there’s also no evidence to support claims that his client spent little time with his wife, accusing Inggs of having thumb sucked her testimony. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
