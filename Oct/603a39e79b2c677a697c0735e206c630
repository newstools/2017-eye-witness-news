                                         JOHANNESBURG - Lobby group AfriForum and model Gabriella Engels will on Friday morning find out if Zimbabwe’s first lady Grace Mugabe will be added to their court application for a review of government's decision to grant her diplomatic immunity following accusations of assault against her. Mugabe has denied claims that she attacked Engels with an extension cable in a Sandton hotel room in August. AfriForum later brought an application to the North Gauteng High Court against International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane for allowing the first lady to leave the country without being prosecuted. AfriForum’s Willie Spies said: “Either way the matter will be heard and we are meeting the Deputy Judge President this coming week to determine preferential dates to have the review application heard. It will either be with Grace Mugabe as a party or without.” In terms of the law, because Mugabe is a foreigner, the applicant must ask the High Court to add her as a respondent.
