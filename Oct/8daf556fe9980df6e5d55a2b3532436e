                                         JOHANNESBURG – Questions are now being asked about Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown following newspaper reports that two people close to her allegedly scored lucrative oil tenders from Eskom despite not having any expertise in the industry. The Sunday Times reported that the minister’s romantic partner Ingrid Tufvesson, who owns E-Smart Solutions, received two contracts from the power utility this year worth R1.2 million. Brown’s Director-General and her former PA have also been linked to the controversial Gupta family. The Public Enterprises Minister has repeatedly stated that she has no links to the Guptas but leaked e-mails have identified three people who are close to her that do have ties to the Gupta family. The paper says that one of them is Tufvesson, although the minister says she doesn’t have a partner. However, it’s now emerged that Tufvesson scored R1.2 million contracts to supply oil to Eskom at a time when Matshela Koko was appointed acting CEO at the power utility. Tufvesson has denied earning any money from the contracts and says that she has resigned from the company. The minister has been accused of protecting Koko who was recently suspended and is due to a face disciplinary hearing on Monday morning for awarding a contract to his stepdaughter.
