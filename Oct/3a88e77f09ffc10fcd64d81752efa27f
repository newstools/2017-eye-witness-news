                                         CAPE TOWN - University of Cape Town (UCT) management says that all classes and exams will go ahead as usual on Wednesday. A group of protesting students is demanding for the campus to be shut down. Some students reportedly plan to march on Parliament. They are insisting that the president immediately releases the fees commission report. UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola says that claims the university will be shut are false. “The social media claims that the UCT executive has agreed to shut down the university today is inaccurate. The executive has noted students’ call for the march today, for all students to take part in the march today, but we will not shut down the university.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
