                                         JOHANNESBURG - The family of the man accused of sexually assaulting more than 80 girls at a Soweto primary  school have told Eyewitness News he's not only brought shame on his relatives, but on the entire community. The 57-year-old school guard was arrested earlier this week. The Gauteng Education Department has confirmed 44 cases have been opened against the father of four daughters. The visibly distraught brother of the man accused of sexually abusing children at the Orlando East Primary School has told Eyewitness News he wasn't surprised by his arrest. “What he has done is not right. It’s terrible. He has disappointed us and the entire Orlando community.” He described his brother as a violent man who’s emotionally detached from the family. “Because he’s a person that loves fighting, I thought he was involved in a fight with someone while gardening and the person laid a complaint with the police.” Meanwhile, social workers have had their hands full at the school counselling children who are believed to have been subjected to the abuse for months. However, the neighbours of the accused say they're shocked, describing him as a good man and a community leader. Those who live close to the school guard described him as a friendly neighbour who loved to do his gardening. One neighbour says he's known him for 28 years. “So, on Sunday morning I was with him, talking about our children. My son usually loves to play with his children” A woman says she's shocked as the 57-year-old man would regularly interact with her young daughter. “When I hear this thing, I was shocked because he would even call my daughter and say ‘come and take ice or stock sweet’.
