                                         JOHANNESBURG – Eskom’s disciplinary hearing into suspended executive Matshela Koko has been delayed until further notice. The power utility has fired its lawyer Sebetja Matsaung following an altercation with a journalist.  Matsaung lost his temper and threatened to assault the deputy editor of the Financial Mail Sikonathi Mantshanstha for his reporting on Eskom after proceedings into the hearing were adjourned on Friday. Eskom has condemned his actions and says it hopes to have a new evidence leader before the end of this week. The power utility spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says, “We’re hopeful that at least this will happen next week still, so hopefully by Wednesday we should be having a clearer picture as to when and what time these investigations can continue.”  Koko is charged with failure to declare accurately and in a timely manner that his stepdaughter, Koketso Choma, was a director of and had a financial interest in a company that was doing business with Eskom Generation at a time when Koko was head of generation and subsequently acting CEO at Eskom. The company, Impulse International, established in 2006, is said to have received contracts from Eskom generation totalling over R1-billion while Choma was a director and beneficial shareholder of Impulse International. At the commencement of the disciplinary hearing, Koko refuted the allegations and pleaded not guilty to all six charges of misconduct levelled against him in the charge sheet, copies of which were distributed to the media attending the hearing, together with Koko’s responding plea. The charges of misconduct levelled against Koko follow an investigation and final report, recommending disciplinary action against him. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
