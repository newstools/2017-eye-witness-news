                                         JOHANNESBURG - Burundi's withdrawal from the Rome Statute comes into effect on Friday. The move has been criticised by Amnesty International, which has accused the country of trying to evade justice by withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The human rights body says this step doesnâ€™t absolve Burundi of its obligations to end ongoing human rights violations or to address its failure to deliver justice for victims on a national level. It says even if president Pierre Nkurunziza's government will not cooperate with the court, the ICC has ways and means to investigate and prosecute crimes committed.
