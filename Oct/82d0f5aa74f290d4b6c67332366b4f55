                                         JOHANNESBURG - The founder of an NGO, where patients from Life Esidimeni lost their lives, has confirmed that she received and used money from Sassa cards belonging to patients who'd already died. Dorothy Franks ran the Anchor House NGO where five patients died between July and October last year. Franks has been testifying in the arbitration hearings in Parktown on Monday, which was established to give the families of 141 mentally ill patients who died some closure. The patients were moved to 27 unlawful NGOs after the Gauteng Health Department terminated its contract with the Life Healthcare Esidimeni group. Franks says she received grant payments for 29 patients who were getting R1,500 each per month. She says she was still receiving and using these cards even after being ordered to shut down her operations. “We did everything out of the Sassa which we couldn’t get from the department. We had a certain amount which we could use and everything else extra you can take out of that.”  There was then shock from those gathered there after Justice Dikgang Moseneke asked her about using Sassa grants meant for those who died. The hearing has adjourned and will continue next Wednesday.
