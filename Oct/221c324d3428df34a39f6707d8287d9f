Answering questions in Parliament on Thursday about whether he might be sacked, Ramaphosa, a front-runner in December’s African National Congress leadership contest, said he could not speculate on rumours. On Thursday, the Deputy President said he would serve the country and its people even if Zuma fired him. “And if the decision is to remove me, I will accept that as a decision that will have been taken by the president.” Ramaphosa did not directly address reports that Zuma intends firing him on the basis of a dodgy intelligence report, insisting he serves at the pleasure of the president. “I will continue serving the people of South Africa in one form, shape or another.” Ramaphosa’s campaigning to become president of the ANC when it elects a new leadership in December, running a close-fold contest against Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
