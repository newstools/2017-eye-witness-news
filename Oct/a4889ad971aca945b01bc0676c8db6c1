                                         CAPE TOWN - Members of Parliament (MPs) in the National Assembly are debating murders following last week’s release of the national crime statistics. They say for as long as the country’s high levels of unemployment and inequality are not overcome, the government will not be able to get a grip on the crime. The Democratic Alliance (DA)’s Zakhele Mbhele, who introduced the debate, says the government cannot continue to blame South Africa’s violent past on the growing crime rate. “The fundamental problem we face as a country in effectively tackling and reducing the murder epidemic and the criminality that feeds into it is a lack of political will within the ANC national government to do the things that are required to turn the police service around, to make it an effective crime-fighting organisation.” Chair of Parliament’s police committee, ANC’s Francois Beukmann, says domestic violence and the illegal possession of firearms are fuelling crime. “Arguments or misunderstanding and domestic violence are still major contributors to the murder statistics. In many instances, there was no intention to kill but [the killer] acted in the spur of the moment without foreseeing the outcome of their actions.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
