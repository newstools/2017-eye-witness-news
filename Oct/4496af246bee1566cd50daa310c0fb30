                                         JOHANNESBURG – After a week of global consulting firm McKinsey trying to distance itself from the Guptas and questionable contracts at Eskom, more details have emerged of kickbacks to Gupta-linked shelf companies. Amabhungane is reporting on Monday how McKinsey and Regiments Capital scored a massive consulting tender at Transnet but half of the profits were syphoned off to so-called business development partners. In 2015, Transnet awarded a R375 million consulting project to Regiments Capital and McKinsey. Regiments Capital's director Eric Wood would later join Gupta associate Salim Essa to start Trillian. Regiment’s internal document reveals that it paid over half of its contract income to facilitators, including shelf companies linked to the Gupta family and their associates. Records show that over a ten month period, it diverted 55% of its income from the deal to so-called business development partners. Company records reveal that these development partners have direct links to the Guptas.
