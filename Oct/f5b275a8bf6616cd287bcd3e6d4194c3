                                         CAPE TOWN - Obesity  is costing the economy R701 billion each year, according to the Discovery Vitality OBEcity Index for 2017. Portion control is one of the key factors when it comes to obesity in South Africa. Dietitian Vanessa McEwan says consumers live a very stressed and rushed life and often opt for ready-made meals without any portion control. She says people should buy the proper raw ingredients when cooking at home. “Portion control remains a big reason for over-eating and obviously, with the convenience, we get of being purchased, they are getting in too much-refined carbohydrates. We’re not looking at a good back-to-basics and going back to home-made cooking meals.” There are a number of health concerns linked to obesity including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and breast and colon cancer. The study was done in six major cities: Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Pretoria, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth.
