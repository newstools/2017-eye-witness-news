                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it won't let National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete off the hook so easily after Parliament's ethics committee cleared her of any wrongdoing related to the annual Speaker's Ball she hosted in February. While Mbete has argued that her office played no role in organising or paying for the event, DA chief whip John Steenhuisen believes that the committee overlooked material evidence that indicates otherwise. Mbete has told a joint ethics and members' interests committee that the event held in her name after the State of the Nation Address was privately arranged and paid for by donors. The DA now wants to know who these donors are and whether Mbete declared their sponsorship to Parliament. Steenhuisen believes that the committee turned a blind eye to emails sent from a parliamentary email address to the event organisers. It's also alleged that Mbete's daughter, who works in her office, was involved in planning the event. “The committee has, in their rush to clear the Speaker, missed some very key elements of this matter which still needs explaining.” If Parliament adopts the committee's report on the matter, the DA says that it will consider taking their decision on judicial review.
