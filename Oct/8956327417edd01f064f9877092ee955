                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Social Development Department has referred allegations of sexual abuse of a five-year-old Diep River girl to police. It’s alleged the child’s mother forced her to perform sex acts on older men for money and food. Department officials intervened after receiving a tip-off from neighbours, and have since placed the child in safe care. The department’s Sihle Ngobese said: “Our social workers have requested the Family, Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Investigations Unit within the SA Police Service to investigate allegations of child sexual abuse and exploitation. The department holds a zero-tolerance approach towards the abuse, neglect and murder of children in the province.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
