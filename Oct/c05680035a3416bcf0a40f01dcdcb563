                                         CAPE TOWN - Hundreds of learners, parents and members of civic organisations are marching to Parliament to demand safer schools. Equal Education is leading the march and being supported by the Social Justice Coalition, the Nyanga Community Policing Forum, the Professional Teachers' Organisation, South African Democratic Teachers Union and members of the movement Unite Behind. The demonstrators; comprising teachers, learners, parents and members of civic organisations will hand over a memorandum at the gates of Parliament.  Equal Education's Noncedo Madubedube said: “Today’s march is about safety in schools and safe communities. “Charged with that together is also a call for police resources and equitable police associates because we realise that going into our communities the toll of violence or criminal activities filters into schools.” Alex Matanzima, a matriculant at Thembilihle High School in Khayelitsha, is one of the hundreds of learners supporting the march. “It’s about sanitation… broken school fences. Criminals enter our schools, attack us or take away our phones.” National and provincial government officials, including the education and finance ministers, have been invited to attend, but none of them responded.
