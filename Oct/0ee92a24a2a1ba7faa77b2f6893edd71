                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) has served two traffic officers, seen in video footage showing off with several banks notes, pre-suspension letters. The two officers are seen in full uniform, with loud music playing in the background. They show off lunch packs littered with bank notes. They appear to eat the money. The EMPD says the officers have brought the department into disrepute and acted in an unprofessional manner. The department's Wilfred Kgasago says the duo will appear before a disciplinary committee on Tuesday. “They have been instructed to appear on Tuesday, so they can explain why they shouldn’t be suspended.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
