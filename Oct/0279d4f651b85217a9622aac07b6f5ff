                                         LONDON - Striker Alvaro Morata is happy at Chelsea and would be willing to sign a 10-year contract with the Premier League champions, the Spaniard said ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League clash at AS Roma. Media reports quoted Morata telling Italy’s La Gazzetta dello Sport on Monday that he was unsettled at Chelsea as he found London to be “stressful”.  “In the interview I wanted to say in the future, when I finish my career, I probably won’t live in London, but right now I‘m very happy there with my wife,” Morata told reporters.  “It’s an incredible city with many religions and many different kinds of people, I‘m really enjoying London... If Chelsea had proposed a 10-year contract I would have signed it. I‘m very happy at this club...  “If I‘m good and I improve, I could probably stay here for more than five years but I need to score many goals, otherwise Chelsea will buy another player, that’s normal.”  The former Real Madrid striker also praised manager Antonio Conte, saying that they had a good relationship that helped him improve every day.  The 25-year-old is familiar with Chelsea’s Italian opponents on Tuesday as he faced Roma on multiple occasions during his two years at Juventus and the Spain international says he is focused on getting the win.  “It’s a very important match for us and we need to give 100 per cent...It doesn’t matter if we are in Italy, London or Spain, all that matters is getting the three points.”  Chelsea, who are fourth in the league, host second-placed Manchester United on Sunday.
