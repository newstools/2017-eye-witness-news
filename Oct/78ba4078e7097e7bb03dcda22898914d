CAPE TOWN - South Africa's brightest young classical musicians are tuning up for one of the year's biggest national music competitions. Twenty-one artists between the ages of 14 and 19 have been chosen as the finalists in the 33rd National Youth Music Competition taking place in Cape Town next week. The youngsters, who are from different parts of the country and Namibia, were chosen after a series of auditions. The winner walks away with R30,000 and the chance to perform with the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra. National Youth Music Foundation chairman Michael Maas says the competition provides a platform for the young musicians, especially those from disadvantaged communities, to showcase their talent. “It really gives them the advantage of creating a future for themselves which I think is so important for our young musicians. It really opens the path for them to go many places in music and to give them the confidence and the stability to be able to do that.”
