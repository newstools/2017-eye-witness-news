                                         JOHANNESBURG - It’s been revealed at the arbitration hearing into the Esidimeni tragedy that former senior Gauteng Health officials, including the suspended head of department and director of mental health, have refused to give testimony. This information was made public on Tuesday during the hearing in Parktown.  The pair, including former provincial Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu, are vital witnesses in this case because they are behind the decision and execution of the Esidimeni project, which ultimately resulted in the deaths of 141 mentally ill people.  From the beginning of this hearing, retired deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke said that he would give all witnesses, especially government officials, a chance to appear before him willingly before they are compelled to.  Section 27 lawyer Adila Hassin then revealed Mahlangu was in fact subpoenaed on an urgent basis last Friday already. “Justice, I have been advised that the subpoena was issued on Friday and we’re waiting return of service.”  State attorney Tebogo Hutamo then said that Mahlangu’s former HOD Dr Barney Selebano and former director of mental health in the province, Makgabo Manamela, have not been cooperative. “They were not willing to actually come and appear. But we’ll take the appropriate, necessary steps should there be any resistance.”  Mahlangu resigned just before the Health Ombudsman released his report into Esidimeni, while both Selebano and Manamela have been placed on precautionary suspension.
