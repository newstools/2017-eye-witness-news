                                         VIENNA - For the first time since World War Two, a European politician with a neo-Nazi background could find himself sitting in government. Parliamentary elections in Austria kick off on Sunday with the right-wing Freedom Party slated to come second. Austrians head to the polls on Sunday in a snap election called for after the ruling coalition government collapsed. This has opened the door for a far-right wing party to potentially enter the government. Headed by a leader with a neo-Nazi background, the Freedom Party has campaigned on fears of immigration and radical Islam. Its messages echo with the electorate and if polls are correct, one in four will vote for the party. The elections are the latest test of support for right-wing populist politics in Europe. Recently, other right-wing parties in Germany and France also fared well at the polls. Not only is Austrian politics turning right; the fear is that so is Europe.
