                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town City FC skipper Robyn Johannes says there will undoubtedly be a rivalry between the two coaches when they meet in Durban for the MTN 8 Final because they are both winners. Supersport United coach Eric Tinkler left City at the end of last season after one successful year with the club, where he took them to third place and won the Telkom Knockout Challenge against the club that he now coaches. City’s new coach, the legendary Bafana Bafana player Benni McCarthy, has been keen to move on from the Tinkler era and has put his own stamp on the team’s style. Johannes, who played under both coaches gave his insight into the their mindset heading into the final. “There’s always rivalry and it’s always personal because they're both winners. Coach Eric is a winner and there’s no doubt he wants to go into this game and get one over us.” Johannes was keen to stress that the match is about the club and not anybody in particular. “We have to focus on ourselves, it’s not about the coaches, it’s not about any individual’s players - it’s about Cape Town City against Supersport. We have to make sure that we, at the end of the day, lift the cup. It doesn’t matter who is there, who is in our way. We all want to create our own history.” The Mother City club can win their second piece of silverware in only two years. Johannes says their standing in local football has changed dramatically in just over a season. “We're now labelled as a big club, we're not a small club anymore and for the club it’s amazing. When we joined, we all knew we can create our own history and this is part of it. Two finals in two years but it means nothing if you don’t win it.” The final takes place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday 14 October, kick off is at 7pm.
