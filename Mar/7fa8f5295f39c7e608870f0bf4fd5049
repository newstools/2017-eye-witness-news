The South African Social Security Agency says it failed to include information from a stakeholder when it filed the papers. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has confirmed it has withdrawn its Constitutional Court application over its contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) due to an administrative error.The confirmation comes just a day after Sassa filed the notice asking for help as it had no program in place to pay 17 million people when its contract with CPS comes to an end at the end of this month. Sassa says it failed to include information from a stakeholder when it filed the papers and subsequently withdrew the application on the same day.The agency says it will soon be resubmitting a new application.In 2014, the same court found that the contract with Cash Paymaster Services was invalid because the proper procurement process was not followed.Sassa wants to enter into an interim contract with CPS for another year.Spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi says the agency only realized the mistake after the papers were submitted on Tuesday.&quot;It's important information from our stakeholders. We had to make sure that all issues that were raised by the stakeholders are incorporated.&quot;
