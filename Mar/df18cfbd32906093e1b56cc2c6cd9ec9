Local producers are calling for higher tariffs, among other measures, to protect the industry and save jobs. CAPE TOWN - South Africa s International Trade and Administration Commission (ITAC) says the crisis in the poultry industry can t be blamed only on cheap imports.ITAC chief commissioner Siyabulela Tsengiwe was speaking at Thursday s parliamentary hearings on the state of the sector.Local producers are blaming dumping from the European Union and other countries.Along with Cosatu, they re calling for higher tariffs, among other measures, to protect the industry and save jobs.Tsengiwe says the problems in the poultry sector are deep-seated. If (in) our diagnosis of the problem, we reduce (it) to just imports and therefore dumping, we will miss the reality of the situation and our policy response will fall short. The Department of Trade and Industry is working on a range of interventions.The DTI s Garth Strachan said: Like steel, poultry is too big to fail. We ve got to work together to make sure that we don t let it fail. We can t afford to lose jobs and productive capabilities. But Strachan told the hearings that there s no quick fix to the crisis.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
