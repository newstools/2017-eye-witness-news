A Soweto mother claims her 14-year-old daughter has been sexually harassed allegedly by a 47-year-old teacher at the school. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Council for Educators (SACE) says it's disgusted to learn that yet another teacher at a high school in Lenasia, south of Johannesburg, is being accused of misconduct towards a pupil.On Monday morning, Eyewitness News reported on claims by a Soweto mother who said her 14-year-old daughter was sexually harassed, allegedly by a 47-year-old teacher at the school.The mother of the 14-year-old girl told EWN the 47-year-old educator, who doesn t teach her daughter, has been making sexual advances since last year.The SACE s Themba Ndhlovu said, We condemn, in the strongest possible terms, any teacher who sexually involves himself with a learner because we believe teachers are the parents of these learners. The Gauteng Education Department's Oupa Bodibe agrees. We encourage all teacher to desists from having any kind of sexual relationships with learners because this can lead to dismissal but it is also morally wrong. Bodibe has also confirmed that the department is investigating the latest claims and that the 14-year-old girl is receiving counselling.In January, EWN revealed a separate case at the same school. In that incident, a male teacher was found guilty of sexual misconduct after it was revealed he had had a relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the school.A fellow teacher at the school, who blew the whistle on the relationship, claimed the educator and the grade 8 pupil had been in a relationship for the past year.According to her, the 15-year-old girl's mother refused to report the matter to the police because the male teacher was allegedly buying their family groceries.
