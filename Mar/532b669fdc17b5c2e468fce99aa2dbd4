CAPE TOWN - South African scientists are waiting with great anticipation for their Nano satellite to be launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa).The first trip to the international space station was due on Tuesday but was delayed due to a hydraulic problem with the launcher.The satellite was a collaborative development by Stellenbosch University and an incubation company called CubeSpace.Twelve years of research and a further three years of development led to the creation of the 2kg shoebox size satellite.CubeSpace's Mike-Alec Kearney says the Nano satellite will be used in conjunction with other satellites. These satellites will fly in a ring around the earth and do measurements of the earth s atmosphere. There s a sensor at the front of the satellite, which measures atomic oxygen in the earth s atmosphere and builds a model of the earth s atmosphere. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
