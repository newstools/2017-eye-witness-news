It's calling for the minister's removal by 21 March.Costau's Tony Ehrenreich says they're also requesting an investigation into possible corruption by CPS. If these calls are not taken seriously, we can see an escalation of protests, with our members taking off work to put pressure on the president and the minister. A memorandum was to be handed over following the Sunday picket, but despite Cosatu's requests, there was no representative from the department to receive the document, a move Ehrenreich labelled as arrogant .(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
