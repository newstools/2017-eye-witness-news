Rain in Zimbabwe is breaking records this year and it's reported government is declaring a nationwide state of disaster. HARARE - It s being reported the Limpopo River has bursts its banks at the Beitbridge Border Post.Rain in Zimbabwe is breaking records this year and the state broadcaster says President Robert Mugabe s government is declaring a nationwide state of disaster due to the destruction.Pictures published on Facebook site crossing Beitbridge show the Limpopo as a raging torrent of brown water. For now, the water appears to be at a fairly safe distance below the level of the bridge but it will make crossing much more dangerous for border jumpers.The level of the Limpopo also rose steeply in 2013 and the border had to be temporarily closed. There s no suggestion yet that this will happen again but Zimbabwe-bound travellers need to be aware of problems on at least one major highway due to the rains.The main Bulawayo-Masvingo Road was closed to traffic on Tuesday because the Nkankenzi Bridge has collapsed.Nkankezi bridge in Insiza district was swept away following incessant rains in #Zimbabwe. pic.twitter.com/tD6LGenGL6#CitizensAlert A bridge on Nkankezi River along Mbalabala-Zvishavane Road was washed away by a deluge from a failed dam.
