Mmusi Maimane says citizens have already taken the first step towards change after voting for the DA during the 2016 election. JOHANNESBURG Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says South Africans have an opportunity to continue voting for change by casting their vote for the party come 2019.The leader of the official opposition was speaking in Atteridgeville on Saturday afternoon during the launch of the party s national tour under the banner Change 19.Maimane says citizens have already taken the first step towards change after voting for the party during last year s municipal election. The 2016 municipal elections saw a shift in the political landscape, where the African National Congress (ANC) lost three of the country s biggest metros and the formation of coalition governments.Maimane says the aim is to have South Africans continue to voting for new leadership. What we have to do is ensure now that we build the coalition of South Africans who are committed to bringing change in 2019. This coalition can be South Africans from civil society, NGOs and political business formations. He says the ANC has tried to convince citizens that it has done its best to solve the country s problems, but the ruling party is not willing to bring change in order to maintain what he says are corrupt networks.
