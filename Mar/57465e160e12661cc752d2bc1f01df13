JOHANNESBURG - The rand strengthened on Wednesday as local data supported the currency against a weakening dollar while stocks fell in line with global markets amid risk-off sentiment.The rand had firmed 0.6% to R12.60 against the dollar by 14.47 GMT, just off the 20-month high reached on Tuesday and in line with global markets that benefited from weakness in the greenback on doubts over US President Donald Trump s ability to deliver on promised spending and tax cuts. Anything bad out of the US will have a positive impact on emerging markets and especially the rand at this stage, said TreasuryOne s chief currency trader, Wichard Cilliers.The rand was further supported by the current account deficit narrowing to 1.7% of GDP - its lowest in nearly six years - towards the end of 2016 and a slowdown in annual inflation.In fixed income, government bonds also strengthened, with the yield on the 2026 benchmark down 3 basis points to 8.3%.On the bourse, the Top-40 index slipped by 1.43% to 44,856 points while the All-Share index fell 1.25% to 52,097 points. There s obviously a bit of nervousness going about still. We have been weaker right from the get go this morning. The casualties have been typically resources with notable exceptions being the likes of Harmony and Anglo Gold, said Independent Securities trader Ryan Woods.Among the biggest fallers, Kumba Iron Ore fell 5% to R201.99, BHP Billiton dropped by almost 5% to R197.96 and African Rainbow Minerals weakened by 4.3% to R94.60.The market s fall was capped by the performance of gold producers, shares of which were lifted by bullion prices that rose to a three-week peak on safe-haven buying.Sibanye Gold was up by nearly 5% at R27.99, Harmony Gold gained 5.3% to R30.60 and Gold Fields advanced by 3.4% to R45.17.
