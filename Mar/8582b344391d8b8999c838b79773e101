Metrorail says it's not yet clear whether its central line will be fully operational tomorrow. CAPE TOWN Metrorail Western Cape says it's not yet clear whether its central line will be fully operational tomorrow after some infrastructure was damaged by illegal connections.This morning, services between Nyanga and Khayelitsha were disrupted after illegal connections at Nolungile informal settlement touched the rail operator's overhead cables, shutting down power in the area.Technicians have so far been able to partially restore power to the line and Metrorail has been in talks with communities next to railways on the topic of illegal connections.The rail operator's Riana Scott says a number of factors would influence whether trains will run between Nyanga and Khayelitsha tomorrow. It is unclear and depends entirely on what response we get from the community today and whether it will be in time for our technicians to complete repairs.
