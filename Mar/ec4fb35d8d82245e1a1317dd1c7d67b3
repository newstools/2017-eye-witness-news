CAPE TOWN - The ANC is confident it can regain the control it lost to the DA in the Beaufort West Municipality following the resignation of the town mayor Djorge Malooi.Malooi stepped down last week, citing 'personal problems' as the reason for his decision.The DA and ANC both had six seats in the council before Malooi resigned.With the Karoo Democratic Force, which has one seat, the DA managed to snatch control of the municipality from the ANC.The DA's acting provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela says the party has no choice but to retain this control in the by-elections in Ward 7.&quot;We have to pull out all the stops now to make sure we retain our ward because we cannot allow that municipality to go back to the ANC.&quot;But the ANC's provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs says they are confident of winning back the ward which used to be controlled by the ANC.&quot;We are confident that we can reclaim that. The challenges of the ANC resulted in us losing that by-election. We've learned from those mistakes and we will give that community the best community candidate there.&quot;The party that wins the by-election in May will take over the troubled municipality.(Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
