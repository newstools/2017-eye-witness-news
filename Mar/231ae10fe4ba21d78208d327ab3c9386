Molefe was sworn in as a Member of Parliament (MP) after he was nominated by the North West African National Congress (ANC) to fill a vacancy in the National Assembly.Since Molefe was nominated as an ANC MP, there s been confusion over which branch he belongs to after branches in both the North West and Gauteng claimed him.#Cosatu says Molefe is yet to clear his name in state of capture report &quot;he must account on why he resigned, respond to allegations&quot;CMCosatu's General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says: The central executive committee registered its disappointment in the manner the ANC dealt with the deployment of Brian Molefe, while he s yet to clear his name in the State Capture report.
