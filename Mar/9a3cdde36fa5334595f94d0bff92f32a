Thursday&#8217;s incident occurred on the same floor where defects were seen in 2015, but not close to the X-ray department. JOHANNESBURG - Structural integrity at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg has been under scrutiny for several years, after warnings that the X-ray department on the fifth floor was at risk of a collapse. Thursday s incident occurred on the same floor, but not close to the X-ray department. In 2015, Eyewitness News (EWN) revealed that three years earlier, a report had found that the department should be evacuated as the floor could potentially give way.But that report was never acted on. When EWN visited the hospital in November 2015, the floor of the X-ray department was slightly buckled and tiles were cracked. That same month, some three years after the report was compiled by independent consultants, the province s then chief engineer described the document as alarmist.WATCH: The cracking truth: Charlotte Maxeke's X-ray dept gets inspectedTshepo Matekane insisted the problem was a localised issue, caused by the building settling in the 1980s. Matekane told EWN that while the defect in the hospital was of concern and needed to be repaired, the building showed no sign of collapse. Meanwhile, last year the Democratic Alliance warned of water leaks in the building and again questioned its structural integrity.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
