The explosions in the northeastern district of Sylhet came a day after a suicide bomber blew himself up at a security checkpoint near the country's main airport in an attack claimed by Islamic State. BEIRUT - At least six people, including two police officials, were killed and scores wounded in two bomb blasts in Bangladesh on Saturday near a militant hideout that was raided by commandos, police said.The explosions in the northeastern district of Sylhet came a day after a suicide bomber blew himself up at a security checkpoint near the country's main airport in an attack claimed by Islamic State.&quot;At least six people including two police official were killed in two explosions, one near the hideout and another in front of the building,&quot; said Sylhet police spokesman Zedan al-Musa.More than 40 people were wounded, several critically, he added. About a dozen army and police personnel were among the injured.Islamic State claimed responsibility &quot;for a bombing on Bangladeshi forces in Sylhet&quot;, the SITE monitoring service said, citing the militant group's news agency Amaq.Army commandos had stormed the hideout, which belonged to a domestic Islamist group that has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and was blamed for a cafe attack in July last year in which 22 people were killed, most of them foreigners.On Saturday, commandos rescued all 78 people trapped inside the five-storey building for more than a day in an operation that was still underway.The raid came after a string of suicide attacks on security bases this month.A forensic report confirmed that Friday's attack was a suicide blast that was the third incident involving explosives in the capital, Dhaka, in a week.Islamic State and al Qaeda have made competing claims over killings of foreigners, liberals and members of religious minorities in Bangladesh, a mostly Muslim country of 160 million people.The government has consistently ruled out the presence of such groups, blaming domestic militants instead.
