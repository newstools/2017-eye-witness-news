Cosatu&#8217;s General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says if the Cabinet reshuffle does happen and Gordhan is axed, it would be interesting to know the reasons for his ousting. JOHANNESBURG As speculation and uncertainty on Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan possible axing continues, the African National Congress (ANC) s alliance partner Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has expressed its support behind him, calling him a brave man with a nerve of steel.On Tuesday, Gordhan met with ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe shortly after arriving from London.Gordhan confirmed on Tuesday he is still the Finance Minister, at least for now.Cosatu s General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says this is what they think of Gordhan. He s a brave man who believes in his own principles. He s a man with a nerve of steel. He says if the reshuffle does happen and Gordhan is axed, it would be interesting to know the reasons for his ousting. We ll be looking forward to people who might be taken out of their ministerial positions on the basis of poor performance, we ve not seen that. So it will be interesting to see what could be the reason for these ministers if they re taken out of their positions. Cosatu has previously come out in defence of the minister amid calls for him to be fired by some structures of the ANC.STILL NO WORD ON GORDHAN S FUTUREThere s still no word from the Presidency on the future of Gordhan on Wednesday morning and still no explanation as to why he was ordered to return home from London in such a hurry.Already, several organisations have said President Jacob Zuma must not remove Gordhan from his post.Tuesday s comment by Ntshalitshali that Gordhan was a brave man and a man of steel is a strong indication that they would oppose any move against him.At the same time, the South African Communist Party (SACP) has refused to confirm what they were told in their meeting with the ANC s top leaders on Monday night but it seems they would also strongly oppose any reshuffle.The stakes here are high as the SACP has several ministers in Cabinet and they could decide to resign if Gordhan goes.But the real actors here could be deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe.Their response to any reshuffle would be key to the future of Gordhan, Zuma and the ANC.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
