The African National Congress in the North West says it has handed over issues around Brian Molefe&#8217;s membership to the national leadership. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in the North West says it has handed over issues around Brian Molefe s membership to the national leadership.This comes as FNB says it cannot confirm or deny if it has suspended one of its employees over a deposit slip linked to Molefe.Last month, ANC leaders in Madibeng produced Molefe s paid membership application forms from 2011 to 2015 as evidence that he had been a member in ward 29, while another ANC branch in Pretoria claimed him.One of the documents produced by ANC members during a media briefing showed a bank stamp, which reflected the back office, instead of a teller number. This prompted FNB to investigate Molefe s membership form.ANC North West spokesperson Dakalo Legoete says the issue is now with the party s secretary general, Gwede Mantashe.Meanwhile, the ANC says it will meet with FNB to seek clarity on its investigation into the authenticity of Molefe s membership.Molefe was recently sworn in as a Member of Parliament after the provincial party nominated him to fill a vacancy in the National Assembly.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
