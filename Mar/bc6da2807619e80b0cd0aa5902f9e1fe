It sets the scene for what we can achieve when we think out of the box. It demonstrated what could be possible elsewhere in the city when we attempt to implement Transit-Orientated Development projects in creating efficient, inclusive and sustainable community. De Lille says Paardevlei, Athlone, Phillipi as well as Bellville will be among the areas to receive similar projects. The city has a big piece of land right next to Bellville station there. Why don t we bring people closer to walk to a station or to cycle to a station? So we re also going to build density then close by Bellville station next to the transport interchange.
