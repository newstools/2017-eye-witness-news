The Democratic Alliance &amp; Economic Freedom Fighters have spoken out against President Jacob Zuma following his Cabinet reshuffle. CAPE TOWN Opposition parties are lining up to criticise President Jacob Zuma after his Cabinet reshuffle.The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has rejected Zuma s Cabinet explanation behind the shakeup.The president explained he wants to improve the efficiency of government, energising his Cabinet with more youthful appointees.The EFF s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has rejected Malusi Gigaba's appointment to head up the finance ministry. He is not only underqualified to head up our Treasury but there s essentially no distinction between him and Des Van Rooyen. In a way, this is the same thing that happened in December [2015]. Malusi Gigaba is just more famous than Des Van Rooyen. The Democratic Alliance s former Western Cape leader Patricia De Lille has described the reshuffle as &quot;total madness&quot;. Zuma is drunk with power and he is also a very vindictive person. He has never accepted that he was wrong after he fired Nhlanhla Nene as Finance Minister. He has said so several times. EFF leader Julius Malema says opposition parties will vote in support of a motion of the confidence against the president. The motion of no confidence has been put before Baleka Mbete by the DA. Once Zuma says Pravin Gordhan is gone, then the matter is going to serve before Parliament, then we re going to vote for Zuma to leave and a number of ANC members in Parliament will abstain. The red berets, along with a number of other opposition groups, are looking to the Constitutional Court to order that Zuma faces disciplinary action for breaking his oath of office.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
