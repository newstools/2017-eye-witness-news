JOHANNESBURG - Mayor Herman Mashaba says he s instructed all departments within the City of Johannesburg to employ community members directly and to stop outsourcing. Mashaba says there s a misperception among Jozi@Work employees that they ll become jobless after he discontinued their programme.The workers took to the streets on Wednesday night and vandalised the Johannesburg city centre. Mashaba says the city will now be cutting out labour brokers, freeing up more money to employ workers.Mayoral spokesperson Tony Taverna-Turisan said: There were numerous complaints from the past about how Jozi@Work was rolled out and would seem to benefit the politically connected. We re seeing many of the objections coming from ANC-connected people. We want a fair and equal basis for these opportunities within communities that need them the most.
