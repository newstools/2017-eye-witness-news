It is unclear how many people were on the bus at the time, however officials say no fatalities have been reported. Emergency services are on the scene. The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department's Edna Mamonyane says motorists heading south should avoid the M1 and use back routes instead. The M1 south has been closed and off bound, only one lane has been opened. The people that are going south have been off-ramped at Joe Slovo until the debris have been removed.
