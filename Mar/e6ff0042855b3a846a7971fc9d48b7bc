The finance minister said he would meet with members of the Black Business Council and ask them to explain why they had been attacking Treasury. JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said he would meet with members of the Black Business Council (BBC) on Friday afternoon and ask them to explain why they have been attacking Treasury.Last week, a post-budget speech meeting at Nedlac became tense when the council apparently confronted Gordhan for failing to properly outline a plan for radical economic transformation.The council, the Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) and the KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) all claim the budget did not match President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation Address.Gordhan says the Black Business Council's public attacks on the Treasury are misplaced. They have to explain to the public why they re attacking an institution which has been central to providing financial stability in our country. Gordhan says the Treasury has over the years proven its financial credibility and provided stability both in the country and globally. Which enabled us to borrow the trillion of rands which we actually owe and which has demonstrated over many years how to find money both through the tax administration system and the Treasury system. The finance minister says he wants the BBC to explain how their latest remarks do not form part of a larger political agenda.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
