From applications to the ConCourt, threats of resignations and calls for a motion of no confidence, political parties want Jacob Zuma to be called to account. CAPE TOWN/JOHANNESBURG Political parties are using all avenues available in a bid to hold the president accountable after days of political uncertainty.EFF leader Julius Malema has lodged an application in the Constitutional Court to have the Speaker of Parliament ordered to institute impeachment or disciplinary proceedings against President Jacob Zuma.The EFF says it wants Zuma to be held accountable for his conduct associated with the Nkandla scandal and also for lying to Parliament.He says his party does not want the Constitutional Court to remove the president, but is only asking it to instruct Parliament to do its job.Malema says Zuma must either be impeached or face disciplinary action.He adds his party will support the DA as it plans to bring a motion of no confidence against the president. Julius Malema files his party's application with the Constitutional Court to order the Speaker of Parliament to institute impeachment or disciplinary proceedings against President Jacob Zuma.

SACP second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila briefed the media confirming President Jacob Zuma told the party of his intention to reshuffle his Cabinet.

They will withdraw as ANC members, not purely as [SACP] party members.&quot;The party says it expects to obtain feedback from the ANC top six, which also met on Monday, to hear how they have reacted to the president's intention to make changes to Cabinet.It has also called for serious action to be taken against the president should the impact of his planned Cabinet reshuffle have an impact similar to the one following the axing of former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene in 2015.State-owned investment group the Public Investment Corporation lost nearly R100 billion within 48 hours of Zuma's firing of Nene.Mapaila says should the coming reshuffle have the similar impact, heads must roll. Any action that is taken that may lead to what we saw in 2015, serious action must be taken against those responsible.&quot;He has warned that the president must tread carefully and can't be allowed to make the same mistake.NO CONFIDENCEAt the same time, Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane says he plans to bring a motion of no confidence against the president over the finance minister debacle.Maimane says at a time when nine million South Africans are without work, Zuma continues to play 'Russian roulette' with the economy and the future of the country.Reuters is reporting that the president is considering to step down next year, at least 12 months before his term as president ends.Reuters is quoting two senior party sources as saying president Zuma may resign under a deal with opponents in his ruling party that would see Gordhan leave office now.The information has not yet been independently confirmed.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
