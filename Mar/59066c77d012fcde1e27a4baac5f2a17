The civil action group says it believes Sanral is being presumptuous about using its e-toll victory for other cases in order to retrieve funds. JOHANNESBURG - Civil action group Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it believes South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) is being presumptuous about using its e-toll victory for other cases in order to retrieve funds.A R400,000 court judgment in the roads agency's favour for non-payment of tolls may help Sanral pursue other companies and individuals who haven't coughed up for passing beneath the gantries in Gauteng.But Outa s Ben Theron says this may not be the case. We believe its hot air because what they re claiming sets the precedence for all other upcoming cases. We re not talking about the merits of the case and they re claiming that the merits of the case have now been confirmed by the court, which can t be further from the truth. When you go for a default judgement nothing of the merits gets discussed at all. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
