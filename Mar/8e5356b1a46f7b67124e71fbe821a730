There were challenges in the beginning. I can t say that nothing happened. There's definitely something wrong that happened when these cases were reported by victims. I must also admit that based on interviews with victims, some police officers didn't treat them well. Nkosi-Malobane says victims will receive proper counselling. It's very unfortunate that our victims had to experience this before getting proper service. Our police are always informed about the importance on how to handle these cases.
