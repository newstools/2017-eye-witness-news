Julia Seotladi says her pension is the only money she has to support her nine children and grandchildren. JOHANNESBURG - As grant recipients wait to see if social grants will be distributed successfully from Saturday, a pensioner in Soweto has told Eyewitness News that the recent political events around South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) have left her worried and uneasy.Julia Seotladi says her pension is the only money she has to support her nine children and grandchildren as none of them are employed.The 89-year-old says she is disheartened that government could treat social grants with such disregard, especially since elderly people have worked so hard for this country. If we don t get the money, who will? We have been working under difficult conditions our whole lives! We voted for them and they promised better lives. If they do not deliver, they will answer to God. She says life would be unbearable without her grant as she uses the money not only to take care of her family but also for funerals should anyone die. There are about 12 people in this house and nobody here has a funeral policy. With the grant money we can conduct a decent funeral if anyone dies. Sassa says beneficiaries who receive grants from ATMs will be able to get their money Saturday, however, those who utilise pay points will only receive their grants on Monday.WATCH: If I don t get my money, my children will die(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
