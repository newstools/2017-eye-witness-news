Stats SA's latest data shows price increases slowed to 6.3% in February compared to the same time last year. CAPE TOWN - Some experts anticipate the inflation rate to pull back even further during the course of 2017.Stats SA's latest data shows price increases slowed to 6.3% in February compared to the same time last year, 0.3 percentage points lower than January's figure of 6.6%.Some experts, including George Glynos, expect this trend to continue. I think that s going to be brought about by persistent strength in the rand. We ve already seen it strengthen to a 20-month high and we think that can extend quite a bit further. We don t believe the rand has run its full course yet. The food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation rate has also slowed down to 9.9% year-on-year.The Agricultural Business Chamber s Wandile Sihlobo said: This inflation could fall as low as around 6% by the end of this year. But now that we ve seen it below 10% for the first time since March 2016, we expect this trend is going to be continued throughout this year. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
