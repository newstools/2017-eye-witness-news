Noah may be the only South African to make it onto the cover of Time twice in five months but which other locals cracked the nod? Time Magazine is mostly known for its influential covers and top 100 lists, with the likes of Nelson Mandela making it on almost six covers since 1990. Daily Show host Trevor Noah is the latest South African to make it onto the international weekly, after being placed amongst some US comedy big wigs in a September cover about the seriously partisan politics of late night comedy. Noah has now been named one of Time's 'Next Generation Leaders'. Wow it looks even crazier on a news stand. Look mom, I&#39;m on the cover of Time magazine. https://t.co/7cmJpGWXIMHere is a list of the great and some of the more controversial South Africans who made it onto Time's radar. Thuli Madonsela made it on the top 100 most influential people in 2014 for her work as the country's public protector. So proud that Thuli Madonsela made the Time 100 list http://t.co/OF2t1URDOxAn August 1966 cover featured Hendrik Verwoerd a month before his assassination. Verwoerd was the Prime Minister at the time, under the apartheid regime. A striking cover image of Oscar Pistorious was published in 2013. Almost a year ago, @TIME Magazine&#39;s cover | #OscarPistorius pic.twitter.com/EaoLQMsSZBThabo Mbeki made it on the May 24 , 1999 issue when he took over the helm. Other South Africans featured in the Time magazine in a Q and A, include Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane.
