After using specialist equipment, which included sniffer dogs, drillers and shovels, Emergency Services say they are certain that all people have been accounted for.

Motsoaledi said the maintenance company should be held accountable for the roof collapsing and injuring people. Sharing his sentiments, Mamabolo said, “We don’t think there was a preliminary check of the capacity and the structure of the building to carry that weight and that is why it collapsed.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
