CAPE TOWN - Suspended African National Congress Western Cape chairperson Marius Fransman has questioned why he was ousted from the party while other leaders facing criminal charges continue to serve.Fransman has taken on ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe over the recent decision to recall Andile Lungisa, the ANC's chairperson in Nelson Mandela Bay.He's accused Mantashe of allowing the ANC's brand to sink under his watch but the top brass leader was told to &quot;go sell ice-cream&quot;.In a statement directed at Mantashe, Fransman has asked why Boland secretary Jonton Snyman and provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs have not been booted out of the party.Snyman was found guilty of fraud while Jacobs is currently facing assault charges in court. Jacobs was found guilty by the ANC's disciplinary committee but his sentence was suspended. Fransman believes the pair are still in leadership positions because they are in Mantashe's faction.Mantashe has previously rubbished Fransman's claims, saying decisions are taken by the disciplinary committee, which is an independent body.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
