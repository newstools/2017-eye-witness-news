Sassa filed heads of argument to the Constitutional Court, in response to opposing parties about the oversight role of the payment process. JOHANNESBURG The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini have proposed tight financial monitoring of an interim contract with CPS to ensure social grants are paid come the first of next month.Sassa and the minister filed heads of argument to the Constitutional Court on Monday, in response to opposing parties about the oversight role of the payment process, saying the Auditor-General and Public Protector should monitor this.However, in defiance of a court order they missed the 4pm deadline to answer pointed questions to the Constitutional Court, clarifying the payment issue and the contract with CPS.In papers filed to the Constitutional Court on Monday, Sassa and Dlamini have proposed that the Public Protector and Auditor-General should monitor the payment process and the terms and implementation of an interim contract to be signed with CPS.In response to opposing parties, however, Sassa says the Public Protector and Auditor-General should evaluate an interim contract with CPS.Because it is of the opinion that it can legally sign an emergency contract with the company, as long as the National Treasury condones it and the contract is no longer than absolutely required to ensure the payment of social grants.Sassa had previously agreed to a two-year deal with CPS, but that deal has been reportedly thrown out late last week by a ministerial task team.DOESN T WANT CONCOURT TO OVERSEE SASSA DEALDlamini says she doesn t want the Constitutional Court to oversee the Sassa deal saying the Auditor-General and Public Protector should rather monitor a new deal to pay social grants.Instead they have suggested in court papers filed in response to opposition parties that a new interim contract will be signed with CPS and that the Auditor-General and Public Protector should oversee this process.The court wants to know when Sassa knew that it wouldn t be able to take over the payment process from CPS and if any new agreement has been negotiated.It s understood that the papers in relation to Black Sash and other opposing parties were filed about the oversight role of the payment process.Mail &amp; Guardian is now reporting that Sassa wants the Public Protector and the Auditor-General to monitor the terms and implementation of the interim contract to be signed with CPS, and that the Constitutional Court itself should only see the contract it will sign with CPS 20 days after it is concluded.Constitutional Court expert Pierre de Vos says it s unclear what the ramifications will be but the answers could still be submitted. They can appear on Wednesday and say we didn t hand this in, we need more time. Then the court will decide what to do to make sure they do what they are legally obliged to do.
