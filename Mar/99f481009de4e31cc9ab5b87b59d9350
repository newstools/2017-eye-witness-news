The Senate expressed concerns that not enough is being done to protect Nigerians and their interest in South Africa. ABUJA - Nigeria's deputy President of the Senate Ike Ekweremadu has been named as the leader of a strong seven-member delegation of the Nigeria Senate to South African Parliament, to speak on the xenophobic attacks targeted at Nigerians living in South Africa. This followed a resolution by the Senate to engage the South African Parliament, expressing concerns that not enough is being done to protect Nigerians and their interest in South Africa.Nigeria Senate committee on foreign affairs led by James Manager had summoned the minister of state for foreign affairs Khadija Buka-Abba to explain what her ministry has done so far, in curbing the rising tensions between both countries. I want you to convince us, what have you been able to do to stop this trend of attacks on Nigerians by the South Africans. Some senators like Gbenga Ashafa called for some sort of diplomatic retaliation if the attacks continue. I don t see us doing anything tangible by way of arresting these attackswithout this government standing up and having some kind of diplomatic representation. But Buka-Abba is confident that a solution is in sight. We spoke with the high commissioner today and it has been confirmed that no lives have been lost.
