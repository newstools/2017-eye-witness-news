Reports have emerged that an intelligence dossier may have led to Finance Minster Pravin Gordhan being called back from an international investor roadshow. LONDON Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says South Africans should not be fed nonsense about intelligence reports and Parliament should interrogate any new claims linked to Pravin Gordhan.Maimane spoke to Eyewitness News in London, as reports emerged that an intelligence dossier may have led to Gordhan and others being called back from an investor roadshow.He also called events at Ahmed Kathrada s memorial service on Wednesday a significant political moment that exposes divisions within the ANC.Maimane says he will demand clarity. If there s an intelligence report I will ask him and challenge him to table that report at the portfolio committee on intelligence and let s interrogate it and if there s merit to it, then let s engage it. But we can t be fed this nonsense that Jacob Zuma is putting, while in fact undermining the economy of South Africa. The intelligence report allegedly claims it was in London that secret meetings were to be held to plot regime change in South Africa.Maimane says firing Gordhan would spark an economic crisis.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
