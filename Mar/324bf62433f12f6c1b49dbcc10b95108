JOHANNESBURG - The funeral of struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada on Wednesday saw politics take centre stage.Politicians, past and present, lamented how the call by African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts for self-reflection within the ANC and its leadership have been completely ignored.It started out as a tribute to &quot;Uncle Kathy&quot;, who was described as a generous and humble soul.GALLERY: Ahmed Kathrada: A life in picturesBut the service soon took a turn, with strong political messages being delivered by those who spoke. Gauteng Premier David Makhura called for ANC veterans to be respected. Let s ensure that the views and voices of our struggle veterans are heard and respected. ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize says the party must accept the advice given by Kathrada during his last days because his utterances were not personal but aimed at repairing the organisation. I think of the advice he has given, we have to accept it and move to address issues to bring back hope. Anglican archbishop Thabo Makgoba says the will of the people must be done. My observations about the messages that came out today is that citizens are speaking. Former President Kgalema Motlanthe got a standing ovation when he read out excerpts of Kathrada s letter to President Jacob Zuma, asking him to step down.&quot;Comrade Kathy continues bluntly if not arrogantly, 'In the face of such persistently widespread criticism, condemnation and demand, is it asking too much to express the hope that you will choose the correct way that is gaining momentum, to consider stepping down?'&quot;WATCH: The moment Motlanthe quoted Kathrada s letter calling on Zuma to resignFinance Minister Pravin Gordhan was also applauded for remaining true to the values &amp; principals that Kathrada stood for.WATCH: Gordhan lauded at Kathrada funeralSpeculation around major political shifts resurfaced on Monday when Gordhan was suddenly called back from an investor roadshow abroad with no explanation.It's understood the top six of the ANC are divided down the middle on whether to remove Gordhan, two sources told Reuters.President Zuma, who is part of the top six, wants to replace Gordhan and has the support of chairperson Baleka Mbete and deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte, the sources said.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe and ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize want Gordhan to remain and have expressed their opinion to Zuma, the sources said.Zuma does not need the support of the top six to hire and fire ministers but should top ANC members openly criticise his decision, it would likely weaken his position in the party.The president did not attend Kathrada's funeral in compliance with the wishes of the stalwart s family.To read Ahmed Kathrada's full open letter to President Jacob Zuma, click here.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
