Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is currently answering questions in the National Assembly. PARLIAMENT - Ramaphosa says government is working to ensure that social grants are paid out on time in April.He s been asked to weigh in on the recent controversy surrounding Sassa.The agency's contract with Cash Paymaster Services expires leaving uncertainty around the pay out of social grants next month.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has come under fire in recent weeks after officials from her department told MPs that no plan is in place to pay out grants once the current, invalid contract with Cash Paymaster Services expires at the end of March.The Democratic Alliance (DA)'s Mmusi Maimane argued that the minister should be fired. Would you support the call to say that Minister Bathabile Dlamini should in fact resign over social grant crisis? However, Ramaphosa says the matter is being dealt with in the Constitutional Court. The highest court in our land a court that s so well-endowed with wise brains and minds is going to deliberate on this matter as they did in the past. Ramaphosa went on to say that only President Jacob Zuma has the prerogative to hire or fire ministers.Members of parliament (MPs) are likely to focus their line of questioning around how the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) will pay out millions of grants to South Africans in April when the invalid contract with its service provider expires.LEARNERSHIPS FOR YOUNG PEOPLERamaphosa says government is negotiation with the private sector to take on at least one million young people in learnerships over the next three years.He says government is committed to improve the country s maths and science skills to grow the economy.Less than 25% of students enrolled for a Bachelor of Science degree, graduate.Ramaphosa says the poor pass rate in the fields of science and technology has its roots in basic education. He says government is involved in a number of initiatives to upskill the country s youth. We ll start seeing the benefit of all this in the next few years as more and more of these young people become renowned scientists, academics and professors with PhDs. PARLIAMENT GIVEN 24 MONTHS TO FIX A KEY PIECE OF LEGISLATIONEarlier, Eyewitness News reported that Parliament has been given 24 months to fix a key piece of local government legislation which the Constitutional Court says is unconstitutional and invalid.The Constitutional Court on Thursday confirmed a ruling by the Gauteng High Court to this effect, saying the act was incorrectly processed by the national legislature.However, the court suspended the declaration of invalidity for two years to allow Parliament to correct the problem.The Amendment Act came into force in 2011, aimed at curbing increasing maladministration in municipalities by insisting their managers were properly skilled and barring them from holding political office.After a challenge by the South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu), the Gauteng High Court ruled the act to be inconsistent with the constitution.The Constitutional Court has now confirmed this ruling.But to avoid disrupting the running of municipalities across the country, the court s given Parliament 24 months before the declaration of invalidity takes effect.It s also ordered Parliament to pay Samwu s legal costs.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
