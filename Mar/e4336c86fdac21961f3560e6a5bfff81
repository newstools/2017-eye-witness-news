Matthias Stirnemann from Switzerland and his fellow countryman and Cape Epic debutante Nino Schurter took the title in the men's race. CAPE TOWN - This year's Cape Epic has been labelled as one of the most competitive and grueling races of its kind.At least 1,350 cyclists navigated some of the Cape's roughest and toughest terrain in Durbanville, Hermanus, Greyton and Elgin before ending in Franschhoek.Matthias Stirnemann from Switzerland and his fellow countryman and Cape Epic debutante Nino Schurter took the title in the men's race.The woman's title went to another Swiss, Esther Suss and her teammate Jennie Stenerhag from Sweden.Mariske Strauss is the highest placed South African in the race, finishing second overall, together with her English teammate Annie Last. Race director Kevin Vermaak says it has been a tough week. The thermometers on the bikes measured about 45 C. Normally, you have about 6% or 8% of riders who were not fit enough and they were never going to finish the race and they normally get cut-off by time on Day 1. This year, those riders suffered incredibly in the heat and were going to hospitals but the hospitals were actually full. Race director Kevin Vermaak says cyclists wanting to participate must be ready to register later on Monday and then the training starts.&quot;Every rider that I've spoken to, that's crossed the line, says that they're just so happy and exhilarated with their achievement. All of them say that they've done the training and enjoyed the event because of the amount of training they've done beforehand and with entering a year in advance, you've got a lot of time to go and do the training properly.&quot;Are you ready for Stage 3? Here&#39;s what&#39;s coming your way, but in the #Untamed everything can change in an instant. pic.twitter.com/9KRdBwtyRULeading ladies. @CapeEpic pic.twitter.com/JIV5xqg46cWhat a team! @sibueverest @ultrabloke at end of @CapeEpic #legends pic.twitter.com/t5RoGYSAPH(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
