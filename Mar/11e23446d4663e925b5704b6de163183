The minister &amp; Sassa missed a 4pm deadline to answer the court's questions about the controversial contract . JOHANNESBURG Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini says she doesn't want the Constitutional Court to oversee a new social grants payment deal, adding she rather wants the Auditor-General (AG) and Public Protector to monitor a new deal.On Monday, Dlamini and South Africa Social Security Agency missed a 4pm deadline to answer the court's questions about the controversial contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) that it had declared invalid in 2014.Instead, they have suggested in court papers filed in response to opposition parties that a new interim contract will be signed with CPS and that the Auditor-General and Public Protector should oversee this process.Sassa says the Public Protector and AG should evaluate an interim contract with CPS because it is of the opinion that it can legally sign an emergency contract with the company, as long as Treasury condones it and the contract is no longer than absolutely required to ensure the payment of social grants.Sassa doesn't want the court to be part of the new negotiations because it does not have all the pertinent information before it. However, the agency concedes that negotiations may not lead to a new contract.The department will be in court on Wednesday arguing these issues and will have to explain why the court's questions were not answered.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
