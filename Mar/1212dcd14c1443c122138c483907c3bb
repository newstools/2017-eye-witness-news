The court has heard that a teacher who is being investigated for allegedly sexually assaulting a pupil was previously accused of rape in 2007. JOHANNESBURG It s emerged in the Protea Magistrates Court that a Lenasia teacher accused of sexual assault was accused of rape back in 2007.Eyewitness News revealed last week that the teacher was being investigated by the Gauteng Education Department, after a teenager's mother reported the crime to authorities.The teacher has since resigned from his post at the school.The State has opposed bail, saying investigations show that the 47-year-old teacher had sexually harassed the 14-year-old pupil numerous times before. The State has also revealed that he has a rape case dating back ten years ago. No other details regarding the 2007 case were revealed on Monday, but the man is expected back in the dock on Tuesday for a formal bail application. His lawyer has argued that the current case is speculative and is a schedule one offence, but the state prosecutor has told the court - that the educator should be kept in jail given that this is not the first time charges have been laid against him.As this was being discussed the accused, dressed in black jeans and a khaki jacket, looked back at his family sitting in the public gallery and shrugged his shoulders. The group, three women and two men walked out of court and complained about him being kept behind bars.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
