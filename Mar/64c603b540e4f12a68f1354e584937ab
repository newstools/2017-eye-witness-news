Tuesday Sassa asked that same court to extend the contract for a year, but just hours later withdrew the request. JOHANNESBURG The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) insists there is nothing sinister about its decision to withdraw its 11th hour Constitutional Court application.Officials from the agency sent shock waves through the country on Tuesday when they told Parliament that no plan is in place to pay grants to 17 million South Africans when its contract with Cash Paymaster Services expires at the end of this month. In 2014, the Constitutional Court found that the contract with the service provider was invalid, because proper procurement processes were not followed. Tuesday agency asked that same court to extend the contract for a year, but just hours later withdrew the request.Sassa says it made an honest error by submitting court papers over the deal.Spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi says: We did realise that there was an error, but it was a tedious process that we had to follow if we want to withdraw and want to resubmit. But you can rest assured that there is nothing sinister. It was just an honest error. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
