PRETORIA - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan says the question of value for money is among the factors Treasury will consider when deciding on how to fund free higher education. The minister and a delegation from Treasury made submissions to the Fees Commission in Centurion on Friday.President Jacob Zuma set up the commission last year to investigate the feasibility of free tertiary education.Gordhan says across government, they must consider what impact is being made with the money being spent and whether it has value. And that applies to higher education as well, the 15% pass rate or there above, what are we investing? With the drop-out rate among first years the way it is, what are we investing and what impact are we making? I m hoping the commission is looking into those issues as well, otherwise it becomes a bottomless pit. Gordhan s presentation focused on showing the commission the constraints Treasury is facing, with limited economic growth and increasing demands on the fiscus.The challenge is to find a sustainable funding model.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
