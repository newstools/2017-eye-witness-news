CSA want to appoint the coach to take the helm after the tour to the UK until the 2019 World Cup.Nenzani says they will still need to appoint a committee which will oversee the recruitment process. The applications have not yet opened because the committee has not been put in place and there is no process that has started. So there is no discussion on who has applied and who is going to apply. Nenzani says there is no timeline as to when the committee will be chosen but says it is a priority.&quot;As soon as possible, I don t want to give you a deadline because we need to talk to people. They need to agree, you need to put in place terms of reference, you need to discuss with them how this thing needs to be done, so that when they start, you won t have any hiccups.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
