The research report focuses on students involved in the Fees Must Fall movement, how it developed and provides recommendations to university management on how to deal with the matter. JOHANNESBURG Research conducted into the Fees Must Fall student movement has found that the issues of decolonisation and transformation were central themes promoted by those involved in the protests.The research report focuses on students involved in the movement, how it developed and provides recommendations to university management on how to deal with the matter. The Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation has launched a report at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg. The report is titled Hashtag an analysis of the Fees Must Fall Movement at South African Universities . Research editor and senior lecturer at Wits University Malose Langa says they compiled the report because bringing police onto campuses during protests did not work. In all of them, there is no evidence that police were brought and then there was peace and order. In all of them, when police were brought in all hell broke loose. He says the research is also critical of student behaviour. Divisions within student leadership, in a way, weakens their case. Langa says credit should be given to the movement for accelerating the changes in higher learning institutions.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
