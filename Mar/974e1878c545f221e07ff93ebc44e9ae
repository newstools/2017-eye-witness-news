The Johannesburg Metro Police Department says the child was swept away by the strong current on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG – A seven-year-old boy is still missing after being swept away during flash floods in Soweto. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) says the child was swept away by the strong current just off Elias Motsoaledi Road. Several roads were flooded, including Gillooly’s Interchange, as well as parts of the East Rand after Thursday's rain. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minaar says, “The search will resume on Friday morning because the child was not found on Thursday."   Johannesburg Emergency Services say the missing seven-year-old fell into a storm water drain in Dobsonville while playing outdoors during Thursday's heavy rains. Emergency Services member Nana Radebe says, “Parents must be very careful and teach their kids about storm water drains, they’re very dangerous. And to make sure that after it rains or when it rains kids don’t walk or play outside or around these areas.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
