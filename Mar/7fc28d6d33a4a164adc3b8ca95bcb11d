The Social Development Minister says her attorneys filed her affidavit to the Constitutional Court electronically before the 4pm deadline. JOHANNESBURG - Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has confirmed that her attorneys filed her affidavit to the Constitutional Court - electronically - before the 4pm deadline.However, Eyewitness News can confirm that by 4:15pm the court had closed its doors and the affidavit had not been delivered by hand or by email.Dlamini was ordered to explain why she shouldn't be held personally liable and pay costs from her own pocket for the Sassa payment crisis.Her attorneys say they did file her affidavit on time, explaining that the 140-page document was served electronically before 4pm.Twenty-six copies of the same document had to be hand delivered so as to be filed in court but the minister's legal team says the court could not accept the filing without confirmation of the electronic service.In the statement Dlamini explains that unfortunately due to the large size of the file some of the electronic service bounced back and all parties could not be served before 4pm.The attorneys will make a condonation application to the court on Monday.In her affidavit the minister claims here was no willful intention to disregard the 2014 order to acquire a new service provider for the payment of social grants.Dlamini also says around 650,000 beneficiaries have already withdrawn their social grants on Friday and she'll be monitoring the payment process on Saturday.
