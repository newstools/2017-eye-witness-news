Dressed in a dark suit and red tie, Shakes Mashaba seemed relaxed during his hearing at the CCMA offices on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG The drama at the South African Football Association (Safa) shows no signs of ending yet as the sporting body remains without a Bafana Bafana head coach and former boss Shakes Mashaba seems no closer to a verdict in his ongoing arbitration hearing at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).Mashaba was dismissed in December last year after being found guilty of gross misconduct at a disciplinary hearing following a public outburst which was caught on national TV.Dressed in a dark suit and red tie, Mashaba seemed relaxed during his hearing at the CCMA offices on Thursday.The hearing was meant to wrap up on Thursday, but has dragged into a fourth day as Mashaba continues to fight either for compensation or full reinstatement as Bafana boss.At the same time as he appeared on Thursday, his former assistant Owen Da Gama announced the squad for two friendlies later this month as Safa continues to delay the naming of Mashaba s replacement.For now that appointment seems no closer as some of the potential candidates have confirmed to EWN Sport that little, if any, contact has been made by the association over the post.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
