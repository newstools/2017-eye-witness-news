JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng Transport MEC Ishmael Vadi says stronger action needs to be taken against taxi drivers found to be transgressing the law as they are responsible for the lives of thousands of South Africans daily. Vadi was reacting to an accident on the R82 in Walkerville on Thursday in which nine people died when a taxi overturned. The MEC says if it is found that the taxi was indeed overloaded at the time of the crash, the driver will face the full might of the law. “There will be a formal accident investigation that will be done by the Gauteng traffic police and if there were any breaches of the regulations, I’m sure the law will take its course.” He says further steps need to be taken by passengers and law enforcement agents to show taxi drivers the seriousness of the issue. The cause of the crash has still not been determined however, the department says a thorough investigation will be carried out to determine it. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
