PARLIAMENT - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the ministers of justice, state security and police should urgently appear before Parliament's Justice Committee to discuss the break-in at the office of the chief justice.Thieves broke into the Midrand offices on Saturday morning and stole 15 computers containing sensitive information, including the personal details of the country s judges.Earlier on Wednesday, Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane announced the arrest of three suspects.The lieutenant-general named Nkosinathi Msimango as someone who may have critical information required to solve the crime.DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach says all three ministers have questions to answer. What is justice doing, what is the NPA doing, what are the police doing and more importantly, how is it that we don't have intelligence about this kind of thing?&quot;Breytenbach says it's clear it was no ordinary burglary. It not something that your common or garden variety of crook wakes up one morning and decides to do. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng was to have appeared before Parliament's Justice Committee on Thursday to brief MPs on his office's annual performance plan and budget.But that meeting was on Wednesday postponed, with committee chair Mathole Motshekga saying in a statement that it was deferred at Mogoeng's own request, due to the break-in at the office of the chief justice at the weekend.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
