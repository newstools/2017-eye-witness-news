But the foundation says the speakers at the service in Johannesburg on Wednesday will only be from the foundation itself.CEO Neeshan Balton says the service is open for anybody to attend, including the president.He says the African National Congress (ANC) and its alliance partners have been asked to forward their messages. Tomorrow s programme is hosted by the Kathrada Foundation, the speakers are from the foundation and it is open to everybody in the country to attend and whether people attend it is up to them. Balton says there will be a national memorial service later this week planned in conjunction with the Presidency and that is where those from outside the foundation may address the proceedings. And that is being done with the Presidency and they will determine who speaks on behalf of government there. #ripahmedkathrada From meeting political leaders Yasser Arafat & Barack Obama, to attending children's charity events, #ewn takes a look, in pictures, at the life of #strugglestalwart Ahmed #kathrada who passed away this morning. : AFP & EWN.A post shared by Eyewitness News (@ewnupdates) on Mar 27, 2017 at 11:43pm PDT(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
