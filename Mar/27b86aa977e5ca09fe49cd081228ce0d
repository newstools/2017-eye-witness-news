Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google have now set up a joint data-base to track and remove terrorist content.CNN s Samuel Burke reported that: Any social network, if they see a picture or a video that they deem to be terrorist content or extremist content, all they have to do is to label it once and automatically the other social media companies that are participating in this will see that and can bring down this content automatically. So, the second it is tried or attempted to be published, it will come down before anyone sees it. It is something that they should have done many years ago.
