The forum says it rejects a statement by the DA claiming that R840,000 was paid to the organisation to wage a &#8216;dirty war&#8217; against the Treasury. ILLOVO - The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) says it rejects with contempt a statement by the Democratic Alliance (DA) claiming that R840,000 was paid to the organisation by Transnet and Eskom to wage a 'dirty war' against the Treasury.The PPF held a briefing on Thursday, insisting the payments formed part of a sponsorship for programmes it offers. The organisation says if raising pertinent issues about what the Treasury does means it s engaged in a so-called dirty war then so be it because the forum remains firm on issues of transformation.The PPF says just like any other non-profit organisation, it seeks financial assistance in the form of sponsorship in order to run its programmes.Deputy President Kashif Wicomb says: What makes the DA story shameful, hopeless, lame and malicious is that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, the same minister the DA is purporting the PPF is fighting, using all forms of lies and deceit possible, was one of the panel speakers. Kashif says the DA statement is another desperate and racially based attack on an organisation fighting against white monopoly capital.The PFF has also called on the DA to reveal the nefarious agenda of those who sponsor them.The fact is that Jimmy Manyi &amp; his Progressive Professionals Forum should not have received one cent from Eskom or Transnet. - @DavidMaynier(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
