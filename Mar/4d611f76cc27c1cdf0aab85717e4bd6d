The AA says the increase in global oil stocks and stronger rand have lead to the predicted price drop. JOHANNESBURG - Good news for motorists planning holiday trips this Easter, a decrease in the fuel price seems to be on the cards.That is according to the Automobile Association (AA). The body says the increase in global oil stocks and the stronger rand have lead to the predicted price drop announcement on the first of next month.The AA s Leyton Beard says this comes despite an increase in both the fuel levy and contribution to the Road Accident Fund which kicks in this month. The AA is predicting a decrease of around 24 cents a litre for petrol, which includes that 39 cents. So that s really is good news. Obviously, it would have been more had it not been for that 39 cents increase to the tax, but I think at this stage, motorists will take a decrease of any kind. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
