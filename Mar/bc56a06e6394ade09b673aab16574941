The call comes after the bodies of 14 suspected illegal miners were discovered on the East Rand earlier this week. JOHANNESBURG Oxfam South Africa has called on government to regulate informal mining.This comes after the bodies of 14 suspected illegal miners were discovered on the East Rand earlier this week.The organisation says it believes the deaths were avoidable and are a symptom of much problems faced by communities living alongside abandoned mines.The organisation s spokesperson Isaac Mangena says Oxfam believes the problem of unregulated mining is compounded by the lack of proper research on artisanal mining in the country. We call on the South African government to decriminalise informal mining and for the sector, which is worth billions of rand, to be properly regulated and licensed as envisaged by the African mining vision. Mangena says government should acknowledge the role of informal mining in micro-economic development, household income creation and in securing the livelihood of the majority of the poor.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
