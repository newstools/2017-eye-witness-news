CAPE TOWN The latest growth domestic product (GDP) figures from Stats South Africa (Stats SA) show that South Africa s economy has continued with its downward growth trajectory for the third consecutive year. The GDP estimates released in Pretoria on Tuesday show that the economy grew by a meagre 0.3% last year.The mining and agriculture sectors of the economy contributed significantly to the contraction over the period. In 2013, the economy experienced growth of 2.5%. That figure slumped to 1.7% the following year, to 1.3% in 2015 and now to just 0.3% last year. Stats SA s Michael Manamela says signs of problems started as far back as seven years ago. If one traces the growth from 2010, we have really not had an upward trajectory. I think the trajectory had been a downward one, and what we see in 2016 is that the trajectory of declining growth is continuing. Last year the mining sector contracted by 4.7% while agriculture was down by 7.8%.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
