Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says the decision has been based on the balance of available scientific information. CAPE TOWN - Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has announced that fracking will go ahead in the Karoo.This is despite the findings of a report by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in November that there's not enough water to support hydraulic fracturing.But Zwane says the decision has been based on the balance of available scientific information.Zwane says comprehensive measures have been taken to alleviate any risks associated with shale gas development.This includes the publication of Regulations for Petroleum Exploration and Production and the Karoo Deep Drilling study being undertaken by the Council of Geoscience.He says the finalisation of amendments to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act will help expedite the development of shale gas exploration.Zwane has told the Richmond community the move will create jobs and boost the Northern Cape economy.The CSIR's report, however, has found that the promise of thousands of jobs is exaggerated.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
