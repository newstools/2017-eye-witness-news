It has to be good reason, that s why we re waiting with eagerness to find out. Gordhan and Treasury Directory-General Lungisa Fuzile have both confirmed they still don t know why they were instructed to come back home with immediate effect.Meanwhile, Cosatu has expressed its support f or Gordhan, calling him a brave man with a nerve of steel.Gordhan confirmed on Tuesday he is still the Finance Minister, at least for now.Ntshalintshali says this is what they think of Gordhan. He s a brave man who believes in his own principles. He s a man with a nerve of steel. He says if the reshuffle does happen and Gordhan is axed, it would be interesting to know the reasons for his ousting. We ll be looking forward to people who might be taken out of their ministerial positions on the basis of poor performance, we ve not seen that.
