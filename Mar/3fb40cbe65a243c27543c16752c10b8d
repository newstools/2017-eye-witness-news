Nobody can take blame for this, we were all in good spirits about doing it so I don t think we can apportion blame. The reality of the situation is that budget vote of our minister for finance doesn t look good, so we were going to take money from here and there. COMMONWEALTH GAMES CERTAINLY MOVING ON The Commonwealth Games Federation has confirmed that it is looking to replace Durban as host of the 2022 event.
