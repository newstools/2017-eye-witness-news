FNB STADIUM Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates played out to yet another draw in the Soweto Derby as it ended 1-1 at FNB Stadium.Joseph Molangoane opened the scoring for Chiefs and then almost 15 minutes later an own goal from Itumeleng Khune, created by Thembinkosi Lorch gave Pirates the 1 point.Chiefs coach Steve Komphela says the result is disappointing. You feel disappointed based on what transpired, it s a big match so it wasn t going to be easy. This is a game of small margins and we didn t come to the party. Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret says his boys were impressive in the first half. I thought we played really good football for the first half, we created five good chances. When they scored it was soft and was the first time they had a chance. 1-1 is okay. (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
