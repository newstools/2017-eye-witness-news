On Monday, the games federation confirmed that host city Durban had failed to deliver on a number of key obligations and commitments. CAPE TOWN - South Africa Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee president Gideon Sam says there could be repercussions after Durban was stripped of hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games.On Monday, the games federation confirmed the city had failed to deliver on a number of key obligations and commitments.Durban won the rights to host the sporting extravaganza in 2015. The bid process is estimated to have cost around R100 million. Sam says no one could've foreseen the outcome. You know you saw a statement by Minister Jeff Radebe at one point, with Cabinet saying they d support the bid. Then things changed. So we just have to live with that and we can try and point fingers. Who are we going to put in the firing line? Meanwhile, Brij Maharaj, a geography and environmental sciences professor, says it s no surprise that the country lost the bid as it was flawed from the beginning. I don t think we should have made the bid at all and it s an embarrassment to the country, as we re unable to honour our international sporting obligations. He says South Africa could have used the money on something else. It is a delicate balancing act and I don t think we apply our minds when we make these bids. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
