The relationship between Malaysia &amp; North Korea has soured since Kim Jong Un's estranged half brother was murdered. Malaysia will deport a North Korean held in connection with the death of Kim Jong Nam, and cancel visa-free entry for all North Koreans, as diplomatic ties between the two countries frayed further following the murder at Kuala Lumpur's airport.The relationship between Malaysia and North Korea has soured since the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was murdered two weeks ago at Kuala Lumpur International Airport with a super toxic nerve agent VX.South Korean intelligence and US officials say the murder was an assassination organised by North Korean agents, though the only suspects charged in the case so far are an Indonesian woman and a Vietnamese woman.Police are also holding one North Korean man and want to question seven others, including a senior official in the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur.But, the detained North Korean, Ri Jong Chol, will be deported on Friday as there is insufficient evidence to charge him, Malaysian Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali told Reuters in a text message on Thursday.Ri was arrested in Kuala Lumpur on 17 February with a work permit that had been valid till 6 February 2017.It is unclear what Ri's suspected role was in the murder.Security camera footage showed two women assaulting Kim Jong Nam at the airport as he was waiting to board a flight to Macau, where he had been living with his family under Chinese protection.Malaysian police say they smeared his face with VX nerve agent, a chemical classified by the United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction, and that Kim died within 20 minutes of being attacked.North Korea, which has not accepted that the dead man is Kim Jong Nam, said on Thursday that there were strong indications a heart attack killed the North Korean national.Speaking to reporters outside the embassy in Kuala Lumpur, former North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Nations Ri Tong Il questioned the alleged use of VX, saying samples should be sent to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).&quot;If it is true that it was used, then the samples should be sent to the office of OPCW,&quot; Ri said.&quot;In case it is proved by the two separate international laboratories, with the same conclusion, then they should come to identify who is the one that made it. Who is the one that brought it into Malaysia,&quot; he added.Ri is heading a high level diplomatic delegation that met with Malaysian cabinet ministers after arriving in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week.North Korea had earlier tried to convince Malaysia not to perform an autopsy on Kim Jong Nam's body, and to release three suspects detained in connection with the killing.The women, who could face the death penalty, have told diplomats from their countries that they had believed they were carrying out a prank for a reality television show.Police say four of the other North Korean suspects have fled Malaysia. Three other suspects - a diplomat, an Air Koryo official and another North Korean - are yet to come forward.
