Helen Zille has reiterated that her tweets were not justifying or praising colonialism or apartheid. CAPE TOWN - Premier Helen Zille has again apologised for the offence caused by her controversial tweets on colonialism. Members of the Provincial Legislature (MPLs) have had a snap debate over Zille s tweets following complaints from the African National Congress (ANC), which accuses the Premier of breaking her oath of office.The ANC and the Economic Freedom Fighters have called on Zille to either resign or for the Democratic Alliance recall her for tweeting that the legacy of colonialism was not only negative.Zille has reiterated that her tweets were not justifying or praising colonialism or apartheid. She says colonialism had a diabolical impact on the world and South Africa was not spared. This was the very premise of my tweets, anyone who read them without a personal or political agenda would have understood that. The Premier adds her statements were not meant to cause harm. But if there was anyone who genuinely thought that I was defending, praising or justifying colonialism I apologise unreservedly and stress that this was not so. Zille also used her efforts in the fight against apartheid as an anecdote to reject claims she supports the unjust system.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
