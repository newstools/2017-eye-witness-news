Herman Mashaba repeatedly said he scrapped Jozi@Work because it only benefitted the politically connected. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Economic Development MEC Lebogang Maile says Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba is being petty by scrapping projects that the previous African National Congress (ANC) administration had created.He made the comments during a post state of the province briefing. Maile says that he believes the projects were good for the economy.The MEC says Mashaba is being reckless by scrapping a project such as Jozi@Work. I think it s reckless because there s about 8,000 people there who are employed and benefiting from this opportunity. Both Maile and MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Paul Mashatile say they believe the decision to abolish the so called 'vanity projects' was politically motivated. A political desire to create a political impression that the ANC-led administration has not done anything good and to try and destroy all the good work that has been done. Mashaba has repeatedly said he scrapped the projects because they only benefited the politically connected and were a straining on the city s finances.
