Stellenbosch University's Collette Schultz-Herzenberg says it's clear what the party has to do now. CAPE TOWN With the Democratic Alliance (DA)'s federal executive now set to decide on a report into Western Cape Premier Helen Zille's colonialism tweets pressure continues to mount for the party to take decisive action.Zille recently caused outrage when she tweeted on colonialism saying its legacy wasn't only negative.Yesterday, the DA's federal legal committee met with Zille, as part of its probe into the matter compiling a report which has been handed over to the executive.While it's not known when the executive will publicly comment on the report, Stellenbosch University's Collette Schultz-Herzenberg says it's clear what the party has to do now. Helen Zille has done the party some damage and now it s up to the leadership of the party to distance itself from that type of rhetoric. Meanwhile, the Black First Land First Movement (BLF) says it has opened a crimen injuria case at the Hillbrow police station against Zille.BLF says she has unlawfully and intentionally impaired the dignity of black people- and insulted their collective pain- caused by colonialism.BLF deputy president Zanele Lwana says Zille must be prosecuted. Her comments were racist in the manner that oppressed the dignity of black people and undermined the challenges that black people face today as a result of colonialism.
