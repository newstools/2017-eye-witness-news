That plan is continuing, the board s merely exercising oversight. It has approved the turnaround plan, and it is the responsibility of management to implement the plan. Strategic Asset Development Group Executive Piet Sebola outlined the turnaround plan to stabilise the organisation and address its poor offering and financial distress. The turnaround [plan], at the heart of it, is issues related to how we run and operate the business. It starts with our service planning, revenue collection, etc. The plan, which involves a 10-year investment of R172 billion, includes increasing the rolling stock, reducing fare evasion through the use of technology, upgrading signalling systems and the rehabilitation of track infrastructure.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
