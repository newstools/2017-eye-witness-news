President Jacob Zuma is taking the report on review.Brown s has briefed Parliament s public enterprises committee on the state-owned enterprises that fall under her. She was the first Cabinet minister to endorse the idea of a commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture and she s sticking to her guns. The way this report has to go, it is the president s prerogative, but it remains my view that there should be a commission.
