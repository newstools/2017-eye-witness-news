We re appealing to anyone who might have information to contact the nearest police station or phone the Crime Line on 08600 10111 at all hours. All the information will be rewarded. He says Benoni has been plagued by illegal miner murders in the past. However, he can t confirm whether this is the largest mass killing to date. We suspect that there might be illegal miners because they then engage in illegal activities in the area and in the past we ve seen other people working in rival gangs. On Monday, illegal miners in the area told Eyewitness News that they heard gunshots at a nearby shaft on Sunday. They warned that so-called rival zama zamas are armed and dangerous.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
