The research shows three-quarters of companies surveyed had a positive perception of Cape Town as a base to do business in Africa. JOHANNESBURG Western Cape Investment and Trade and Promotion Agency (Wesgro) says its research shows the rest of Africa has become the bread and butter for Western Cape exports.The investment and trade agency released the document titled The Western Cape: Africa's Trade and Investment Springboard.The research shows three-quarters of companies surveyed had a positive perception of Cape Town as a base to do business in Africa.It further highlights the province's export growth of 17.8% since 2012 to R121 billion last year.Wesgro s Tim Harris said most of this growth stems from African countries. As a province, our main products are agricultural so we need to maintain exports to our traditional markets in Europe and the US; we need to grow exports into the BRICS countries like China and Brazil. But really our bread and butter comes from the rest of this continent. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
