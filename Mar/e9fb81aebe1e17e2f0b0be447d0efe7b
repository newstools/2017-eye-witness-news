Minister Jeff Radebe was asked if government would take any action over the crisis, but he would not reveal any details. CAPE TOWN - Cabinet has now met to discuss the situation around the payment of social grants from 1 April.The meeting took place against the back-drop of a directive issued by the Constitutional Court on Tuesday, ordering the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to explain exactly when it knew that it would not be able to make payments.Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe was asked if government would take any action over the crisis, but he would not reveal any details. You should be aware that last week, cabinet decided that today that matter is going to be discussed, so I think let s wait until cabinet finalises on that specific matter. WATCH: Dlamini again promises that grants will be paid on 1 AprilCALLS FOR INQUIRYMeanwhile on Tuesday, the Democratic Alliance (DA) and African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) called for a full Parliamentary inquiry into the payment of social grants.The opposition said it s not satisfied with the information provided by Minister Bathabile Dlamini at a meeting of Parliament s Scopa on Tuesday.The DA said Dlamini failed to provide clear answers on a pending new contract with CPS, while the ACDP said her assurances that grants will be paid next month are not convincing.Dlamini appeared to throw officials under the bus in attempting to explain why Sassa was trying to negotiate an eleventh hour deal with CPS, but later said she was not blaming them.The ACDP said it's concerned that the minister insists CPS is the only company to provide the required service, and it wants to see a five-year plan to revolutionise Sassa.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
