The party has on a number of occasions tabled the motion before Parliament without success. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on political parties to set aside their personal interest and support the party in its motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma in the wake of his recent Cabinet reshuffle.The DA says Zuma s decision to fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his Deputy Mcebisi Jonas should be a rallying call for South Africans to unite in defense of the Constitution.The party has on a number of occasions tabled the motion before Parliament without success.Spokesperson Mabine Seabe says this motion is the most powerful message it can send. A motion of no confidence is the most powerful message we can send to the president that no longer would we support or no longer would Parliament support your mismanagement of the economy and mismanagement of the country. And equally so, as political parties, we must put our narrow differences aside. Meanwhile, there s been concern as to how the financial industry will react to newly appointed Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, considering his experience in that ministry.Economist Russel Lamberti says he cannot imagine a good outlook for the economy in the wake of the axing of Gordhan and Jonas.Lamberti says the country may be in for a rough couple of weeks, with the rand reacting the same way it did when former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene was removed or even worse. The likelihood is that the foreign investment community, the local investment community are going to see it in a very bad light and it looks like we re in for another rough ride. It looks like a repeat of December 2015 but this time maybe more rougher.
