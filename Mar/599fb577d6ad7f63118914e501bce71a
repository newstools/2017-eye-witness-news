Suspected militiamen have kidnapped 5 workers at Banro Corp&#8217;s Namoya gold mine in eastern DRC, the company says. KINSHASA - Suspected militiamen have kidnapped five workers at Banro Corp s Namoya gold mine in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the company said on Thursday, in the second attack on its facilities in a month.The attack took place during the night of Tuesday into Wednesday and an investigation is underway, Crispin Mutwedu, a senior Banro official, told Reuters, adding that a local militia had been threatening the mine recently.The hostages included a French national, a Tanzanian and three Congolese, he said.New York and Toronto-listed Banro s four gold mines in eastern Congo have been plagued both by illegal miners squatting on site and by armed groups - some of the dozens of militias that remain active despite the official end to a regional conflict in 2003.Three police officers and one assailant were killed last month when armed robbers attacked Banro s Twangiza gold mine in neighbouring South Kivu province.Namoya poured its first gold last January and produced 93,253 ounces of gold in 2016.
