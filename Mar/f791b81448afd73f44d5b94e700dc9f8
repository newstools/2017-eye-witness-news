With 14 out of 42 athletes banned in the past two years, Johnson believes he has a reason to be worried about the increasing use of banned substances. BENGALURU - Use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs are a major concern for the Rugby Union and the switch from the amateur to professional era has played a major part in the issue, former England captain and coach Martin Johnson has said.With 14 out of 42 athletes banned in the past two years by UK Anti-Doping coming from Rugby Union in England and Wales, Johnson believes he has a reason to be worried about the increasing use of banned substances.&quot;When I started playing, did I think anyone around the international team was (using drugs)? No chance,&quot; Johnson, who led England to 2003 World Cup victory, told the Times.&quot;Would you be worried about it now? Absolutely. Things are more available, the internet, knowledge of it is more widespread.&quot;People are taking them, by all account, for vanity reasons.&quot;Johnson, however, said the lucrative professional era has been the major contributing factor to the problem.&quot;Now the game is professional and we live in a different time where kids can see a livelihood and a good livelihood out of doing it, then you've got to be very careful,&quot; he added.
