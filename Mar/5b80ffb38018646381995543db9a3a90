The Presidency says Standard Bank is seeking relief which would affect President Jacob Zuma and other members of the Cabinet. PRETORIA The Presidency has moved to clarify its attempt to be involved in the Pretoria High Court case brought by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan against Gupta-owned companies.The court on Tuesday rejected the president s attempt to be joined as an interested party. Gordhan has asked the court to declare that he is not authorised to intervene in the fight between the Gupta-owned companies and the banks. Between December 2015 and April last year the country s big four banks cut ties with the Gupta companies. The Presidency says Standard Bank is seeking relief which would affect President Jacob Zuma and other members of the Cabinet.The president is concerned that the court could issue an order which would bind the president without him actually being party to the matter when it is heard. The bank specifically asks that no members of the executive, including Zuma and his Cabinet, may intervene in their decision to cut ties with the Gupta companies. Judge President Dunstan Mlambo put it to counsel for the Presidency that Zuma was in possession of affidavits since December but has only now decided to act. Mlambo told counsel that they were not recognised by the court and should instead watch proceedings. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
