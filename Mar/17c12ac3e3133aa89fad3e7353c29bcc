Phahlane says the police&#8217;s relationship with the Hawks is sound but stopped short of addressing airport allegations. PRETORIA - Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane has dismissed claims that there is a war between the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the Hawks at OR Tambo International Airport which has undermined the security at the facility. Phahlane made the comments during a briefing in Pretoria on the brazen robbery at the airport earlier this week. Several robbers dressed in police uniforms and driving bogus cop cars held up security on Tuesday night before stealing more than two dozen bags filled with foreign currency. Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert Mcbride told Parliament last month about a feud between the authorities at the airport which has led to at least two deaths. Phahlane says the police s relationship with the Hawks is sound but stopped short of addressing allegations specificity related to the airport. There is no war between SAPS and the Hawks. They are a family and work together anyway. I can t respond to what has been said outside of this space. He assured the public that the airport is safe. We are doing well. Once incident cannot define us as institutions that are not doing well. The police and Airports Company South Africa have committed themselves to reviewing the current security arrangements.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
