Judge Winston Msimeki dismissed Radovan Krejcir's attempted to prevent his associate from taking the stand. JOHANNESBURG - The judge hearing the Sam Issa murder trial has dismissed yet another application for a postponement, and another for him to recuse himself, paving the way for the first witness to take the stand. Issa, a Lebanese drug dealer, was gunned down in Bedfordview in 2013. Radovan Krejcir and three others are on trial for the murder. Finally, after dozens of delays and years of postponements, the State s first witness is expected to testify about the 2013 murder of Issa. Bulgarian Mike Grigorov turned State witness in January, dropping a bombshell on this trial. On Tuesday, Krejcir attempted to prevent his associate from taking the stand by asking for a postponement because he didn t have access to a new e-reader which he uses to read legal documents. He also claimed he couldn t go ahead because he hadn t been able to see a psychiatrist and his medication was not working. Krejcir s co-accused also brought an application for Judge Winston Msimeki to recuse himself; that bid failed, paving the way for Grigorov to take the stand.[FROM THE ARCHIVE] Sam Issa gunned down in drive-by shootingAfter more than three years and repeated delays, the trial for the underworld style killing of Lebanese drug dealer Sam Black Issa, believed to be linked to Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir is finally underway.
