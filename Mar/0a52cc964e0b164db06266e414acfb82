The power utility lodged papers at the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday for what it calls wrongful and defamatory actions by the party. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it s seeking a high court's protection from abuse of power and cheap politicking that has been at the centre of the Democratic Alliance s (DA) public campaign against the utility.Eskom lodged papers at the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday for what it calls wrongful and defamatory actions.It relates to an article published on the DA s website where the party refers to the Dentons report, claiming widespread corruption within the top ranks of the entity and extensive corruption implicating acting CEO Matshela Koko.Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe says: The normal processes will be underway, but you cannot say someone is guilty until it is proven by a court of law. However, the DA s Natasha Mazzone says the utility has no case. When there are reports such as the Dentons report, I m certainly not going to keep quiet. If Eskom thinks that by suing me they are going to stop me from doing my job then they have another thing coming. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
