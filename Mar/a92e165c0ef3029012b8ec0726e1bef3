All parties except for the UDM backed the report, which calls for the dissolution of the SABC board. CAPE TOWN - The National Assembly has adopted the report of the parliamentary inquiry into the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board.All parties except for the United Democratic Movement (UDM) backed the report, which calls for the dissolution of the board, including its remaining executive members.The UDM opposed the report because it believes disgraced former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng should have been called to give evidence before the inquiry.MPs described the collapse of corporate governance and political interference in the SABC as a tale of Shakespearian proportions.The Democratic Alliance s Mike Waters said: The main characters in this tragedy are the minister of communications, the honourable Faith Muthambi, and Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng, likened to Lady Macbeth and Lord Macbeth - with the journalists and staff being their victims. The Inkatha Freedom Party s Narend Signh said: It is a tale of unchecked greed, power, corruption, mismanagement, incapacity, incompetence, irregularity and unlawfulness. Opposition parties are urging President Jacob Zuma to fire Muthambi.The report s adoption means the inquiry s recommendations can now be implemented, including the appointment of an interim board to get the public broadcaster back on track.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
