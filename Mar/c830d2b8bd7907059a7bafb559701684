JOHANNESBURG A parliamentary hearing has heard that government is looking to tighten a proposed demerit system for errant drivers to include learner drivers and foreigners.The demerit system forms part of amendments to the country s traffic offences law which is currently being trialed in Johannesburg and Tshwane. But the Road Traffic Infringement Agency says it s refining the initial demerit proposal to ensure everyone who is guilty of a traffic offense in the country is treated equally.The Road Traffic Infringement Agency says it plans to penalise new drivers who behave recklessly even before they can apply for a driver's license.Exceeding the speed limit can earn a driver up to three demerit points out of a maximum of twelve, before a license is suspended.Those who have been found guilty of a traffic offence by a court of law will automatically earn themselves six demerits and will be forced to attend a rehabilitation programme to get their license back.The agency's Peter Baloyi said: First-time offenders will have six demerits reduced upon completion of the two mandatory rehab programmes. The agency says it s also investigating whether it can serve foreign drivers with spot fines for traffic infringements.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
