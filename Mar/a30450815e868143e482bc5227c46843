Brendan Venter is widely expected to join Allister Coetzee&#8217;s backroom staff in the build-up to the Test series against France. CAPE TOWN - Stormers coach Robbie Fleck is confident Brendan Venter will be able to make a significant impact in South African rugby.Venter, a former Springbok himself, is widely expected to join Allister Coetzee s backroom staff in the build up to the Test series against France.The 47-year-old has had spells with Saracens, the Sharks, London Irish and most recently helping Italy with their defence in the Six Nations.Venter is known for his creativity and innovation as England found out in a Six Nations match Italy used an astonishing tactic of declining to engage in rucks which caused confusion for players and fans alike.Fleck feels SA Rugby s proposal of signing Venter would be a coup for the nation. I rate him as a coach. I rate him as a man. He is a good man. He is going to add massive value to South Africa rugby. It s a great decision to get him involved. Fleck says Venter has an impeccable resume which speaks for itself. His track record speaks for itself when it comes to coaching. From a defensive point of view, he is outstanding. He transformed the Sharks defensively, every team that he has coached he s been able to do that so I think it s an outstanding addition to South African rugby. Fleck believes Venter s impact won t just be felt in the national team.&quot;It will certainly give the players a lot of confidence, not just with the Springboks but players nationally. So I am looking forward to his input into South African rugby.&quot;The Springbok squad will meet for their second training camp of the year this weekend in Stellenbosch.(Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
