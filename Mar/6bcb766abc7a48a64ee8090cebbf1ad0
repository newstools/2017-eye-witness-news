Authorities have now formally revoked South Africa's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court. JOHANNESBURG - South African authorities have been asked to appear in the International Criminal Court (ICC) next month over the country's failure to arrest Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir during a visit two years ago.Government announced its intention to leave the ICC in 2015 after the Hague-based court criticised it for disregarding an order to arrest al-Bashir, who is accused of genocide and war crimes. Al-Bashir has denied the accusations. South Africa notified the ICC on Tuesday of its reversal in order to adhere to the judgment that ordered the country to cancel the planned pull out with immediate effect.However, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) told the media in Rosebank that this action did not necessarily mean that South Africa would abandon its overall efforts to withdraw from the Rome Statute for good.The ICJ s Arnold Tsunga says this makes their submission to encourage South Africa to remain in the ICC vital. I think it s a temporary setback for the authorities. There hasn t been a pronouncement that the overall strategy of withdrawal is going to be abandoned. The jurists made their submissions to the portfolio committee on justice, opposing any efforts by the government to leave the ICC.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
