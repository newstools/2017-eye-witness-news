The Oakbay group of companies says the kind of court order being sought by Gordhan will not prevent the harm the minister believes is being caused to the banking sector. PRETORIA - The Oakbay group of companie s has argued that there are no legal grounds upon which the court can issue the declaratory order being sought by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.The minister has asked the High Court in Pretoria to rule that he is not legally permitted to intervene in the fight between the Gupta-owned companies and the banks.The country's big four banks cut ties with the Guptas about a year ago, citing reputational risk.The Oakbay group of companies has argued that the kind of court order being sought by Gordhan will not prevent the harm the minister believes is being caused to the banking sector.Oakbay s Advocate Cedric Puckrin read from Gordhan s affidavit where he says continued public assertions that the banks acted against the Guptas for no reason and improperly are harmful to the integrity of the banking sector. Even if that was so it doesn t bear on the notice of motion and the declivity order wouldn t affect that. They would need an interdict. Puckrin says the court should not pronounce on this matter, because it is purely academic and abstract. The governor of the Reserve Bank, Lesetja Kganyago, has supported the application, saying an order would provide clarity and certainty on the minister s powers.Judgment has been reserved.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
