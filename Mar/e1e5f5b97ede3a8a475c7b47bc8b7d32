Mariya Savinova was banned for four years by CAS for doping from July 2010 until August 2013 after she was found to have taken illegal performance enhancing substances. CAPE TOWN Caster Semenya will have to wait for Olympic Gold medal from London 2012 which she was awarded retroactively.This came after Russia s Mariya Savinova, who was stripped of 800 metres gold, filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) just before the deadline given to her.Semenya was upgraded from silver to gold which she added to the 800m title she won at the Rio Olympics last year. Savinova was banned for four years by CAS for doping from July 2010 until August 2013 after she was found to have taken illegal performance enhancing substances.She had all her records dating back to the 2011 World Championships rescinded.International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Communications manager Yannis Nikolaou says the Russian appealed at the last minute to CAS. We though the deadline she had, we thought that expired but the very last day she appealed and we just received a confirmation that she appealed. The appeal is not to us (IAAF) but to CAS. Nikolaou could not put an exact timeline as to when CSA would hear the appeal and make a decision.&quot;There is another delay for Semenya to see if she gets the gold or not because finally Savinova decided to appeal and we have to wait one, two months at least. I don t think it will take longer than two months, usually it is this period but you never know.&quot;
