The PPF&#8217;s National Chair Tembakazi Mnyaka says National Treasury continues to be a stumbling block for transformation. JOHANNESBURG The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) says if it s critiquing of National Treasury is seen as waging a dirty war then so be it because the organisation remains committed to transformation.On Thursday, the PPF responded to claims by the Democratic Alliance (DA) that it received R840,000 from Transnet and Eskom during Brian Molefe s tenure.It says just like other non-profit entities the money received from the parastatal was a sponsorship to fund certain programs and events.The PPF s national chair Tembakazi Mnyaka says Treasury continues to be a stumbling block for transformation. If my raising these pertinent issues [means] we re thus engaging in a dirty war with Minister Gordhan, then so be it, because the PPF is firm and resolute on this matter. But the DA's David Maynier says they won t sit back and watch as state-owned entities recycle public funds to organisations pushing political agendas. It s scoring political agendas on behalf of factions in the ruling party or on behalf of families supporting factions in the ruling party. The PPF joins organisations such as the Black Business Council and the KwaZulu-Natal ANC Youth League in criticising Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan for failing to outline a plan for radical economic transformation.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
