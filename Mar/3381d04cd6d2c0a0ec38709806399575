Zane Dangor resigned from the department on Friday, citing a breakdown in his relationship with Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini. JOHANNESBURG Parliament s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) says it notes with disappointment the resignation of Zane Dangor, the former director-general of the Social Development Department. Dangor resigned from the department on Friday, citing a breakdown in his relationship with Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini regarding the social grants debacle. It s a breakdown in the relationship between the myself and minister following disagreements on the management of the processes on paying the grants on 1 April, particularly disagreements on Sassa s obligation in relation to the Constitutional Court, Dangor said.The committee says Dangor s resignation indicates that the forces of corruption within the department were simply overwhelming and it s sad that someone who wanted to do the right thing has been forced out. Public accounts chairperson Themba Godi says: He was appointed in November 2016. He left after just three or four months and this does not look well for the department, especially at a time when it s involved in sensitive negotiations involving Sassa. The department's contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) comes to an end this month. In 2014, the Constitutional Court found that the contract with CPS was invalid, because a proper procurement process was not followed.Scopa has criticised the department and Sassa officials for not finding an alternative solution since the ruling in 2014.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
