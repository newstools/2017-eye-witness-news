Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court allowed the current service provider to continue for another year. CAPE TOWN - Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) chairperson Themba Godi says the committee will closely monitor South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) to ensure it complies with a Constitutional Court order to take over social grant payments next year.Godi says he believes the Post Office has the skills and capacity to do the job.Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court allowed the current service provider, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), to continue for another year.Scopa has been meeting with Sassa and the Post Office in Centurion on Wednesday.In a written response to a Parliamentary question from the Democratic Alliance (DA), Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has revealed Sassa has not yet presented its proposed grant payment model to National Treasury.She says this will be done in due course and within her department s existing budget. Godi says his committee is not happy with unresolved issues of fruitless and wasteful expenditure at Sassa. This includes irregular expenditure on security for Dlamini's children and over a million rand spent on functions that were cancelled.Godi says Sassa's contract with CPS also needs to be probed. Clearly there's a lot of unanswered questions about the relationship between the minister and CPS and some officials in Sassa and Social Development. Godi added Scopa will be expecting formal representations from Sassa in the coming months on its plans to take over grant payments.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
