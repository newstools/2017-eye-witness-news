As Kaizer Chiefs gear up to face Orlando Pirates in a league match concerns have been raised about the price of tickets. JOHANNESBURG - The Soweto Derby, the annual clashes between soccer kings Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, has a way of splitting the nation, ratcheting up debate and forcing temperatures to rise, despite some rather limp encounters on the field in recent times.But this time, Amakhosi fans and Bucs supporters aren't only squabbling about who has the best players or who will come out on top.Soccer lovers have raised concerns about a decision by Kaizer Chiefs, who are the hosts for tomorrow's Premier Soccer League (PSL) match at FNB Stadium, to raise the price of entry-level tickets from R40 to R70.Huh!!!! From R40 to R70 for a ticket? Why has the price gone up, is it for all PSL games or just #SowetoDerby? @gwalax pic.twitter.com/WtSxlhoF5j@ThabisoTema I heard the R40 ticket is now R70. I can&#39;t imagine watching a dull game with 90% extra. #SowetoDerby can wait@gwalax, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a lot more expensive to host the #sowetoderby due to high safety &amp; security, hence the R70.
