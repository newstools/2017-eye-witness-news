Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says Pravin Gordhan has served South Africa with distinction. JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the removal of the finance minister was largely based on an intelligence report, which he believes is unsubstantiated.Ramaphosa says the report claims Pravin Gordhan was going to London to mobilise markets against our country.He says in 2001 he experienced something similar when an intelligence report accused him of planning to overthrow the government of then president Thabo Mbeki.Ramaphosa says he raised his concerns and objection about the removal of the finance minister, especially since he is a man that has served the country with such distinction. And I told the president that I would not agree with him on his reasoning to remove the minister of finance. I told him that this I would articulate publicly. So this is where we are. He has made his choice and let me say the president has the prerogative to appoint and dismiss ministers of his Cabinet to his choice. And he has exercised his choice. (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
