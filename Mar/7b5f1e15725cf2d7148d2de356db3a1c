Satawu says it doesn&#8217;t agree with the federation&#8217;s position that Brian Molefe shouldn&#8217;t have been sworn in as a Member of Parliament. JOHANNESBURG - Transport union South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) says its broken ranks with its affiliate labour federation Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), saying it doesn t agree with the federation s position that Brian Molefe shouldn t have been sworn in as a Member of Parliament (MP).Last week, Cosatu described Molefe s appointment as disappointing and argued that the former Eskom CEO still needs to respond to allegations of corruption during his term as the power utility s head.Molefe was sworn in as an MP after he was nominated by the North West African National Congress (ANC) to fill a vacancy in the National Assembly.As soon as Molefe was sworn in as an MP, Satawu welcomed his nomination praising him and saying Parliament and government are ready for him.But last week Cosatu said the transport union has changed its tune and now agrees with the federation s position that Molefe s ascendance to Parliament is unfortunate.But Satawu s General Secretary Zenzo Mahlangu says that s not true. We made a decision and we stand by it. Meanwhile, the North West ANC says it s still waiting for FNB to conclude its investigation into the authenticity of Molefe s ANC membership form.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
