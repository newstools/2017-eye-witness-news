The educator has tendered his resignation with immediate effect. Bodibe says although the department can no longer carry on with the investigation, it is seeking other legal avenues to ensure that the man answers to the charges levelled against him. He resigned while being invested for a serious offence which can lead to an educator being struck off the roll of educators. We are still taking legal advice on this matter.
