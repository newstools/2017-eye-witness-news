The CEC forecast is 6% higher than market expectations of 13.11 million tonnes, according to a Reuters' poll of traders. JOHANNESBURG South Africa will likely harvest 13.918 million tonnes of maize in 2017, 79% more than last year as improved rain boosted production, the government's Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) said. The CEC forecast is 6% higher than market expectations of 13.11 million tonnes, according to a Reuters' poll of traders.In 2016, farmers reaped 7.78 million tonnes of maize, 22% less than the previous harvest, pushing up food prices and fuelling inflation after a scorching drought triggered by an El Ni o weather pattern.Favourable weather conditions brought on by a La Ni a weather system have brought increased rainfall over the maize belt during the summer growing season.Prices for the staple white maize have more than halved from record peaks of over R5,000 a tonne scaled early last year and have fallen below R2,000 a tonne, which could help lower food inflation.
