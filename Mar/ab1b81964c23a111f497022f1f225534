Pravin Gordhan has asked the court to declare that he does not have the authority to intervene in the Gupta fight with the banks. JOHANNESBURG - The High Court has dismissed an application which challenged the authority of the State attorney to represent Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. It s also struck from the record the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) certificate which showed billions of rands worth of suspicious transactions involving Gupta-owned companies. The minister has asked the court to declare that he does not have the authority to intervene in the Gupta fight with the banks which closed its accounts. Judge President Dunstan Mlambo says Sahara Computers filed its application challenging the authority of the State attorney to represent Minister Gordhan late. We are satisfied that the State attorney has the requisite authority to represent the applicant in these proceedings. Therefore, the application for condonation is dismissed. He says the strike out application referred to matters in Gordhan s founding affidavit, which included the FIC report. There is merit to the striking out application and this application by the Oakbay group is granted. The court also granted the minister s application to strike out allegations Sahara made of him being involved in a political conspiracy. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
