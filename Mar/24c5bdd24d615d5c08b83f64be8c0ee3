The Eastern Cape Provincial Executive Committee served newly-elected ANC Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson Andile Lungisa with a letter ordering him to step down by Thursday. CAPE TOWN - Newly-elected African National Congress (ANC) Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson Andile Lungisa has been given an ultimatum; resign or face disciplinary action.The Eastern Cape Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) served Lungisa with a letter on Tuesday, ordering him to step down by Thursday.The ANC councillor, who s also a PEC member, was elected as regional chairperson two weeks ago despite being warned not to stand. This because of the post he holds in the PEC.Provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane says the letter follows a meeting with Lungisa on Monday. In the ANC, the highest decision-making body is none other than the NEC in between conferences. When they give directive we have to implement. Mabuyane adds Lungisa has raised his own concerns. He s arguing his points purely from a Constitution point of view and the interpretation of the clause, which seems like the explanation and the clarification on that has been straight forward.
