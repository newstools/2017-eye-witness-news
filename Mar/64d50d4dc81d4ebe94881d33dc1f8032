This could see the bank readjust its inflationary outlook and a possibility of a rate cut.Since the beginning of the week, the rand weakened by more than 3%.The uncertainty stemming from President Jacob Zum a's call to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas to abort the international investment roadshow has also weakened the bond market.While the Reserve Bank is expected to keep the repo rate at 7%, experts anticipate the bank's accompanying statement to make some reference to the recent events.Among them is economist Lesiba Mothatha, who believes the bank will be very vigilant in its response .The central bank will make its announcement this Thursday.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
