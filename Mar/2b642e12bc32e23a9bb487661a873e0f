CAPE TOWN - This is the last week Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has to make good on his promise to gazette the redrafted mining charter.The charter serves as a guideline for transformation within the industry. Zwane promised that a new document would be promulgated before the end of this month.Mining companies have been waiting for the finalisation of the latest charter since the draft was published last year. Some aspects of the draft document have been contested by industry role players.Industry participants have been in discussions with the Department of Mineral Resources over some points contained in the proposed new mining charter.Among them is the Chamber of Mines, which has highlighted some of its concerns.The body's Tobello Chabana says they are worried that some of the new targets, such as those governing procurement policies, may be unattainable. Previously the industry had to meet a 40% procurement from BEE entities. What they ve done now is put in place a 70% of locally manufactured goods from BEE entities. Moreover, the proposed charter will set aside the &quot;once empowered always empowered&quot; clause, meaning companies have to ensure it maintains its black empowerment quota of 26% at all times, even when shares change ownership.The next government gazette will be published this Friday.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
