It is improper that when the board is left with just a few months, they should be hurriedly removed from office. He earlier said Peters decision was not within the confines of the law as she had not given reasons for her actions. We think that the action itself in contrary to public interest. It s in the interest of the public that the good work that we have doing or rooting out corruption and the fact that we already have two major cases.
