Eight classrooms and the admin block at the Lamulelani High School were burnt on Saturday night. JOHANNESBURG Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says she s extremely disappointed at the news of yet another school being torched, this time in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga.Eight classrooms and the admin block at the Lamulelani High School were burnt on Saturday night.Motshekga says food and other valuable items were taken from the building before it was set alight. It s not yet clear whether the incident at the Lamulelani High School in Mpumalanga is linked to recent service delivery protests in Bushbuckridge.The Education Department s Elijah Mhlanga says police are investigating. There have been some protests in that area for several weeks now and at some point, schools were closed in that area. About five schools were affected. Mhlanga says whether community members are aggrieved this does not give them a right to vandalise schools. For eight classrooms to be gutted in that way, that s serious damage. The torched building was only discovered a day later by community members grazing cattle as the school is secluded from residential areas.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
