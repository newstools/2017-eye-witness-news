This latest move means a by-election will have to be held. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress in the Western Cape has recalled the Kannaland mayor and deputy mayor. After the ANC and Democratic Alliance could not win an outright majority in last year's local government elections, councillors brokered a deal to force out incumbent mayor Jeffery Donson, who is from the Independent Civic Organisation of South Africa (Icosa).This latest move means a by-election will have to be held.The ANC s Yonela Diko says the partnership with the DA is simply unsustainable. Our next option, if we win the outright majority vote and we re not comfortable with Icosa or DA, is to take back the opposition benches. The DA s Anneke Scheepers has questioned the timing of the move. There s a forensic investigation into the Kannaland Municipality which is pending and stands to uncover the corruption. The timing of this is suspicious. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
