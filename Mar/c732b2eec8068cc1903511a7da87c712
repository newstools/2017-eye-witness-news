Bathabile Dlamini says it was the National Treasury which decided to distance itself from the Sassa matter. JOHANNESBURG With reports of mounting tensions between the Social Development Department and National Treasury persisting, Bathabile Dlamini has avoided answering questions about her working relationship with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Yesterday, President Jacob Zuma released a statement saying he had met with both ministers regarding the Sassa debacle. Dlamini says it's the media which has been perpetuating the idea that social grants will not be paid on 1 April as promised by the department.While Zuma has assured that the Sassa debacle is solvable, questions have been raised about Dlamini s working relationship with Gordhan.She says it was the National Treasury which decided to distance itself from the matter. We ve had conversations and the minister will continue working with us so never mind other things. The social development minister has also refused to answer questions on why director general Zane Dangor chose to resign. If he wanted to make allegations or explain to the media, that was his choice and that is not how I work with people. As it stands, there is still no signed deal on how social grants will be paid towards its 17 million beneficiaries.
