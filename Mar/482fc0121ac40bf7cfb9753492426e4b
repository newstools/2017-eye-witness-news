How do we ensure that we deal with issues of economic development? How do we deal with some of the scourge of corruption that we ve seen in society? Maimane says as a non-racial party, South Africans are not bound by race, language and religion or any superficial identity that detractors often label the DA.The official opposition says voters should give the party a chance and if they disappoint them they too should lend their ballot to another political formation.Change is coming! #Change19 @MmusiMaimane pic.twitter.com/BHxBN6Lhh6(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
