Khoza addressed the National Assembly during the debate on the final report into the public broadcaster&#8217;s board's fitness to carry out its mandate. CAPE TOWN African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Makhosi Khoza has emphasised the need for competent leadership at the embattled South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).She was addressing the National Assembly during the debate on the final report into the public broadcaster s board's fitness to carry out its mandate. Acting SABC Chief Executive Officer James Aguma informed parliament that the corporation suffered a loss of R411 million during the last financial year.Khoza says irregular contracts that surfaced during the ad hoc committee proceedings must be closely examined. I have no doubt in my mind that the ad hoc committee was meticulous in its execution of its task. It is within this context that the ANC supports this report. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
