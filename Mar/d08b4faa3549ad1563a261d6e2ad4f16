Last week, Helen Zille tweeted the legacy of colonialism was not only negative. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) will meet with Western Cape Premier Helen Zille this coming weekend to gauge whether disciplinary steps should be taken in relation to her tweets about colonialism. Last week, Zille tweeted the legacy of colonialism was not only negative. Chairperson of the DA s Federal Legal Commission Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach is set to meet with Zille. Zille s tweets, suggesting the legacy of colonialism had some positives, generated outcry from various opposition parties and the public, particularly on social media platforms. Chairperson of the DA s Federal Caucus James Selfe says if the matter is referred to a disciplinary panel, a finding will be made and recommendations will be formulated. There s a meeting taking place between Advocate Breytenbach and the Zille on Saturday, after which we will prepare a report stating whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be started against her. At a Human Rights Day event in Sharpeville on Tuesday, DA leader Mmusi Maimane once again distanced the party from Zille s comments about colonialism. At the same time, the DA s investigation into Zille s tweets is unlikely to be concluded before the weekend.Breytenbach has told Eyewitness News it will be up to the DA's federal executive to decide whether Zille should face a disciplinary hearing. The matter is still under investigation and it is unlikely that the investigation will be finalised before the weekend. After that, the matter will be referred back to the federal executive to take a decision on the way forward. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
