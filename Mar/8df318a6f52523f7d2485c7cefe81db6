The Presidency issued the order for Pravin Gordhan to come back home from the international investor roadshow in the UK in a statement that provided no reasons. JOHANNESBURG - Treasury has now confirmed that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan will be returning on Tuesday morning as instructed by President Jacob Zuma.In a statement released just a few moments ago, Treasury spokesperson Yolisa Tyanti has also confirmed that Deputy Minister Mcebisi Jonas is abandoning the US leg of the international investor roadshow. Gordhan and National Treasury Director General Lungisa Fuzile are preparing to return back to South Africa from the UK and are expected to arrive tomorrow morning. Jonas who was scheduled to undertake the United States leg of the trip will no longer be leaving tonight as planned. The Presidency issued the order for Gordhan and his deputy Jonas to come back home in a one-sentence statement that provided no reasons.Speaking on the sidelines of investor meetings in London on Monday afternoon, Gordhan said he d been planning to come home early anyway.At the same time, African National Congress (ANC) secretary general Gwede Mantashe says the instruction was not discussed at the weekend NEC meeting. Calling the minister back was not an issue for the NEC. There can be nothing in the NEC that is linked to calling the minister back. According to a source in the London business community with ties to South Africa, the mood of those involved in the roadshow ranges from disappointment to anger.With two days set aside for the London meetings, it's likely that tomorrow would have seen some important meetings taking place with investors.'ASKED TO COME BACK'Gordhan said on Monday he had not been recalled to South Africa by President Zuma, but &quot;asked to come back home&quot; and had been planning to do so anyway.Gordhan, asked by Reuters on the sidelines of investor meetings if he would return, he said &quot;yes&quot;, adding he had not planned to be part of the US leg of the investor roadshow anyway.He declined to comment on reasons for his recall and, asked if he expected a Cabinet reshuffle, said: &quot;That's the boss' prerogative.&quot;Asked by Reuters about rumours of a reshuffle, Gordhan said those decisions remain in Zuma s hands.A South African delegation was due to hold meetings in London on Monday and Tuesday, then Boston on Wednesday and New York on Thursday and Friday.While the exact reasons for the order to return are still unclear, it has led to fresh speculation that there may be a Cabinet reshuffle.Meanwhile, it's being reported that the Presidency did in fact initially grant permission for the roadshow but later rescinded its decision.No reasons for the sudden change have been provided by Zuma's office so far.According to government's ministerial handbook, ministers and their deputies must approach the President in writing two weeks before any planned official visit abroad.It s not been confirmed whether the Presidency received such a request from Gordhan or if it was submitted on time.But on Friday the President appointed Naledi Pandor as acting finance minister for the four days Gordhan was scheduled to be away from Sunday to Wednesday suggesting Zuma was aware that the minister would be out of the country.The Science and Technology Minister's office has confirmed that the president appointed her acting finance minister last week Friday.Spokesperson from Pandor's office Lunga Ngqengelele said: I can confirm that the minister received the letter appointing her as acting minister of finance from 26 to 29 March. The letter is dated 24 March 2017.
