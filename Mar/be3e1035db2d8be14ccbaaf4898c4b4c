Former chairperson Popo Molefe says the decision came as a surprise, especially after numerous attempts to meet with the minister were unsuccessful. JOHANNESBURG Former Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board chairperson Popo Molefe says he will on Monday file an urgent court application to have a decision by Transport Minister Dipuo Peters to dissolve the board set aside. The minister announced her decision following a spat between board members and former acting CEO Collins Letsoalo, who was fired for allegedly increasing his salary by 350% without approval. The case will be heard in the North Gauteng High Court on Thursday. Molefe says the decision to dissolve the board came as a surprise, especially after numerous attempts to meet with the minister were unsuccessful. We just saw on television an announcement being made that the board has been dissolved. Of course the other members were lucky because they were in the portfolio committee meeting where the announcement was made. Molefe says he believes the court will rule in the board's favour. It is improper that when the board is left with just a few months, they should be hurriedly removed from office. He earlier said Peters decision was not within the confines of the law as she had not given reasons for her actions. We think that the action itself in contrary to public interest. It s in the interest of the public that the good work that we have been doing to root out corruption and the fact that we already have two major cases. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
