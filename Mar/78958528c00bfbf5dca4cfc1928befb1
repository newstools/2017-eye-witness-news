The family of Palestinian political activist Marwan Barghouthi are in SA to promote a movie which gives insight into his life. JOHANNESBURG - The family of Palestinian political leader Marwan Barghouti, who is known as the Palestinian Mandela , says they will not give up trying to secure his release.They are in the country to promote a movie, which gives insight into the life of the imprisoned leader, who the family believes has been wrongly incarcerated by the Israeli government.Since 2002 his wife who is a lawyer and prominent advocate for the rights of Palestinian prisoners has been trying to negotiate his release with the Israeli government - along with more than 6500 others prisoners.The wife of incarcerated Palestine leader Fadwa Barghouti maintains her husband is innocent of all crimes he s accused of. I looked at the judgement against Marwan there s no proof whatsoever that he did give any order to kill or to maim any Israeli. Fadwa hopes that with the help of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation the movie documenting the life of the Palestine will expose the truth behind the detention adding pressure on Israel to release him. The film was screened in several countries and hopefully it will be screened on the main TV stations.
