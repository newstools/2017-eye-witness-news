The matter is being heard in Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s application to have the court declare that he doesn't have the authority to intervene in the Guptas&#8217; fight with the banks. PRETORIA Gupta-owned companies have applied to have the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) report showing suspicious transactions between its companies struck from the record. This is being heard in Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s application to have the court declare that he doesn't have the authority to intervene in the Guptas fight with the banks.Between December 2015 and April last year, the country s big four banks closed the Guptas business accounts, citing reputational risk. The Finance Minister included an FIC report in his application which shows 60 suspicious transaction linked to Gupta-owned companies. Advocate Cedric Puckrin argues that the report is irrelevant to this case and should be struck off.However, Advocate Jeremy Gauntlett countered this, saying the minister included the report not to show anyone s guilt but rather the extent of the issue being dealt with. Gordhan has launched his own strike out application, with Gauntlett saying the allegations that the minister is engaged in a political conspiracy are scurrilous and vexatious. Judge President Dunstan Mlambo appears to agree, saying such claims and counter claims have got nothing to do with the court. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
