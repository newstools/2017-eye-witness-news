EFF leader Julius Malema will file a Constitutional Court application, asking justices to order the Speaker to institute impeachment or disciplinary proceedings against President Zuma. CAPE TOWN - Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema will file a court application with the Constitutional Court to order the Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete to institute impeachment or disciplinary proceedings against President Jacob Zuma for conduct associated with the Nkandla scandal, including lying to Parliament on numerous occasions.&quot;Tomorrow is exactly one year since the Concourt handed down its historic judgment in the EFF's Nkandla application. Since then, we have made numerous appeals and wrote several letters to the Speaker of Parliament. All have fallen on deaf ears and have been met with violence by Parliament on EFF MPs,&quot; the EFF said in a statement on Thursday.&quot;We approach the Constitutional Court as a last resort based on the belief that Zuma's conduct around the Nkandla matter, both inside and outside of Parliament, renders him unfit to hold the high office of President of the Republic of South Africa.&quot;The president has come under fire this week for ordering the Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's return to the country without giving any explanation.Earlier on Thursday, the SACP confirmed that Zuma informed the party of his plans to reshuffle Cabinet and fire Minster Pravin Gordhan along with his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.The ANC's alliance partner says it hasn't ruled out the possibility of having SACP members serving in Cabinet resign if zuma does go ahead with a reshuffle.Just a month ago, the SACP's central executive committee resolved that should Pravin Gordhan be fired, members of the communist party deployed in Cabinet may resign en masse to avoid being complicit to what the party calls 'bad decisions'.The party's second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila says this action may be considered if president Jacob Zuma's discretion to appoint and fire ministers is exercised in a manner that doesn't take into account the collective being of the alliance.&quot;We have not yet taken a decision to withdraw from Cabinet as individuals, as ANC members. If they withdraw, they will withdraw as ANC members or necessarily as party members.&quot;The communist party says it expects to obtain feed back from the ANC's top six, which also met on Monday, to hear how they have reacted to the president's intention to make changes to Cabinet.WATCH: SACP: Zuma confirmed plans to fire Gordhan
