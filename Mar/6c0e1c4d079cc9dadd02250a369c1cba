Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has referred all questions related to his status in government to the Presidency. PRETORIA - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has referred all questions related to his status in government to the Presidency and declined to reveal details of his meeting at Luthuli House on Tuesday morning. The minister was speaking outside the High Court in Pretoria where he has asked judges to rule that he is not authorised to intervene in the matter between Gupta-owned companies and four banks. Gordhan arrived back in South Africa on Tuesday morning after being instructed to return from London by President Jacob Zuma. The minister had been back in South Africa for at least six hours and attended meetings at Luthuli House. I didn t recall myself. I think, ask the president. He confirmed that he is in fact still the Finance Minister and was visiting the court to see how his application was proceeding. Earlier, the judges ruled that Gordhan s use of the Financial Intelligence Centre report showing suspicious transaction by Gupta companies may not be used in the proceedings. The court also struck out allegations by Gupta companies that the minister was part of a conspiracy together with the banks. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
