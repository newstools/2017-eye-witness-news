Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said he will continue to rest and undergo further medical tests in Britain within weeks. LAGOS - Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said on Friday he would need more rest and health tests after coming home from nearly two months of medical leave in Britain during which his deputy, Yemi Osinbajo, stamped his authority on economic policy.&quot;I deliberately came back towards the weekend, so that the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will continue and I will continue to rest,&quot; he said in Abuja.&quot;All I will need is to do further follow ups within some weeks.&quot;Shortly after arriving back from London, the 74-year former general told officials he was feeling 'much better' but wanted to rest over the weekend, raising questions about his ability to run Africa's biggest economy and most populous nation.Osinbajo, a lawyer who is seen as more business-friendly than Buhari, played an active role in driving policy changes in Africa's top oil producer during the president's seven-week absence.The Nigerian stock market jumped to a one-month high when Buhari returned, but trimmed gains after his comments about his continued ill-health raised fears of policy confusion and a power vacuum.Dressed in a dark kaftan and Muslim prayer cap, Buhari walked stiffly but unaided from his plane after it landed at an air force base in the northern city of Kaduna.After greeting a handful of provincial and military officials, he boarded a helicopter to Abuja to address Osinbajo and his top military and security commanders in a brief speech.&quot;I deliberately came back towards the weekend so that the Vice President will continue and I will continue to rest,&quot; Buhari said at the presidential villa. &quot;All I need is to do further follow-ups within some weeks.&quot;
