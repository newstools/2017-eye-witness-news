Heading into the knockout stage Amajita have shown promising signs on attack, scoring nine goals in their three pool matches. CAPE TOWN South Africa take on hosts Zambia in the Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations semi-final today in Lusaka.Thanks to making it in the last four, South Africa has already qualified for the World Cup later this year in Korea.Heading into the knockout stage Amajita have shown promising signs on attack scoring 9 goals in their three pool matches.However, they have also conceded in every match thus far.Coach Thabo Senong says his team does not rely on one player despite striker Luther Singh topping the scoring charts. We do have positives, I mean if you look at the top goal scorer, it s our player Luther Singh but we don t focus much on that because football is a team sport at the end of the day. And if the team doesn t function well, in attack or in defence, that team can lose. Hence we ve prioritised functioning and the behaviour of our team. Senong says they are focused on their game plan and not the more fancied hosts. We told the players and it s our approach in this game that we re trying to be better than ourselves. We re not really worried about the strikers that Zambia played because we just want to improve ourselves. We ve conceded a lot of goals in this tournament, so we re trying to be better than ourselves. The coach says they have practised penalties even before the tournament. You re not going to qualify for the World Cup but you re going to a tournament, so from day one, the penalties and set pieces, we addressed those because this is still a development team.
