CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape is facing a rocky and possibly bruising road ahead of its provincial elective conference. The party is set to elect new leadership in July and the battle has not been without drama as some branch meetings have been disrupted.The upcoming provincial and national conferences were the subjects of discussions at a Provincial Executive Committee meeting earlier this week.The incumbent chairperson Phumulo Masualle will be challenged by current provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane.Former Nelson Mandela Bay metro Mayor Nceba Faku is also a candidate.Two regions, including Nelson Mandela Bay, are yet to conduct conferences four months before the provincial conference.This week the Provincial Executive Committee acknowledged different leadership preferences are causing divisions within the party, particularly among executive committee members.It says unity within structures will give the ANC the strength to regain lost ground in elections as it heads to 2019 polls.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
