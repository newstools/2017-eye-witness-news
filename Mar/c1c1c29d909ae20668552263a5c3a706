CAPE TOWN - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the Western Cape says Wednesday s postponement of Henri van Breda s trial was unforeseen.The 22-year-old triple murder accused s trial was meant to start in the Western Cape High Court.But proceedings suffered a double delay as his defence team objected to Judge Siraj Desai granting permission for the trial to be broadcast live.The trial has been postponed to 24 April for the defence to get photographs that are still outstanding from police.The NPA s Eric Ntabazalila said: If it was not for this hiccup of the media application, we would have started with the trial. We are ready to start and it is one of those things you are not in control of. WATCH: Inside the Henri Van Breda triple murder trial postponement
