Mmamoloko Kubayi matriculated 10-years ago and was a South African Students Congress branch chair at Vista University. CAPE TOWN African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Mmamoloko Kubayi s elevation to Energy Minister marks one of the biggest promotions to the ranks of President Jacob Zuma s new Cabinet.Kubayi matriculated 10-years ago and was a South African Students Congress branch chair at Vista University, later becoming deputy provincial secretary of the ANC Youth League in Gauteng.Kubayi was the chairperson of Parliament s Telecommunications and Postal Services Committee and now steps into the shoes vacated by axed Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson.The new energy minister was a parliamentary counsellor to Kgalema Motlanthe when he was deputy president and has served as a whip on the committees of Basic and Higher Education and private members bills.Seen as a hard working MP, she drew criticism when she was pictured attending to her nails while serving on the parliamentary committee that effectively quashed former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s damning report on Nkandla.Her new portfolio will see Kubayi overseeing major decisions around the country s energy arrangements, with the government s planned mega-million nuclear build arguably the most controversial item in her in-tray.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
