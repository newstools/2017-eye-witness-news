Lungisa, the Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson, called on the NEC to rule on his election which saw the ANC's Gwede Mantashe saying he had broken party rules by contesting the position. JOHANNESBURG It s still unclear whether the African National Congress (ANC) s National Executive Committee (NEC) discussed the future of its newly elected Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson Andile Lungisa at its gathering this weekend. Lungisa called for the NEC to rule on his election which saw ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe saying he had broken party rules by contesting the position.The NEC will on Monday give a briefing on the outcomes of its meeting. It was expected to focus on issues of land, racism and crime.Lungisa s retention of his position as Nelson Mandela Bay chair is perceived to be one of the proxy factional battles among the ANC s top brass.President Jacob Zuma has endorsed Lungisa as chair despite Mantashe denouncing the election, saying it broke the party s constitution.As the ANC NEC prepared to meet, Mantashe dismissed questions on whether the committee will discuss the matter. There s no individual who refers anything to the NEC. Everybody writes a letter to the office of the Secretary-General in the ANC. We process it accordingly. Lungisa is thought to be supporting Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in the ANC s leadership contest.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
