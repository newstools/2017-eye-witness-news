Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock was sent to hospital for scans on the injury to his right index finger. WELLINGTON - Quinton de Kock is a doubt for South Africa for this week's third and final Test against New Zealand after the wicketkeeper suffered a finger injury during the eight-wicket victory over the hosts last week.De Kock, whose belligerent knock of 91 in a 160-run partnership with Temba Bavuma swung the second Test at the Basin Reserve, was sent to hospital for scans on the injury to his right index finger.The 24-year-old missed training on Wednesday and team officials told reporters in Hamilton that a decision on whether he played would not be made until Friday.Uncapped Heinrich Klaasen could take the gloves for the match at Seddon Park, which starts on Saturday.South Africa lead 1-0 after their victory in Wellington and the rain forecast for the first four days of the Hamilton Test could hamper New Zealand's hopes of saving the series.
