Lindiwe Sisulu has joined the chorus of critics of the Western Cape government&#8217;s decision to continue the sale of the Tafelberg property. CAPE TOWN Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has joined the chorus of critics, of the Western Cape government s decision to continue the sale of the Tafelberg property in Sea Point.The Western Cape cabinet earlier this week, decided to allow the sale of the property to the Philis Jowell Day School to continue despite on-going protests by activists who wanted the land to be used for affordable housing.Cabinet says its decision was based on various factors, including the fact that the site did not fall within a restructuring zone, so it would not qualify for a national social subsidy.Sisulu's spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya says the minister does not agree with the decision, especially since national government is in the process of redefining restructuring zones. We believe that land should be used for the benefit of the poor, there are many people who work in the City of Cape Town who have to wake up in the morning and drive and catch busses. We are going to engage with provincial government, that decision must be changed. But Western Cape human settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela says cabinet's decision was not solely based on the zones issue, but on other factors as well, including the need to find revenue for the province.Madikizela adds this decision does not involve national government. This is a decision by the Western Cape government on how best to use its assets. The land does not belong to the Human Settlements nationally this decision has nothing to do with them.
