The party&#8217;s legal commission has been investigating Helen Zille for allegedly breaching the DA&#8217;s constitution for tweeting that colonialism was not only negative. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) s Federal Executive Committee is expected to announce this week whether it will take action against Western Cape Premier Helen Zille. The party s legal commission has been investigating Zille for allegedly breaching the DA s constitution for tweeting that colonialism was not only negative. Leader Mmusi Maimane had earlier distanced the party from the comments.Zille has met with the Western Cape caucus where concerns about her statements were raised. It is still unclear if any decision into her conduct was reached following Sunday s Federal Executive Committee meeting with no word from the party yet. Political commentator Somadoda Fikeni says given the long engagements in this matter, disciplinary measures against Zille may not include her stepping down as Western Cape Premier. I doubt it will lead to either an outright disciplinary action or her suspension or expulsion. At the same time, the Black First Land First (BLF) movement says it has opened a crimen injuria case at the Hillbrow Police Station against Zille. BLF says Zille has unlawfully and intentionally impaired the dignity of blacks and increased the collective pain caused by colonialism. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
