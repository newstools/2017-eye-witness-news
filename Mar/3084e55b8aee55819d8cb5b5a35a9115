ANC veteran Wally Serote said in their meeting with the ANC last week, veterans were shocked to hear the party deny ever agreeing to hold a consultative conference. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts say they are planning to meet with the party s leadership again this week to clarify whether or not the ANC was serious last week when it said it never agreed to hold a consultative conference.The stalwarts are accusing the party of making an about turn on the issue of the conference.Last year, the ANC national executive committee resolved that the June policy conference would be extended to include a consultative conference after a request from the veterans.But the group rejected this, saying they want the two gatherings to be separated.It was in November last year when the ANC resolved to hold the consultative conference during the policy gathering in June.But according to the stalwarts, the party has changed its tune, and now says the first two days of the policy conference will not be a consultative conference as previously agreed, but merely two days to deal with concerns the stalwarts have.ANC veteran Wally Serote says they are disappointed by the party s sudden change of plans. Their side is that the thing is back-to-back for two days and our position is that delinking. The stalwarts will now need to decide if they agree to the ANC s new proposal or simply not take part in it. Serote said in their meeting with the ANC earlier this week, veterans were shocked to hear the party deny ever agreeing to hold a consultative conference. It was a shock to hear implications of that nature, there is no eye-to-eye on that matter. But ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa refuted that the party has gone back on its word, suggesting it was the stalwarts who did not want to agree to the ANC s terms of the gathering.The stalwarts are adamant the gathering must be separate from the policy conference.Meanwhile, Kodwa has confirmed that ANC branches initially rejected the proposal to hold the conference.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
