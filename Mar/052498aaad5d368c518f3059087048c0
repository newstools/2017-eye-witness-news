LONDON - Hours after thousands of Londoners gathered in Trafalgar Square, news broke that a 75-year-old man injured in the Westminster terror attack has died. This brings the total number of victims to four, including a police officer and excluding the attacker, who was shot dead outside parliament. The killer has been named as Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British born man who was known to MI5, and had a string of previous run-ins with the law. In Trafalgar Square, defiant words were met with applause. When Londoners face adversity, we always pull together. People have tried to pull this city apart with acts of terror many times, they have never succeeded and they never will... The terrorist will not defeat us; we will defeat them. Police say the latest victim had been on life support which was switched off on Thursday night. Isis has claimed responsibility, while eight suspects have been arrested. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
