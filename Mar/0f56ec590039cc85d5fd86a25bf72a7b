Nhleko emphasised that bail is a Constitutional right but questioned the release of violent suspects. CAPE TOWN - Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has suggested a section of the criminal justice system is lenient on suspected criminals, often releasing them on bail.Briefing Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Police on quarterly crime stats for 2016, Nhleko told Members of Parliament (MPs) they often face backlash during community meetings about accused persons being let out by courts.Nhleko emphasised he was not particularly against bail because it's a Constitutional right but questioned the release of violent suspects.He says it used to be difficult for people to be released on bail. One of the strange development is that it s almost a guarantee that one will get bail, regardless of the severity of the crime committed. He adds the issue needs to be addressed by the criminal justice cluster. It s absolutely to the benefit of no one to have such a situation continue in this manner and then fester instability in our communities. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
