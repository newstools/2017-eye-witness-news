It&#8217;s emerged President Jacob Zuma will seek to intervene in the case brought by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan against Gupta-owned companies. PRETORIA It s emerged President Jacob Zuma has entered the fray and will seek to intervene in the case brought by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan against Gupta-owned companies. The High Court in Pretoria is expected to hear the minister s application on Tuesday, to have the court declare that he has no authority to intervene in the Guptas' fight with the banks. Between December 2015 and April last year, the country s big four banks cut ties with Gupta-owned companies, citing reputational risk.Gordhan approached the courts when the companies asked him to intervene in the dispute. Zuma has taken issue with the relief sought by Standard Bank, which seeks protection from interference from the national executive, including Cabinet and the president. Zuma s attorney argues in papers that this is an attempt to get the court to prevent the president and Cabinet from exercising their executive powers.The president wants Standard Bank s application struck from the roll. Meanwhile, Gupta-owned Sahara Computers filed fresh papers on Monday in which it disputes the authority of the state attorney to represent Gordhan. The company has argued that Gordhan is using the courts to shield the banks from oversight and accountability.The court will first have to deal with Zuma s application and the late filing of papers by Sahara before it gets to hear the minister s case.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
