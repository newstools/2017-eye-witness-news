Spokesperson Molaodi Wa Sekake also says the ANC must bury their heads in shame for allowing Brian Molefe to ascend to Parliament. JOHANNESBURG The Young Communist League (YCL) has come out in defence of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan amid calls for him to be axed, while lashing out at the African National Congress (ANC) for appointing Brian Molefe to Parliament.The league held a briefing yesterday following their political commission meeting over the weekend.Some ANC structures have called for Gordhan s head, claiming he s failed to transform state-owned enterprises and deal strictly with the banks implicated in the currency trade collusion.The same structures have expressed their support for Molefe, saying he is a competent professional who is also ready to be deployed in government. YCL spokesperson Molaodi Wa Sekake says the ANC must bury their heads in shame for allowing Molefe to ascend to Parliament. The appointment of Brian Molefe to Parliament is a reflection of the rot in the ANC because there are so many people who deserve to be in Parliament. And therefore, his appointment to Parliament as a public representative is smack in the face of South African people. Meanwhile, the ANC in the North West said it has handed over issues around Molefe s membership to the national leadership.This comes as FNB said it cannot confirm or deny if it has suspended one of its employees over a deposit slip linked to Molefe.Last month, ANC leaders in Madibeng produced Molefe s paid membership application forms from 2011 to 2015 as evidence that he had been a member in ward 29, while another ANC branch in Pretoria claimed him.One of the documents produced by ANC members during a media briefing showed a bank stamp, which reflected the back office, instead of a teller number. This prompted FNB to investigate Molefe s membership form.ANC North West spokesperson Dakalo Legoete said the issue is now with the party s secretary general Gwede Mantashe.The ANC said it will meet with FNB to seek clarity on its investigation into the authenticity of Molefe s membership.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
