Disaster management say a rock fall inside the shaft has now blocked off the path they were using to send down a drone to locate five-year-old Richard Thole. JOHANNESBURG Efforts to rescue a five-year-old boy who fell into a disused mine shaft in Boksburg have hit yet another setback.Disaster emergency management services say a rock fall inside the shaft has now blocked off the path they were using to send down a drone to locate Richard Thole.Operations were suspended on Tuesday due to unstable ground.Ekurhuleni disaster emergency management's William Ntladi says rescuers worked throughout the night excavating the top soil to ensure the surface was stable again.But he says when they sent their drone down the shaft to search for the boy on Wednesday morning, the open path they were using closed down as rocks fell. Now, as we put the camera in, it cannot go beyond those rocks. Ntladi says they re looking for other routes in. Because the shaft is quite big, we re trying to use the other side. The Economic Freedom Fighters is blaming mining companies for this incident saying they leave open holes where they once mined which now serve as graves.WATCH: #BoksburgMine: Search for Richard Thole (5) continues(Edited by Tamsin Wort)
