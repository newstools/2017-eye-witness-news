Khanyile has been in jail for five months now for allegedly inciting violence and damaging property at the Durban University of Technology. JOHANNESBURG Lawyers representing Bonginkosi Khanyile have argued that denying the #FeesMustFall activist bail is not in the interests of justice and there s been a misinterpretation of parts of the law.Khanyile has been in jail for five months now for allegedly inciting violence and damaging property at the Durban University of Technology.The Supreme Court dismissed Khanyile s application for leave to appeal saying his release would interrupt the proper proceeding of the criminal justice system.He s already been denied bail three timesChief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng began proceedings by asking Khanyile s lawyers to explain why this matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court.Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi has argued that the lower courts have misinterpreted Section 60, Subsection 4, of the Criminal Procedures Act, and this approach has been divorced from Section 35 of the Constitution.This, he says, makes Khanyile s continued detention against the interests of justice.The justices have questioned Ngcukaitobi about how different this case is to that of activist Mcebo Dlamini where the Constitutional Court found that there had been a misapplication of the law.Dlamini was in court on Wednesday morning. He could be seen wearing African National Congress regalia and listening attentively to the proceedings.Meanwhile, dozens of Economic Freedom Fighters supporters are demonstrating outside the court.(Edited by Tamsin Wort)
