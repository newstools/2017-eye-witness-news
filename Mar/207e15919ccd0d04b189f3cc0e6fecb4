HARARE - A court in Zimbabwe has stopped the eviction of villagers from a farm north of Harare that s reported to have been allocated to First Lady Grace Mugabe.

High Court Judge Felistus Chatukuta has ordered the police not to evict the villagers until the government has found alternative land for them. The villagers have been on Arnold Farm in Mazowe, north of Harare, since 2000.The state Herald newspaper says land in Mazowe has been allocated to the first lady, but lawyers haven't confirmed this.Rights lawyer Moses Nkomo says some of the villagers who had property destroyed by armed police earlier this week will now sue for compensation.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
