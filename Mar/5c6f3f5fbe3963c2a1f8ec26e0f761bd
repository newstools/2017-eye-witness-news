About 1,500 miners out of the 4,700 went on strike at the Kusasalethu Mine in Carletonville on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG Harmony Gold has urged all its employees to report for work on Friday morning to avoid suspension and even dismissal.About 1,500 miners out of the 4,700 went on strike at the Kusasalethu Mine in Carletonville on Thursday.The mine says the strike is illegal and those, who do not report for work will not be paid.Earlier this week seven miners were suspended for organising the strike at the mine.Harmony Gold s Marian van der Walt says while they are talking to the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) about the strike, those who do not arrive for work will face disciplinary action. People participating in an illegal strike would obviously be subject to disciplinary action and that certainly could result in possible dismissal. If they re not at work, they won t be paid. She says a memorandum has not been submitted to mine management. We ve not received any demands. This could be a response to the fact that we ve taken disciplinary action against the employees who instigated the illegal sit-in earlier this year. A meeting was held between management and Amcu on Thursday.Amcu management is yet to comment.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
