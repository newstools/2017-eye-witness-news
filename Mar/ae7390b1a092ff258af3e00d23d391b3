The court wants to know when Sassa knew that it wouldn&#8217;t be able to take over the payment process and why it wasn&#8217;t informed. JOHANNESBURG - There is still no clarity at this hour on whether the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the Social Development Department have met the 4pm deadline to submit details to the Constitutional Court about the contract to pay social grants.The highest court in the land asked for clarity on the contract between Sassa and service provider Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) after it had declared that contract invalid in 2014.The court wants to know when Sassa knew that it wouldn t be able to take over the payment process and why it wasn t informed of this fact immediately.While there is no immediate official confirmation that the deadline has been met, several sources have told Eyewitness News Sassa has not filed its papers on time.Black Sash, which has also approached the Constitutional Court, says it has not received any communication suggesting Sassa's lawyers have filed papers.There has been no official statement from the court. Sassa had five days to answer 17 questions, including when it knew it wouldn t be able to take over the payment process from CPS and whether there is a new agreement with the company.The matter will be heard on Wednesday which is why the court wanted answers to these crucial questions beforehand.At the same time, the Mail &amp; Guardian is reporting that cabinet ministers have reportedly thrown out the deal negotiated between Sassa and CPS which is supposed to guarantee the payment of social grants by 1 April.The paper has reported that a task team headed by Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, decided last week that the current negotiations with CPS should be terminated and fresh negotiations should start, only if and when Treasury has approved it.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
