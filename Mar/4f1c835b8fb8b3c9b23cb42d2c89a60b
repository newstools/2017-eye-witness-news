Business Leadership South Africa says Jacob Zuma's failure to explain why he ordered Pravin Gordhan back home raises concerns. JOHANNESBURG - Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) says without a proper explanation from President Jacob Zuma as to why he ordered Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan back from London, it's hard not to believe he has put his own agenda ahead of the best interests of the country.It also says Zuma's failure to explain himself will raise concerns from ratings agencies that the economy has become a pawn of political in-fighting.The organisation s deputy chair Bonang Mohale says they do accept the Zuma has the power to hire and fire ministers, but he says that does not mean he can do what he likes.&quot;It s not the president s prerogative to expose the country to more deleterious effects where the rating agencies might actually review our rating to below investment grade.&quot;And he says this current situation is intolerable. Where we are seeming to be hell bent to cut our own nose, to spite our face, and we continuously score these own goals.&quot;The group also says Gordhan has provided exemplary leadership at the National Treasury.(Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
