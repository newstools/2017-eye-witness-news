LONDON - Former British prime minister Tony Blair has denied he has been pitching to become a Middle East envoy for US President Donald Trump. The British media has been reporting he has met a key advisor of Trump s three times in the last six months to discuss working for the American administration. When Blair stepped down as UK prime minister in 2007, he became the Middle East envoy for the Quartet Group, composed of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the US. It was a role he held for eight years. His office says he is continuing to work for peace in a private capacity but has dismissed claims he has made a pitch to Trump to work for him as a peace envoy. His denial follows claims the former British prime minister met the president's son-in-law and key adviser, Jared Kushner, at the White House last week.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
