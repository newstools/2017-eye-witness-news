In a leaked letter, the municipality's deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani accuses mayor Athol Trollip of being an autocratic and stubborn leader. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) and United Democratic Movement (UDM) have played down suggestions that their coalition government in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro is on the rocks.In a leaked letter, the municipality's deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani accuses mayor Athol Trollip of being an autocratic and stubborn leader who disregards advice.This led to what some have described as crisis talks , with national leaders marking the second time they've had to intervene in a dispute between the metro's political executive.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa has told Eyewitness News it's not the moment to press the panic button just yet.He's confirmed contents of Bobani's letter but says the pair was told to resolve their differences.Holomisa says the disagreements which were mostly over the appointment of senior officials were discussed at a meeting last week.The MP adds he and DA leader Mmusi Maimane advised Bobani and Trollip to follow procedure when hiring.Both parties have re-iterated the coalition government which also includes the ACDP and Cope remains strong.
