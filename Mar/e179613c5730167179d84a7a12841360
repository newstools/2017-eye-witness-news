The EC provincial executive committee this week ordered him to resign as Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson by the end of Thursday or face disciplinary action. CAPE TOWN African National Congress (ANC) Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson Andile Lungisa wants the party s NEC to make a ruling on his matter before deciding if he ll to step down. The Eastern Cape provincial executive committee this week ordered Lungisa to resign by the end of Thursday or face disciplinary action.This follows a similar directive by the ANC national leadership which pointed out that the party s constitution prohibits Lungisa, who is a PEC member, from contesting elections is a lower structure. It's understood that at a meeting with the PEC on Monday, Lungisa wanted the NEC to intervene.Provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane says his refusal to vacate is still baffling. All other members comply with the counseling and guidance given by the national executive and we don t understand why it s going to be a new matter all of a sudden. He s got the rightin the ANC to argue his point. Mabuyane adds the PEC wants to put the matter to bed. It s been almost two weeks now, discussing this matter. It brings an unnecessary negativity on the ANC s integrity, as if the centre of the ANC itself can t hold and we don t think it s the correct way to go on.
