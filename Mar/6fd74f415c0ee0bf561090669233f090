The Finance Minister says he will return to South Africa as he had been planning to do so anyway before the order by President Zuma. LONDON/JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Monday he had not been recalled to South Africa by President Jacob Zuma, but &quot;asked to come back home&quot; and had been planning to do so anyway.The Presidency said in a statement on Monday that President Jacob Zuma had instructed his Finance Minister to return immediately from an investor roadshow to Britain and the United States, without giving a reason for the decision.Gordhan, asked by Reuters on the sidelines of investor meetings if he would return said &quot;yes&quot;, adding he had not planned to be part of the US leg of the investor roadshow anyway.He declined comment on reasons for his recall and, asked if he expected a Cabinet reshuffle, said: &quot;That's the boss' prerogative.&quot;A South African delegation was due to hold meetings in London on Monday and Tuesday, then Boston on Wednesday and New York on Thursday and Friday.While the exact reasons for the order to return are still unclear, it has led to fresh speculation that there may be a Cabinet reshuffle.
