JOHANNESBURG - Half-centuries from Dean Elgar and Faf du Plessis allowed the Standard Bank Proteas to grind themselves into a position of nominal control on the fourth day of the first Test against New Zealand at the University Oval.The pair were forced to battle in frigid conditions on a wearing wicket that made run-scoring extremely difficult, and their 80-run stand for the fourth wicket helped South Africa close the day on 224 for six, giving them a lead of 191 runs. The pedestrian scoring rate on the day, which yielded 186 runs from 84 overs, was largely due to the slow pace of the wicket as well as the unpredictable bounce. Elgar was at the crease for 87 overs for his 89, which took his match aggregate to 229 runs. This made him the first Proteas opener to score more than 200 runs in a Test since Graeme Smith struck a double-hundred against Pakistan in Dubai in November 2013. #CSAnews @DeanElgar, @faf1307 keep Proteas in control https://t.co/Pot0jPmEjn pic.twitter.com/myzSGmMYT9Meanwhile, Du Plessis was equally patient as he batted through to stumps on 56 from 155 deliveries, ensuring that the Proteas still have control over how the last day may play out. Any target over 200 is likely to prove difficult to chase, particularly if New Zealand have to score at four or more per over to do so. With rain forecast at various points on day five, judging the state of the game and deciding on tactics could be challenging for both sides. Play on day four was delayed by around 40 minutes by early morning rain and bad light, and once play got underway, the difficulty of the day ahead was highlighted by the first two balls from Trent Boult.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
