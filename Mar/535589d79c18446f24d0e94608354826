Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor has recently raised concerns over how some government officials sustain their lifestyles. JOHANNESBURG - Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor says the African National Congress will be able to regain its credibility as soon as lifestyle audits on public servants are implemented.Pandor has recently raised concerns over how some government officials sustain their lifestyles.Last year, the ANC national executive committee resolved to conduct lifestyle audits to prove its commitment to rooting out corruption. Pandor says the details of how this policy would be implemented have not been thrashed out. The longer we delay this, the longer we face the challenge of not being credible with respect to our decisions. I think what would happen in an audit of this nature is that it will go well beyond the declarations we do submit. LISTEN: Minister Naledi Pandor calls for action on ANC lifestyle auditsMPs declare financial interestsLast month, Parliament s Ethics Committee released its annual register of financial interests of parliamentarians.The committee met earlier in February and unanimously adopted the register of members interests for 2016/2017.Members of Parliament (MPs) have to declare their financial interests and gifts they ve received.While some declarations were minutely detailed, others were surprisingly scant.A number of MPs have received free tickets to the annual Cape Town Jazz Festival and other gifts declared range from a pair of socks to a Persian rug.In terms of financial interests, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa declared shares worth more than R132 million.He also owns 32 properties and is a director of a number of companies including meat abattoirs, two local McDonalds franchises and a charity trust.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has supplied a detailed list of shares he owns, which includes real estate investments.Meanwhile, many of the Economic Freedom Fighters MPs including Julius Malema opted not to disclose much, except the fact that he has got interests in four family trusts.He, however, does not attach any monetary value to the trusts.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
