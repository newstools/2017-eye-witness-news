Viewer ratings have soared for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; since Baldwin started portraying Trump in a series of skits. LOS ANGELES Actor Alec Baldwin said that his impersonation of United States (US) President Donald Trump on NBC's sketch show Saturday Night Live has revived his &quot;dead&quot; comedy career after he wrapped up sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; in 2012.&quot;I didn't realise in the comedy terms that I was dead,&quot; Baldwin told Reuters on Monday when asked if he felt he was entering a new era with his comedy.&quot;Maybe I was in a coma ... now I'm waking up from a coma and now I'm ready to do some comedy.&quot;The actor was promoting his latest film, DreamWorks' animated comedy The Boss Baby, out in theatres on 31 March, in which he voices a suit-wearing baby manager of a corporation for babies who is adopted by a family to undertake a covert mission.It has been nearly five years since Baldwin, 58, concluded his six-year tenure as the charming corporate boss Jack Donaghy in NBC's quirky comedy series 30 Rock.Since then, he has appeared in a handful of movies in supporting roles, but the actor saw a new surge in popularity when he took over as Trump on Saturday Night Live (SNL) last October, ahead of November's US presidential elections.Baldwin quipped that his comedy career &quot;did die&quot; but that &quot;I'm being reincarnated. As Trump! Oh God!&quot;Viewer ratings have soared for Saturday Night Live since Baldwin started portraying Trump in a series of skits mocking the billionaire reality TV star-turned-politician as a dim-witted commander-in-chief with a short attention span, an oversized-ego and a Twitter addiction.Trump criticised the NBC show in December, calling it &quot;totally unwatchable&quot; and a &quot;hit-job.&quot;Asked whether he felt playing the president took a toll on him, Baldwin said the challenge of the role was that it would &quot;delight some people and offend other people.&quot;&quot;A large plurality of the country voted for Trump as president, and I think many of them are people that are not fond of the way Trump is treated, not just by Saturday Night Live but the comedy cosmos in general,&quot; he said.&quot;I think for me playing Trump has been, it's been a fun experience because it's like going home when I do SNL.&quot;
