If you remove a school door, you are not cheating a family of five, like if you remove a door of a family house you are cheating generations. It should be seen in that light. She says those who vandalise school infrastructure should be dealt with harshly. We agreed that we are going to get the criminal system to criminalise, quite harshly, the vandalism of schools.
