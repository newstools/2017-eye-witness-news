I can confirm that I opened criminal charges at the Brooklyn Police Station in Pretoria. I ve received a case number and I hope the police will get to the bottom of this case. He might be having a fake name or it might be his real name but we cannot sit back and allow this hatred and this incitement to violence to continue.
