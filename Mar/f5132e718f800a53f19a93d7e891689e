He also met with two rating agencies.He also said he follows the instructions of the President.&quot;The President is my boss, so if he says come back, we come back.&quot;When asked about whether he knew about reports that he could be fired, Gordhan didn't say much: &quot;Let's wait and see.&quot;Gordhan said it was too soon for him to comment on a possible Cabinet reshuffle, which could see him vacate his position in the Treasury.He did, however, address concerns raised by business, investors and the public about why he was suddenly called back home. South Africans should be assured that there are many in government who want to do the right things and make sure that we keep our economy on track. It's unclear whether Gordhan will have any meetings with the Presidency.The finance minister said the purpose of the trip was to keep South Africa's good name, which was of benefit to all citizens.
