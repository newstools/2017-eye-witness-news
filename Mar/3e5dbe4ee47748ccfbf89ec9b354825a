JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has lashed out at Judge Dennis Davis, saying all they expected from him was to focus on the duties he s being paid for and steer clear of politics.On Friday Sars released a statement calling on the judge to recuse himself from the tax committee, saying they have lost confidence in him.The revenue service has accused the judge of being part of an effort to undermine its leadership in order to plunge it into crisis of illegitimacy.Sars spokesperson Luther Lebelo said, Judge Davis has been appointed by the minister in terms of Section 11 to advise both the minister and the commissioner of Sars. All we expected from him, at least for the money we re paying him, is to give advice. But Judge Davis says he doesn t even get paid to chair the committee. I don t get any money at all for doing this job. I do this job as a judge and I don t get an additional cent, because I was asked by the minister to chair the committee, and my interests are only in ensuring that we have a better system of administration and policy.
