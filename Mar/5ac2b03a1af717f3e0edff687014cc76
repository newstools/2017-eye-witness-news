The Public Enterprises Minister says the state-owned enterprises that fall under her department are helping grow the economy. CAPE TOWN - Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown says the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that fall under her department are helping grow the economy and are not a drain on state coffers.Brown is briefing Parliament s public enterprises committee on the performance of SOEs.Those that fall under her department include Eskom, Transnet, Denel, regional airline SA Express and Safcol.Brown says while some of them face challenges, they are able to raise funds in South Africa and abroad at competitive rates. The analysis of the performance of SOEs clearly shows that these companies are contributing positively to the South African economy and they re advancing the developmental obligations of the state. All the state-owned companies within my portfolio have continued to operate and meet the mandates that they were established for. Members of Parliament (MPs) are expected to grill Brown about the damning Denton report on Eskom, as well as former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
