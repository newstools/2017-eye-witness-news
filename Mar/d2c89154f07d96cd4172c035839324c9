The Arsenal boss has described as &quot;completely false&quot; claims the Chilean recently clashed with his team-mates. LONDON - Reports of a training ground bust-up between Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez and his Arsenal team mates are &quot;completely false&quot;, manager Arsene Wenger said on Monday.&quot;I m not aware. Nothing happened. Nothing at all,&quot; the Frenchman told reporters ahead of Arsenal's Champions League last 16 second-leg match against Bayern Munich at the Emirates on Tuesday.&quot;(The media reports are) completely false. But I understand that you have to fill the newspapers and we respect that,&quot; added Wenger.Reports in Monday's papers said Sanchez was dropped from the starting line-up for Saturday's 3-1 Premier League defeat at Liverpool after the 28-year-old allegedly rowed with the manager and team mates.Wenger brought on the Chilean at halftime with Arsenal, who are now out of the top four in the Premier League, 2-0 down at Anfield.&quot;I explained after the game at Liverpool that I decided to go for a more direct option in the game and that's what happened. That was the unique reason for my decision,&quot; said Wenger of his tactics.&quot;For the rest, his attitude...He is a committed player, sometimes with excessive behaviour, but you have seen that many times in history in every squad.&quot;Responding to questions about Sanchez's future at Arsenal, with mounting speculation that the player could leave at the end of the season in a big-money transfer, Wenger said it would be the club that decided.&quot;Alexis Sanchez has 15 months on his contract so the decision will depend completely on Arsenal football club, not anyone else,&quot; he said, describing his relationship with the forward as &quot;honest and normal like with every player&quot;.The manager added that the most important thing was to perform as a team.&quot;Players at that level are proven but football is not about one player, it's much bigger than that,&quot; he said.Sanchez, Arsenal's top scorer with 17 league goals this season, trained with the rest of the players at London Colney on Monday and was photographed shaking Wenger's hand.Arsenal were trounced 5-1 by Bayern in the away leg and will have to produce the biggest second-leg comeback in a Champions League knockout tie to avoid a seventh successive exit at the last-16 stage.
