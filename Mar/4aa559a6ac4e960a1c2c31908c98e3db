President Jacob Zuma has applied for a judicial review of the state of capture report compiled by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. CAPE TOWN - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says her affidavit relating to President Jacob Zuma s application for a judicial review of the state of capture report will be ready soon.Zuma is asking the court to review former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s recommendation that there be a judicial commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture.Madonsela said in her report that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should appoint the judge to lead the inquiry.Mkhwebane says she s received a legal opinion from private counsel on Zuma s court challenge. I think before the end of the month we will be lodging our responding affidavit. Remember, the very same process needs to go back to the president as the applicant so he can also file a supplementary affidavit. It s still a process. Mkhwebane would not be drawn on the legal opinion, except to say it deals with the Constitution s stipulation that the president is the person who can appoint a judicial commission of inquiry.She says should the court find in Zuma s favour, the question will then be whether her office has the resources to carry out the investigation.Earlier she told MPs her budget of just over R300 million for the year needed to be boosted to at least R1 billion.
