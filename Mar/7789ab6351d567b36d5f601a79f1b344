Late last year, the ANC NEC resolved that the June policy conference would be extended to include a consultative conference. JOHANNESBURG - A group of African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts has accused the party of making an about turn, with the party claiming it never agreed to hold a consultative conference.Late last year, the ANC national executive committee (NEC) resolved that the June policy conference would be extended to include a consultative conference after a request from the veterans.The stalwarts have been pushing for a separate consultative conference to be held before the policy conference, saying they want the gathering to look at organisational issues and assess the state of the party.ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe three months ago confirmed that the party had agreed to hold a consultative conference. The first two days of the conference will be utilised to assess the state of the organisation as envisaged in the veterans call for a consultative conference. But following a meeting between the ANC stalwarts and the party s NEC earlier this week, it seems the tables have turned.ANC stalwart Wally Serote said: The NEC has actually backed off from the national consultative conference agreements which will be most unfortunate. The veterans previously rejected the ANC s suggestion for the conference to be held during the policy conference, while the party also rejected the proposal for the conference to be delinked from the policy gathering.
