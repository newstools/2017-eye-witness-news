The RTMC wants the company to surrender all access codes, keys and data necessary to access the premises and operate eNatis. PRETORIA The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) will on Thursday ask the High Court to compel private company Tasima to hand over control of the eNatis traffic management database. The Transport Department won a Constitutional Court challenge in November which gave the company 30 days to transfer the system to the care of the RTMC but this hasn t happened.The RTMC will also seek a contempt order against Tasima management when the matter is heard in the High Court in Pretoria.The RTMC will be asking the court to have Tasima vacate the premises from which they operate the eNatis system and hand over full control of it.It wants the company to surrender all access codes, keys and data necessary to access the premises and operate eNatis. The RTMC argues that if they fail to vacate within 24 hours of the order being handed down, the court should then empower the Minister of Police or the sheriff to evict them from the premises.The corporation also wants Tasima and its managers to explain why they should not be held in contempt of court for not executing the Constitutional Court order handed down in November.It accuses the company of imposing unlawful and unreasonable preconditions to transfer control of the system.
