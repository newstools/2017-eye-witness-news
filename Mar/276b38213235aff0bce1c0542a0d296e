CAPE TOWN - Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform Gugile Nkwinti says he has no idea why President Jacob Zuma abruptly recalled Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan from an international investor roadshow in London.Nkwinti says he heard the news on the radio. I was driving from Pretoria to the airport in Joburg and was listening to the news, I heard it over the radio. I don t know what the motivation behind that is at all. I have no idea. He says for Zuma to have acted in this way means the matter must be serious. I don t have the detail of that thing and I m speaking the truth here ladies and gentlemen, and I don t have the details of that at all. I will follow it through and check what s going on there. I don t know what prompted the president to call a minister from a conference as important as that. It must be a serious matter. Nkwinti says he s also aware of the court case involving Gordhan and the Guptas.On Tuesday, the president s legal team abandoned its attempt to intervene in the Finance Minister s court application against Gupta-owned companies.Gordhan approached the courts when the companies asked him to intervene in a dispute with the country s banks.Between December 2015 and April last year, the country s big four banks cut ties with Gupta-owned companies, citing reputational risk.The president wanted Standard Bank s application, which seeks protection from interference from the national executive, including Cabinet and the president, struck from the roll.However, Judge President Dunstan Mlambo told the president s legal team that he had not formally applied to intervene and the court would not consider him a party before the court.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
