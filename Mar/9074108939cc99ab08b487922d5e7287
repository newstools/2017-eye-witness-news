The High Court has also ruled that a state attorney can represent Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in his legal battle with the Guptas. PRETORIA - The High Court in Pretoria has ruled that a state attorney can represent Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in his legal battle with the Guptas and has granted Oakbay s application on a Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) report.Gordhan approached the court to have it declare that he does not have the power to intervene in the fight between Gupta-owned companies and the banks, after the country s big four banks closed the Guptas business accounts, citing reputational risk.The Finance Minister included the FIC report in his application which shows 60 suspicious transactions linked to Gupta-owned companies. This effectively means that Gordhan can place no reliance on the FIC certificate.Meanwhile, Sahara Computers questioned the authority of the state attorney to represent Gordhan, but the court has denied its application to have the minister present in court.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
