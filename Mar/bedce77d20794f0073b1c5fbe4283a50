WATCH: Roof collapse at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital injures 5  A partial roof collapse at the hospital has raised questions about the apparent failure by officials to heed numerous warnings about structural weaknesses and defects at the facility, placing lives at risk. Five people were injured when a section of the roof caved in while contractors were working on it. Doctors shared several complaints on condition of anonymity. They said that water seeped through the ceiling in the theatre complex, forcing closures, faeces had leaked into parts of the paediatric clinic, the cooling systems broke down and the intensive care unit had been compromised on occasion. WATCH: Gauteng Health MEC reacts to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital roof collapse  Doctors said they were angry and frustrated, adding that patients deserve much better. Two years ago, Eyewitness News revealed that a report compiled by independent consultants in 2012 had warned that the X-Ray department on the fifth floor of the hospital was at risk of collapsing. Thursday's accident occurred on the same floor but not close to the X-ray department, however, that report did note numerous concerns about the structural integrity of the entire building. At the time, the report was described as alarmist. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
