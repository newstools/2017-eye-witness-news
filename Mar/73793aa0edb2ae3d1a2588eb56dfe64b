CAPE TOWN - South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Acting CEO James Aguma has rubbished claims the public broadcaster disrespects the law.He was among the SABC staff appearing before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts earlier on Wednesday.Committee members have grilled them over irregular expenditure amounting to R5.1 billion dating back to 2014.MP Mnyami Booi has echoed the concerns stated in the report by the Auditor General. The Auditor General stated that the SABC doesn t respect the law and doesn t follow legislation. How are you (SABC) going to solve this problem because you have no regard for the law, as an institution? But Aguma has denied this: I would hesitate to agree with the agency that says we don t respect the law. One of the first things that we did was to ensure that the policies and procedures are in line with the law. Committee chair Themba Godi says it needs to be understood in context. The public broadcaster doesn t have a culture of people following the prescripts of the law. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
