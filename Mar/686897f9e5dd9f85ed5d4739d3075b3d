The Democratic Alliance is expected to file an urgent application for a court interdict at the High Court in the Western Cape. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) is expected to file an urgent application for a court interdict at the High Court in the Western Cape on Friday to stop the swearing-in of new ministers and their deputies.President Jacob Zuma reshuffled his Cabinet with Pravin Gordhan and his former deputy Mcebisi Jonas among those fired. DA leader Mmusi Maimane says Zuma's actions can only be described as treason. It is Parliament that appoints the president and it should be Parliament that fires the president. All of us must gather in the city of Johannesburg and call on the ANC to join in this action, to remove Jacob. Maimane has called on all South Africans to join the party in a mass march on the African National Congress headquarters next week Friday.ALL WELCOME: We will lead a march to #LuthuliHouse (Friday 7 April) calling on the ANC to support our Motion of #NoConfidence in Zuma! pic.twitter.com/YjqtXNzIZhThe DA also wants Baleka Mbete, the Speaker of Parliament, to convene an urgent sitting so that the House can argue a motion of no confidence in Zuma.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
