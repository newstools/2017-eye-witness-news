The Agricultural Business Chamber says this will further spur on a decline in food prices. CAPE TOWN - South Africa s maize harvest this year is forecast to be the biggest in more than 30 years. The Agricultural Business Chamber says this will further spur on a decline in food prices. The country consumes just over 10 million tonnes of maize per year, exporting the rest. The Agricultural Business Chamber s Wandile Sihlobo says this, coupled with better weather conditions, could deliver South Africa's best harvest since 1980. The total maize expected is roughly around 14.3 million tonnes. He adds this is not the only commodity with a promising harvest. Soybeans have the largest crop on record of over a million tonnes. We haven t produced anything like this. He says the attractive higher maize prices seen last year led to more of the commodity being planted.Sihlobo says the exports could be used to assist other African countries affected by fall armyworm.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
