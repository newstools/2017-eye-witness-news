The Finance Minister has approached the High Court in Pretoria to have it rule that he&#8217;s not authorised to interfere in the Guptas' fight with the banks. JOHANNESBURG - Gupta-owned company Oakbay Investments says it has suffered unjustified and severe reputational damage as a result of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's call for them to withdraw from the application hearing in the High Court in Pretoria.Gordhan s legal team has questioned why Oakbay has not withdrawn their opposition to his court application if they genuinely agree, as they ve claimed, with the position he s taken with respect to the banks.Gordhan has approached the High Court in Pretoria to have it rule that he s not authorised to interfere in the Guptas' fight with the banks.Between December 2015 and April last year, the big four banks closed the accounts of the Gupta-owned companies, which prompted the family s request that the minister intervene.Counsel for the Oakbay group of companies told the court they don t dispute that Gordhan is not authorised to intervene in the matter with the banks.STANDARD BANK SLAMS OAKBAY COMPANIESStandard Bank has argued that the Oakbay companies preferred method of resolving its dispute with the banks is unlawful because it seeks executive intervention in the private affairs of the banks.This was among the submissions on day two of Gordhan s court action against Gupta-owned companies.Standard Bank s Advocate Vincent Maleka says there s a clear dispute between the Oakbay companies and the bank. The preferred means for the resolution of that dispute is unlawful. Fundamentally it requires the national executive to intervene in a private law relationship when it is quite clear or should be clear in a corperate group of companies that the national executive has no powers to do so.
