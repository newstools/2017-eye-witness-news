The amended Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment bill was unanimously adopted by the National Assembly on Tuesday. CAPE TOWN The African National Congress (ANC) says the amended Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) bill will be crucial in tackling money laundering and the financing of terrorism.After being referred back to Parliament by President Jacob Zuma last year, to test the constitutionality of warrantless searches, the bill was unanimously adopted by the National Assembly on Tuesday. Opposition parties slammed Zuma for wasting Parliament s time and have alleged there were ulterior motives for causing the delay.The amended bill now has tighter provisions relating to warrantless searches.Inspectors will require internal authorisation before such a search is carried out. Finance committee chairperson Yunus Carrim says: There are further provisions on the need for inspectors to conduct their inspections with due regard to people s constitutional rights, including the right to privacy. The Democratic Alliance (DA) s David Maynier says the bill will ensure prominent people are more closely scrutinised by banks. We need to see Jimmy Manyi and his band of banker bashers for what they really are; arsonists dressed as firefighters. Zuma will now consider for a second time whether or not to sign the bill into law. (Edited by Tamsin Wort)
