Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom also refused to discuss what impact there could be in the ANC&#8217;s NEC if there was a reshuffle. JOHANNESBURG - Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom says he s not letting the speculation about whether there could be a Cabinet reshuffle and whether he could lose his job affect what he s doing in office.Last week, Brian Molefe was sworn in as a Member of Parliament leading to opposition parties claiming that he was going to the Finance Ministry in a reshuffle in which Hanekom could also be fired.Last year, Hanekom proposed in an African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee meeting that they hold a vote on whether President Jacob Zuma should be recalled from the Union Buildings.That s led to claims that if there is a reshuffle, he could be fired.But Hanekom says he won t speculate on what could happen. It would just impact negatively on my work life and my professional performance if I got obsessed with all the speculation and rumours. I just have to continue doing my job to the best of my ability. Hanekom s also refused to discuss what impact there could be in the ANC s NEC if there was a reshuffle.
