Newly elected ANC Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson Andile Lungisa has indicated he wants the party&#8217;s NEC to make a ruling on the matter before deciding if he should step down. JOHANNESBURG - The Eastern Cape African National Congress (ANC) says it s looking at the party s NEC, which starts its three-day meeting on Friday morning, for direction on how to deal with the defiance of PEC member and newly elected ANC Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson Andile Lungisa.Earlier this week, the provincial party s executive committee gave Lungisa until Thursday to resign from the lower structure or face disciplinary action.But he has indicated he wants the party s NEC to make a ruling on the matter before deciding if he should step down.Lungisa accepted nomination for the position of Nelson Mandela Bay chairperson despite the party s secretary general Gwede Mantashe pointing out that the ANC constitution prohibits him from contesting the position as he is already a PEC member.Despite Mantashe making it clear to Lungisa that the party s constitution doesn t allow for higher leadership incumbents to contest positions in lower structures, Lungisa went ahead and contested the position and after victory received praise from President Jacob Zuma, who called him a man of character.The Eastern Cape ANC s spokesperson Mlibo Qoboshiyane says they hope the ANC NEC meeting this weekend will provide direction. We ve taken a decision to allow his appeal to the NEC to consider the matter. It is now up to the national structure to make a final decision on whether he should remain as the chairperson of the region.What s clear though is that ANC leaders are divided on this issue.Some NEC members sympathetic to President Zuma have told Eyewitness News they will defend Lungisa at the NEC meeting.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
