The party says the intelligence report cited by Jacob Zuma as a reason for instructing Pravin Gordhan to come home was only created to justify Zuma&#8217;s decision. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) has criticised state security organs for playing politics, saying the intelligence report that President Jacob Zuma cited as a reason for instructing the Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to come home was only created to justify Zuma s decision.The report alleges that Gordhan and his deputy planned to meet foreign businesses to discredit Zuma.The ANC s alliance partner on Thursday confirmed that Zuma informed them he would be axing both the Finance Minister and his deputy.SACP second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila says the abuse of state resources must stop. So it s corruption on steroids ... it s abuse of state organs on steroids. We have to come up and stop this absolute nonsense that is taking place. We reject that as the Communist Party. They are wasting huge resources, concerning themselves on matters that are insignificant just so that they can hype up the president s decision. (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
