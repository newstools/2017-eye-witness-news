The local currency lost around 1.7% on the news that the Finance Minister had been ordered to return from an international investor roadshow. JOHANNESBURG - The markets and rand have been under pressure following the decision to summon Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy to return home.Government bonds have extended losses and the rand dropped sharply after the news broke, with the local currency losing around 1.7%.A short while ago it was R12.57 to the dollar, R15.82 to the pound and R13.66 to the euro. There has been a steady recovery by the rand since it plunged to R16.88 to the dollar in January last year.The firing of Finance Minister Nhlanla Nene a month before sent the local currency into free-fall, with possible charges against Gordhan also affecting the rand.However, economists say confidence has been building, helping the local currency.But Nedbank economist Isaac Matshego says President Jacob Zuma s announcement had a sharp impact earlier on Monday.The banking index lost more than 10% after Nene was fired in December 2015.It lost more than 2% on Monday morning after Gordhan was told to return home.Read the Presidency's statement below: Presidency statement on Pravin Gordhan & Mcebisi Jonas by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd
