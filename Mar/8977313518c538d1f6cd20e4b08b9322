A year ago Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng made a ruling in the Nkandla matter, saying President Zuma breached the Constitution. JOHANNESBURG - Friday marks exactly one year since the scathing Constitutional Court ruling on Nkandla which found that President Jacob Zuma failed to uphold the Constitution.Twelve months later and Zuma has implemented yet another Cabinet reshuffle; one which has plunged the country into political turmoil, with a number of African National Congress (ANC) leaders and opposition parties criticising his decision, especially the firing of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.The Economic Freedom Fighters has filed an application to have the Speaker of Parliament ordered to institute impeachment or disciplinary proceedings against Zuma to be held accountable for the Nkandla scandal.Exactly a year ago, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng handed down judgment in the Nkandla matter, sayingPresident Zuma breached the Constitution. The president thus failed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. This failure is manifest from the disregard for the remedial action taken against him by the Public Protector. The Public Protector found that Zuma and his family had benefited from security upgrades to his Nkandla homestead and that he should pay back some of the money to the state.Zuma simply regarded this as a recommendation.On Friday, there was widespread shock following Zuma s unprecedented Cabinet reshuffle, with the Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa calling the decision to fire the finance minister unacceptable.WATCH: Nkandla: The ConCourt judgment summaryTo read the full judgment read out by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, click here.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
