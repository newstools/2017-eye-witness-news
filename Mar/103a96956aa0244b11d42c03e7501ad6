Sahara Computers says the Finance Minister is using the courts to wage a political battle against the president. PRETORIA - The Gupta-owned Sahara Computers has accused Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan of trying to use the courts in a political battle against President Jacob Zuma. The claims are made in supplementary heads of argument filed on Monday ahead of Gordhan s application on Tuesday in which the minister has asked the court to rule that he does not have the powers to intervene in matters between banks and their clients. The minister approached the court after the Gupta family s requests that he intervene in their battle to have South Africa s four major banks re-open their accounts. The so-called big four banks cut ties with the Gupta companies, citing associated reputational and business risk. Sahara Computers says in its fresh heads of argument that Gordhan s application is part of a political strategy to pre-empt action taken by Cabinet, and specifically President Zuma. The company refers to the proposed commission of inquiry into the banking sector, claiming Gordhan seemingly believes it will not be in South Africa s best interests if the banks are subjected to scrutiny and accountability.Sahara argues that if the court intervenes, it would put itself at the centre of a contentious political debate in which it has no role to play at this early stage.
