Molefe's attorney says appointing an interim board would unlawfully pre-empt the judgment, amounting to structural contempt. PRETORIA - Transport Minister Dipuo Peters says she considers a letter from former the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board chairman Popo Molefe s lawyers, warning her not to appoint an interim board, as unsolicited legal advice. Peters made the comment after announcing an interim board in Pretoria on Monday, having dissolved the management team led by Molefe last week. Molefe has launched an urgent application in the High Court in Pretoria to have that decision declared unlawful and invalid. His attorney says, in a letter to Minister Peters office, appointing an interim board would unlawfully pre-empt the judgment and the order of the court which would amount to structural contempt. Peters has disregarded the warning. Advice is advice. You either take it or you don t. And in any case in the instance of this legal advice, I would treat it as unsolicited advice. Acting director general Mathabatha Mokonyama further clarified that there is no court order or interdict prohibiting the minister from making the board appointments.The minister says ongoing public spats prompted her to recall Letsoalo and dissolve the Prasa board. Minister Peters says she pleaded with Letsoalo and Molefe to stop the public fights which exacerbated instability at Prasa. This unwarranted behaviour from both sides, further contributed to the irretrievable breakdown of relationship and trust between the board and the then acting group CEO. It, therefore, became unavoidable that we recall the acting group CEO for the good of the company. She says there were a litany of issues where the board was found wanting, which led to the decision to dissolve it. These included declining performance, lack of good governance and deteriorating public confidence in the board. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
