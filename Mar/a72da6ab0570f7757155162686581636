Australia &amp; China found unprecedented common ground on trade during Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's recent five-day visit, with a clear agenda of rejecting the 'America First' protectionism. SYDNEY It was almost a major faux pas in sports-mad Australia - Chinese Premier Li Keqiang arrived at an Australian Rules football match in Sydney wearing the blue, black and white scarf of interstate rival Port Adelaide Power.But Li quickly donned a red and white scarf of the hometown Sydney Swans to match that of his host, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.Li later confessed wearing both team scarves on a balmy autumn evening made him &quot;really hot&quot;, but the broad smiles of the two leaders provided a telling contrast to a bad-tempered telephone call between Turnbull and a freshly-elected Donald Trump that made international headlines.Australia and China found unprecedented common ground on trade during Li's recent five-day visit Down Under, with a clear agenda of rejecting the &quot;America First&quot; protectionism touted by the new US president.&quot;The cooperation between China and Australia showcases to the region and the world our determination to defend trade liberalisation and advocate the benefits of free trade,&quot; Turnbull told business leaders and politicians at a forum in Sydney, in comments closely echoed by Li.But growing trade ties are only one side of a delicate super-power balancing act for Australia, whose unshakeable security relationship with the United States and Western democratic values have limited how cosy it gets with China.Li, well aware of Australia's reliance on China for its economic future, used his visit to caution Australia against &quot;taking sides, as happened during the Cold War.&quot;And while Turnbull was quick to say &quot;the idea that Australia has to choose between China and the United States is not correct&quot;, some analysts disagree.&quot;The problem Australia faces is the growing tensions from China's desire for influence and that is going to mean Australia may have to choose between its two allies,&quot; said Nick Bisley, professor of international relations at Melbourne's La Trobe University.TRADING UPAfter decades of relative peace and economic growth, the Australian public appears to be slowly shifting its allegiance to China. Asked whether China or the United States was more important to Australia, respondents to a Lowy Institute poll were deadlocked - a shift from responses in favour of the United States when the same question was asked two years earlier.Trump pulled down the US shutters on trade early in his presidency, withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-member trade agreement that excluded China and was instrumental in the US &quot;pivot to Asia&quot;.Li came to Australia bearing a valuable gift to help fill that vacuum; the removal of restrictions on chilled beef exports.&quot;We've made it a priority to get access for agricultural products into China,&quot; an Australian government source told Reuters. &quot;Getting access to China for agricultural products can take years but as they get hold of more and more produce and they appreciate the quality, that opens the door for access for additional products.&quot;China bought A$150 billion ($114 billion) of Australian goods and services last year - easily its biggest trade partner.But juggling its trade and security interests will be no easy feat for Australia.The country's military and economic priorities collide in the under-developed but strategically important north. A new rotation of US marines is due to arrive shortly at a joint Australia-US base in Darwin that is a jump-off point for surveillance of the contested South China Sea.
