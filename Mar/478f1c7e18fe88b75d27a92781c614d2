Pravin Gordhan has asked judges to rule that he does not have the legal authority to intervene in the Gupta&#8217;s fight with the banks. PRETORIA - The banks supporting Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in his case against Gupta-owned companies say the companies have contradicted themselves. The minister has asked judges to rule that he does not have the legal authority to intervene in the Gupta s fight with the banks. The country s big four financial institutions cut ties with the Guptas between December 2015 and April last year, which prompted them to turn to Gordhan for help. Absa s legal team has told the court that while the Oakbay companies say they agree Gordhan cannot intervene in their dispute with the banks, they also say there is nothing wrong with asking him to intervene. Counsel has argued that it is impermissible to ask a public official to do what they are not authorised to do. Nedbank s advocate says Oakbay finds itself in a conundrum if they concede that the finance minister can t intervene, what exactly were they asking him to do? The bank submits that Oakbay asked the minister to do the very thing they concede is unlawful.Oakbay has opposed the matter on the grounds that the legal requirements for the court to issue a declaratory order have not been met.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
