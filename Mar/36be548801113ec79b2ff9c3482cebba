The DA and ANC in the Western Cape are playing a blame game over which party&#8217;s responsible for the water crisis. WESTERN CAPE LEGISLATURE - The Democratic Alliance (DA) and African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape are playing a blame game over which party s responsible for the water crisis.During a sitting of the Provincial Legislature on Thursday afternoon, both parties traded blows on the water crisis.The City of Cape Town, which apparently has enough drinking water for just over 100 days, was the centre of the discussions.The DA-led Western Cape government is still pushing for the province and the City of Cape Town to be declared a disaster area, despite Water and Sanitation Department dismissing the need.Zille says a declaration will ensure the province has funding for resources. I don t know why it should be scandalous for us to get resources to develop new water sources like cleaning desilting dams and canals. The ANC's Cameron Dugmore says the province and the city have woken up too late. And must accept responsibility for a failure to manage the water crisis facing the City of Cape Town. The Kannaland area could be the latest region in the province to be declared a disaster zone after submitting an application.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
