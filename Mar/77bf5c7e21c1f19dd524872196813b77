Because you ve got an audit committee who picks up on these things, you are not taking them seriously then you are guilty of wasteful and fruitless expenditure or those people are ineffective, inefficient, not fit for purpose, and that in its own means this is wasteful and fruitless expenditure. The SABC on Tuesday told MPs it has recorded a net loss of R411 million in the 2015/16 financial year, had a net asset position of R2.7 billion and a cash balance of R881 million.Aguma said the loss is due to many factors, including less than 3% government funding and growth in post-retirement service costs.(Edited by Tamsin Wort)
