The SABC inquiry report follows weeks of hearings, painting a bleak picture of political interference on Faith Muthambi's part. JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties are urging President Jacob Zuma to fire Communications Minister Faith Muthambi.The National Assembly is considering the final report of Parliament s inquiry into the fitness of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board to hold office.The report follows weeks of hearings that painted a bleak picture of the collapse of corporate governance at the public broadcaster under former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng and political interference on the part of Muthambi.The Democratic Alliance s Mike Waters said: The ad hoc committee found that the minister displayed incompetency in carrying out her responsibilities, in addition, the minister interfered in some of the board s decision-making processes. The report recommends that given the minister s violations, Parliament must refer these violations to the Constitution, the Privileges Act, the Executive Code of Ethics and the Broadcasting Act to the ethics committee and the Presidency for processing. In fact, we call on the president to reconsider her position on the cabinet. The Economic Freedom Fighters Fana Mokoena backed the call. We sincerely hope that the president will set aside his factional and self-enrichment interest and do the right thing for once in his life. Inquiry chairperson Vincent Smith says the appointment of an interim board needs to be expedited as soon as possible.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
