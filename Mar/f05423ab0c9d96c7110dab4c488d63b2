JOHANNESBURG - The United National Transport Union (UNTU) says it doesn t believe the newly appointed interim Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board will be able to pull the passenger rail agency out of its debt, which runs over R2 billion. Transport Minister Dipuo Peters announced the board on Monday chaired by former Sanral chief executive Nazir Alli. Peters dissolved the Prasa board last week following a spat between members and then acting CEO Collins Letsoalo who was fired for allegedly increasing his salary by 350% without approval. The transport union's Steve Harris says it's clear Peters doesn t understand the crisis on her hands. It s going to be very difficult for this board to pick up and be able to give mandate to negotiate. They are totally out of touch and I don t think any of them have any experience of what s going on within Prasa. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
