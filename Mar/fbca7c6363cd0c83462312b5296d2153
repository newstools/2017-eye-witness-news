Saps and Acsa have dodged questions on the possible links between robberies at the airport in 2016 and the latest heist. JOHANNESBURG Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and the Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) executives have dodged questions on the possible links between robberies at OR Tambo International Airport last year and the latest daring heist.The Airports Company and police held a briefing in Pretoria on Tuesday night s robbery, on Thursday.The air cargo operators committee says there were at least six such incidents at the airport last year alone. Lieutenant General Phahlane was asked what was going to change now, that wasn t addressed last year following similar robberies at the airport. We are not going to say there were no breaches in the last six months to a year those colleagues from Acsa are here, they may want to talk to that. Our focus is on this particular matter. Acsa s Bongani Maseko also skirted the issue. I think you asked about the number of crime incidents, but I think that question I can t answer because that matter lies with the police service. The police say they intend questioning their own, as well as Acsa employees, to identify those responsible.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
