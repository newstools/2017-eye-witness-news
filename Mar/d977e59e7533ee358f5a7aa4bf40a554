President Jacob Zuma appointed 10 new ministers and 10 deputies after firing 7 Cabinet members overnight. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court has dismissed the Democratic Alliance's (DA) application to halt the swearing in of new Cabinet ministers at 6pm.President Jacob Zuma has appointed 10 new ministers and 10 new deputies after firing seven cabinet members overnight - among them Finance Minister Pravin and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.The party wanted the Cabinet changes to be postponed until its motion of no confidence in Zuma is voted on in the National Assembly.Judge OL Rogers said any decision the court reached must be based on fact and not private or public perception. Rogers said the DA s application consisted of conclusions rather than facts.The judge agreed with the legal representative for the Presidency that the swearing in ceremony would not change nor have any effect on the Cabinet reshuffle.He added they did not think a proper and strong case had been brought before court on Friday.The official opposition has also written to Parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete to ask for the immediate resumption of Parliament to vote on the no confidence motion against the president next week.DA chief whip John Steenhuisen says the motion cannot wait till Parliament reconvenes in May.&quot;Parliament is charged with the oversight of the exercise of executive authority of the president.&quot;Appointing ministers and firing of other ministers is an executive authority and we believe that given the gravity of the situation it is absolutely imperative that Parliament reconvene.&quot;
