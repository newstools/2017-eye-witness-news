Today will be the second day of a briefing by Prasa and the Transport Department into the status of Metrorail. CAPE TOWN Members of Parliament (MPs) from the transport portfolio committee are demanding a new board be instated at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa).Today is the second day of a briefing by Prasa and the Transport Department into the status of Metrorail. But before MPs can get to this, they will be discussing the ongoing problems within the Prasa board and management structure.Issues surrounding former acting CEO Collins Letsoalo and the board dominated the briefing on Tuesday, with board members, Letsoalo and the Transport Department giving contradicting statements about his appointment and removal.Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP Thilivhali Mulaudzi was one of the MPs who slammed the board. There is an AG and Public Protector report on the corruption there, but the board is still intact. We don t know what their relationship is with the minister. We are saying this board must fall because they are managing trains and buses, but they re busy with the funds. Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Manny De Freitas says they will first need to establish whether the board is competent in fulfilling its duties. I think enough is enough. The money should be going to getting rail going. We need to resolve this and first ensure we have a competent board who can execute their mandate. Board members became upset following the tongue lashing from MPs, with Tefetso Phitsane inviting parliamentarians to see what the board is doing. I m saying I can invite the portfolio committee to do a site visit, sit with us and go through everything. I promise you it ll be a different ball game all together. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
