It's warning the financial shock will trigger economic weakness, which will have consequences for jobs in South Africa. JOHANNESBURG - Reaction to President Jacob Zuma s shock announcement has been pouring in on Friday afternoon.In a statement released by Standard Bank just a short while ago, the bank says it deeply regrets Zuma s decision to remove Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas from their offices.It's warning the financial shock will trigger economic weakness, which will have consequences for jobs.Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane claims he has already been contacted by African National Congress Members of Parliament, allegedly vowing to vote with the opposition for Zuma to be removed through a motion of no confidence in Parliament.The opposition will be asking the National Assembly to convene an urgent sitting to debate the matter.Maimane says Parliament must remove Zuma. In this instance, I ve already been contacted by certain ANC members saying they want to vote with us. If that action were to succeed, it would nullify the Cabinet in its entirety. On the other hand, the ANC Youth League says it is excited, happy and jubilated about the appointment of Malusi Gigaba as the new Finance Minister.The league s Njabulo Nzuza says Gordhan must not behave like a cry-baby. The problem with Pravin Gordhan is that he thinks he s the custodian of all that is correct. He must remember that he serves at the order of the president or at the will of the president.
