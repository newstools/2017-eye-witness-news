On Tuesday, Finance Minister Gordhan went straight to Luthuli House after landing in Johannesburg and then to the High Court in Pretoria. JOHANNESBURG There s still no word from the Presidency on the future of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Wednesday morning and still no explanation as to why he was ordered to return home from London in such a hurry.On Tuesday, Gordhan went straight to Luthuli House after landing in Johannesburg and then to the High Court in Pretoria.Already, several organisations have said President Jacob Zuma must not remove Gordhan from his post.Tuesday s comment by Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) general secretary Bheki Ntshalitshali that Gordhan was a brave man and a man of steel is a strong indication that they would oppose any move against him.At the same time, the South African Communist Party (SACP) has refused to confirm what they were told in their meeting with the ANC s top leaders on Monday night but it seems they would also strongly oppose any reshuffle.The stakes here are high as the SACP has several ministers in Cabinet and they could decide to resign if Gordhan goes.But the real actors here could be deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe.Their response to any reshuffle would be key to the future of Gordhan, Zuma and the ANC.INVESTOR JITTERSThe Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Limited chief executive Nicky Newton-King said a number of investors have now adopted a wait and see approach after Gordhan was instructed to return home.Newton-King, who was with Gordhan, said they managed to meet a number of investors.However, she said many are now cautious. There are really important stakeholders who said they are going to wait and see, get through the next couple of days and decide how we continue the conversation. This is extremely concerning for the country. Meanwhile, Public Service and Administration Minister Ngaoko Ramathlodi said he hopes President Zuma takes into account the wider interests of the country while making any decision about the future of Gordhan.Ramathlodi was moved from the Mineral Resources Ministry in 2015 and replaced by Mosebenzi Zwane.He said he is aware of the reports that Zuma may be moving against Gordhan. I really hope those who make decisions, [especially] the President when he makes his decisions, considers the wider interest of the country. Earlier on Tuesday, Gordhan confirmed he is still the Finance Minister but he declined to provide details about his meeting at Luthuli House earlier.The minister was speaking outside the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon, where his application related to several Gupta-owned companies was being heard.The minister said questions around why he was instructed to return home must be directed to the Presidency.Gordhan said he was at Luthuli House to &quot;have a discussion - which he did - and then he left.Speaking outside court on Tuesday afternoon, Gordhan told journalists not to believe rumours and he wouldn t be drawn on speculation about his position. If there is anything official to say, we will say it. I m still the Finance Minister and that is why I m here to listen to how the application is going end of story. When asked what was discussed at Luthuli House while he was there, he said: Must I ask you what you discussed with your employer this morning? He said he believed the case is going fairly well for now.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
