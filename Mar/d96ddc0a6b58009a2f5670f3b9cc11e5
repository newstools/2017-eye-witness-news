GRAZ The South African floor hockey team has made it from Vhembe in Limpopo to the top of the world in Austria, taking gold at this year's Special Olympics World Winter Games. After a narrow defeat to Canada-West two days prior, it came down to a match against Mexico, where they shone with a 3-2 victory. Now in the finals, the team was up against their previous opponents and victors of that bout, Canada-West, a much larger team, and the favourites for the tournament. Knowing what they were up against, the team focused their energy for the game and came out hard, scoring their first goal in the second round. South Africa kept up the pressure, and most of the game was played in Canada's half, the South African goalie only fending off a few shots on goal. It wasn't long and South Africa scored their second goal in round five. On the other side of half time, Canada needed to do something to come back soon. But they never did and South Africa put another one in the back of the net toward the end of the eighth, making it a resounding 3-0. Holding on to their lead, South Africa played a fierce and physical last round, putting two Canadian players on the ground. But time ticked over and still the Canadians failed to score. With seconds left, South Africa continued to pressure their defence, and after one final push by Canada, the crowd counting down the final seconds, it was all over. Jubilant, the South African team ran onto the pitch, jumping and shouting, meeting in a huddle and chanting.
