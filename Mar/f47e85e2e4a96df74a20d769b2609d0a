ANC stalwart Wally Serote veterans were shocked to hear the party deny ever agreeing to hold a consultative conference. JOHANNESBURG While African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts express shock and disappointment, at what they call, an about turn by the ANC over the consultative conference, the party says that s not the case, adding that it s the stalwarts that don t want to agree to a conference, on the party s terms.Last year, the ANC national executive committee (NEC) resolved that the June policy conference would be extended, to include a consultative conference, after a request from the veterans.But the stalwarts have been pushing for a separate consultative conference to be held before the policy conference, saying they want the gathering to look at organisational issues and assess the state of the party.ANC stalwart Wally Serote says in their meeting with the ANC earlier this week, veterans were shocked to hear the party deny ever agreeing to hold a consultative conference. It was a shock to hear implications of that nature, there is no eye-to-eye on that matter. But ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa refutes that the party has gone back on its word, suggesting it s the stalwarts who don t want to agree to the ANC s terms of the gathering.The stalwarts are adamant the gathering must be separate from the policy conference.Meanwhile, Kodwa has confirmed that ANC branches initially rejected the proposal to hold the conference.
