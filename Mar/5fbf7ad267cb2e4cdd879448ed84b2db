Counsel for the Oakbay group of companies told the court they don&#8217;t dispute that Pravin Gordhan is not authorised to intervene in the matter with the banks. PRETORIA - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s legal team has questioned why the Gupta-owned companies have not withdrawn their opposition to his court application if they genuinely agree, as they ve claimed, with the position he s taken with respect to the banks. Gordhan has approached the High Court in Pretoria to have it rule that he s not authorised to interfere in the Guptas fight with the banks. Between December 2015 and April last year, the big four banks closed the accounts of the Gupta-owned companies, which prompted the family s request that the minister intervene. Counsel for the Oakbay group of companies told the court they don t dispute that Gordhan is not authorised to intervene in the matter with the banks. Gordhan s Advocate Jeremy Gauntlett asked why the companies simply don t withdraw their opposition, but there has been no explanation. It s like something which is out of Alice in Wonderland, to be in a situation where it s not like they re saying. It s a contested aspect, the jury is out or the judges are out. The banks are scheduled to make their submissions when the matter resumes on Wednesday morning.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
