I can confirm that the Minister of Transport has received a letter from the former board members of Prasa regarding the minister s decision to dissolve the board with immediate effect and the department is taking advice from counsel. It's understood that the minister has been given until 7pm to respond to the letter, but it's unclear whether the minister's lawyers will be prepared by that time to give any answers.This week Peters announced that after careful consideration she was dissolving the board with immediate effect and would implement interim measures soon.LISTEN: Molefe reacts to Prasa board dissolution(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
