LD pic.twitter.com/5Ejo5Y5jtAThe protesters say the city and provincial government are selling their inner city property for commercial gain and not doing enough to stop private property owners from doing the same in areas like Woodstock and Salt River.A man at the protest said: They want to put us in the bush where there are no hospitals for elderly people, no shops, there's no busses nothing.&quot;While a woman added: The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer. They don't care what happens to the poor. Reclaim the City's Emile Engel says provincial government plans to build an office park on a quarter of the Woodstock Hospital site. What we should be doing is taking jobs to people, and bringing people to jobs. But this is the opposite. Members of movement say they will continue to protest for as long as it takes for firm commitments to be made to build affordable housing.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
