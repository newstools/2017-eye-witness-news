The NICD says two cases of malaria detected in Tshwane do not represent an outbreak of malaria in South Africa. JOHANNESBURG - The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) says two cases of malaria detected in Doornpoort in Tshwane do not represent an outbreak of malaria in South Africa.The institute confirmed on Monday that two people died from the disease in the past week due to complications.It says a team from its district is conducting an investigation in the area.The institute says the two cases are isolated and South Africans should not be alarmed.The institute's professor Lucille Blumberg says, These are rare events and we re not going to see a malaria epidemic in Tshwane or related districts. Blumberg says it's likely the two people were infected by a travelling mosquito. That came from some sort of vehicle, in a suitcase or aeroplane from a known malaria area. The NICD has urged those travelling to malaria areas during the next two months to take precautions.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
