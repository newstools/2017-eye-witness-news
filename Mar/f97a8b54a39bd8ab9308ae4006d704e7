Police originally said the singer's death was unexplained but not suspicious and an initial post-mortem examination was &#8216;inconclusive&#8217;. LONDON The UK s senior coroner has confirmed that singer George Michael died of natural causes.The pop star died at the age of 53 at his Oxfordshire home on Christmas day.The coroner ruled on Tuesday that the Careless Whisper singer died from dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver.Dilated cardiomyopathy is where the heart finds it difficult to pump blood around the body because the heart has a weakened and enlarged left ventricle, while fatty liver is a build-up of fat in the vital organ.Since Michael's passing, rumours had swirled about the singer's cause of death after an initial post-mortem proved inconclusive.In a statement, Thames Valley Police said at the time: &quot;The cause of death is inconclusive and further tests will now be carried out. The results of these tests are unlikely to be known for several weeks. Thames Valley police will prepare a file for the Oxfordshire coroner. Mr Michael's death is still being treated as unexplained but not suspicious.&quot;Most recently, George's former partner Kenny Goss weighed in on the rumours, admitting he believes George passed away because his body &quot;just gave up&quot;.He said: &quot;I can't say for sure but I think his body just gave up. All these years, it was just weak.&quot;Since his death tributes have flooded in for the singer, with Adele performing a version of his track Fast Love at the Grammy Awards.Of George's death and her subsequent tribute performance, she said: &quot;I was devastated [when he died], I had to go for a walk on my own and on Boxing Day I said to Simon, my partner, I have to do that tribute.&quot;They didn't want a tribute at first - his family and camp - and they came back and were very specific that it be me. I said, 'Great, I have got something in the pipeline. If you want me to do it, I will do it'.&quot;Meanwhile, Andrew Ridgeley and Pepsi and Shirlie were on hand to pay tribute to the singer at the Brit Awards.Andrew - who performed alongside George in Wham - said: &quot;A supernova in a firmament of falling stars has been extinguished and it felt as if the sky had fallen in.&quot;We were two boys who shared a love of life-affirming music and a sense that we understood it. Careless Whisper was the song that got us signed, showed his extraordinary talent and the song which launched his solo career.&quot;Following his speech, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin took to the stage to sing A Different Corner, accompanied by an old video of George singing the same song.
