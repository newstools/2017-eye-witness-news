The union also intends to hand over a memorandum listing their grievances. CAPE TOWN The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has organised a picket outside Parliament on Sunday to express their unhappiness with the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) debacle.The union also intends to hand over a memorandum listing their grievances.Both the Sassa and the Department of Social Development have come under fire, after failing to ensure a new contract is in place, when the contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) lapses at the end of the month.The Constitutional Court also found the contract with the CPS to be invalid.Cosatu leaders Tony Ehrenreich and Motlatsi Tsubane are among the handful of attendees at the picket outside Parliament.In its statement the trade union says it is appalled with the current Sassa debacle, saying it s clear the department of social development is not taking the welfare of South Africans seriously.In the memorandum, Cosatu demands assurance from Minister Bathabile Dlamini that grants will be paid on the first of April.It s also calling for an investigation to be launched into possible corruption by CPS.It is still unclear who and if anyone from the department is here to receive the document.#SASSApicket Cosatu has reiterated its call for the removal of Minister Dlamini.IM pic.twitter.com/fbp75oB0Bp#SASSApicket Cosatu&#39;s Tony Erenreich addressing the media over the SASSA debacle.IM pic.twitter.com/3yzY44ZlU2
