The government doesn t listen to us, meaning they don t care about our people. A community member says the government disregards them. I ve been here for so long, I should be living in a nice house by now. They don t take us seriously. So let them do as they please and we will do the same. The police say they will remain in the area overnight to make sure protests don't flair up again.#PrincessProtest Protestors have set a truck alight.
