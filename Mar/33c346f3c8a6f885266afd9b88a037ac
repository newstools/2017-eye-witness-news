Collins Letsoalo says that as far as he is concerned, he's still the acting group CEO of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa. JOHANNESBURG Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) s acting CEO Collins Letsoalo says as far as he's concerned, he's still the acting group CEO and the agency's board does not have the power to terminate his contract.The board dismissed Letsoalo this week saying it never approved a R5.9 million salary and that proper procedures weren't followed.Letsoalo s alleged demand for a salary similar to his predecessor's first came to light in a Sunday Times article. He denied the allegations the following day at a media briefing. He claimed that his salary had been approved and that the newspaper article accusing him of increasing his package by 350% was part of a deliberate attempt to discredit him.Letsoalo says he only heard through media reports that his services were no longer needed at Prasa. The board can t fire me. Remember that in South Africa there are rules and regulations on how we conduct ourselves. I have never had a situation where a person is fired because of an article. Letsoalo says only the Transport Minister can terminate his contract. I am seconded in terms of the public service regulation and the only person that can revoke that secondment is the Minister of Transport. I haven t received any letter in that regard.
