President Trump&#8217;s revised executive order bars new visas for people from six predominantly Muslim countries. JOHANNESBURG - Hawaii has become the first state to sue to stop President Donald Trump's revised travel ban.Attorneys for the state filed the lawsuit earlier on Thursday in federal court in Honolulu.Trump s revised executive order bars new visas for people from six predominantly Muslim countries and temporarily shuts down the US refugee program. Hawaii's lawsuit says the order will harm Hawaii s Muslim population, tourism and foreign students.A hearing is set for 15 March, a day before the new ban is to go into effect.The government has said the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the travel rules are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks.Some legal experts have said court challenges will be more difficult now because changes to the order give exemptions to more people.The revised travel order changed and replaced the original, more sweeping ban issued on 27 January that caused chaos and protests at airports and was challenged in more than two dozen lawsuits around the country. A federal judge in Seattle put the first order on hold, in a decision upheld by an appeals court in San Francisco.The new order is much more narrowly tailored. It keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, but excludes Iraq and applies the restriction only to new visa applicants. It also removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria.The order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders, and makes waivers possible for some business, diplomatic and other travellers.Immigration advocates have said the new ban, like the original one, discriminates against Muslims.But the first hurdle in a lawsuit is proving standing to sue, which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. With so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals that a court would rule have a right to sue.Additional reporting by Reuters
