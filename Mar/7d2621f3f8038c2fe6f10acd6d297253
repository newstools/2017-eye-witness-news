JOHANNESBURG - Another person has died from typhoid and nearly 100 others have fallen ill in just one week. The Zimbabwean health ministry says at least 10 people have died and more than 1,800 have been infected with the disease since the outbreak began in October last year. In a weekly disease surveillance report, the ministry says that in just one week, one person died and 86 others contracted typhoid. Most of these suspected infections were in Harare and 30% were pre-school age children. With uncollected rubbish, frequent burst sewage pipes and erratic water supplies, the disease can spread more easily. Several cases of cholera were also reported in remote south-eastern Zimbabwe earlier this month in the wake of heavy rains and flooding.
