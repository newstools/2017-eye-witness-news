The coastal city was awarded the Games in 2015, as the only contender to make a confirmed bid. CAPE TOWN - Durban has lost the right to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games, South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) president Gideon Sam told Reuters on Monday. This is a huge disappointment for us and for the whole African continent. But without the necessary government guarantees, we couldn t move on, the Commonwealth Games Federation vice-president said by telephone. Everybody was very excited to see the Commonwealth Games staged in Durban, which was very well equipped to host the event, but once the economics started to play a role, it became difficult. We had hoped to make this a Games for all of Africa, and so this is a very sad day for the whole continent. The coastal city was awarded the Games in 2015, as the only contender to make a confirmed bid.
