There is a hive of activity outside the Union Buildings with VIP protection cars and bikes moving in and out of the premises. PRETORIA - President Jacob Zuma is set to meet with the Cabinet from 4pm.Earlier on Wednesday, the President confirmed the meeting would definitely take place.This comes as speculation grows that he is preparing to reshuffle his Cabinet. Zuma announced earlier that he had postponed the start of Wednesday s Cabinet meeting to this afternoon to enable members to attend the funeral of African National Congress (ANC) struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada.The president did not attend that funeral, saying he was complying with the wishes of the family.It s unclear if he will reshuffle the Cabinet, but ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe says he knows nothing about a possible reshuffle.The ANC s alliance partner Cosatu also indicated on Tuesday that the federation hasn t been consulted yet. There is a hive of activity outside the Union Buildings with VIP protection cars and bikes moving in and out of the premises.The president s motorcade was seen leaving the presidential guest house for the Union Buildings earlier on Wednesday.DIVISIONS IN THE ANCThe funeral service of ANC struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada has shown just how divided the governing party is.Ministers and NEC members such as Gordhan, Aron Motsoaledi, Darek Hanekom, Lindiwe Sisulu attended the funeral.But the absence of some NEC members who are proud loyal supporters of Zuma, such as ministers Lindiwe Zulu, Des Van Rooyan, Mosebenzi Zwane and Bathabile Dlamini, was noted.But perhaps the moment of the day was when former president Kgalema Motlanthe quoted a letter Kathrada wrote to the President, asking him to step down. Is it asking too much to express the hope that you will choose the correct way that is gaining momentum, to consider stepping down? WATCH: The moment Motlanthe quoted Kathrada s letter calling on Zuma to resignThe cheers lasted for over a minute, with the crowd breaking into cheers and giving Motlanthe a standing ovation.Among those on their feet were ministers Motsoaledi, Gordhan, former speaker of parliament Max Sisulu and Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi.Gwede Mantashe, who did not stand up when the letter was being read, says it s now fashionable to bash the ANC.&quot;The reality is that leadership and being the person who claps hands are two different things. When you hate, you must try to instil rational thinking under the most difficult conditions.&quot;The Presidency said the Cabinet meeting, which started at 1pm, is an an ordinary scheduled Cabinet meeting .(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
