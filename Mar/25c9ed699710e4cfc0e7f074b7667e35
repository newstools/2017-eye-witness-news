JOHANNESBURG - The Water and Sanitation Department says the gazetting process over the lifting of water restrictions will take another week to finalise. Water Minister Nomvula Mokonyane announced earlier this week that water restrictions in Gauteng should be lifted after the Vaal dam reached full capacity. Her spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says the process is proving to take longer than expected. The gazette has been prepared and it has gone through the legal process to make sure it has legal standing. It will now go through the Director General office for signature and sign-off by the minister, therefore, it ll be ready for publishing next week Friday. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
