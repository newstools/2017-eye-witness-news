We don t agree that people are unhappy because Zuma is not the ANC. Meanwhile, there have been many questions by ANC leaders about the president and whether he s to blame for the party s dwindling support.But Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, an ANC national executive committee (NEC) member, says removing Zuma won t solve the party s problems.He says the ANC s NEC has taken a decision and won t recall him from the Union Buildings.
