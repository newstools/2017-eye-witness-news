ANC Youth League Secretary Sindiso Magaqa, Jabu Mzizi and Nontsikelelo Mafa were shot at several times after a meeting. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says an investigation into the shooting of three of its Umzimkhulu councillors will give clarity on who is to blame.On Thursday, former ANC Youth League Secretary Sindiso Magaqa, Jabu Mzizi and Nontsikelelo Mafa were shot at several times after a meeting.Umzimkhulu falls under the Harry Gwala Region, which is expected to have a conference in a few weeks time where new leaders will be elected.The KZN ANC says it s not easy to tell whether Thursday's ambush is an external crime or a part of the recent spate of intra-party violence.Political analyst Lukhona Mnguni says the assassination attempts could be about both the December elective conference and municipal corruption that is currently being investigated. There is an upcoming regional conference in the Harry Gwala region and it will determine the dynamics of how that region will influence the province and the province will influence the national contest. You have to appreciate the fact that one of the frontrunners of the December conference comes from Harry Gwala. Mnguni says much of the violence in KZN has been of an intra-party nature and the ANC should resolve what Secretary General Gwede Mantashe has referred to as political bankruptcy when leaders contest for power.
