ANC's Zweli Mkhize says the party supports press freedom as it is one of the country's strengths. SOWETO - African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer-General Zweli Mkhize says the party is concerned by reports that some journalists are being intimidated for doing their jobs.This follows Black First Land First's (BLF) statement on its website warning that it would target white reporters in its protest against racism.The treasurer-general was speaking at a progressive business forum breakfast on the sidelines of the ANC's policy conference.On Thursday BLF members protested outside Business Day's Peter Bruce's house over a column he wrote about the Gupta family.But Mkhize says there are procedures to follow if people are wronged. We d be very concerned about them being targeted for some of the things they ve published, because at the end of the day, there are tribunals that can deal with the media if they are stepping over the line or take them to court. He says the ANC supports press freedom as it is one of the country's strengths.The South African National Editor's Forum released a statement in response, threatening to take legal action against the movement if it continues.
