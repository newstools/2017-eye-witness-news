JOHANNESBURG As the African National Congress' (ANC) policy conference enters its third day, there have been disagreements among some party leaders about a diagnostic report.On Friday, ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe presented his diagnostic report which revealed that many people were unhappy about scandals such as the Nkandla Constitutional court judgment, spy tapes saga and the Cabinet reshuffle, all of which involve president Jacob Zuma.According to the report, support for the ruling party has been on an accelerated decline.ANC Youth League President Collen Maine says he disagrees with Mantashe. We don t agree that people are unhappy because Zuma is not the ANC. KwaZulu-Natal ANC chairperson Sihle Zikalala is upbeat about discussions at the conference. We believe those who come with factional views will be isolated. ANC delegates have spent the last two days discussing the state of the ANC. They re expected to spend the next few days debating the party's policies.With less than four days before the conference concludes, party leaders remain hopeful they will manage to unite themselves and the party's members.WATCH: ANC NPC Day 3: Progressive Business Forum breakfast(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
