CAPE TOWN - An acrobat has plunged 30 metres to his death while performing in front of 35,000 people at a music festival in Spain. The British performer was suspended in a glass box above the stage when he came crashing down. Itâ€™s unclear what happened with his equipment to cause the fall. US band Green Day went on stage shortly after the accident, apparently unaware of the tragedy. Event organisers said they decided not to cancel the rock group's performance for security reasons.
