Issues that would be considered are reports: what is Toyota saying, we've presented the memorandum, what is the government saying, they know our issues.&quot; Last month, Santaco said failure by government to subsidise their business was killing the industry.The association said it did not understand why they are not subsidised as they are the biggest form of public transport in the country.Thousands of motorists were stranded around Gauteng early when key routes were blocked.The taxis later moved to Emperors Palace in Kempton Park, where Santaco President Phillip Taaibosch shared with them the outcome of talks with several stakeholders, including SA Taxi Finance Holdings.
