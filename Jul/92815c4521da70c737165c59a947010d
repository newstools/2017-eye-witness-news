ANC MP Makhosi Khoza is under fire from within the ANC for publicly backing a secret ballot when MPs vote in the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma next month. CAPE TOWN – African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Makhosi Khoza says that her daughter has also received death threats but this will not stop her from speaking out. Khoza is under fire from within the ANC for publicly backing a secret ballot when MPs vote in the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma next month. Speaking at a debate in Cape Town on Tuesday night, Khoza repeated her call, citing the pressure that ANC parliamentarians are under to toe the party line. Khoza says she is not the only member of her family receiving death threats. “Even today by the way, today, they didn’t send their threat to me. They sent it to my daughter, my daughter. And why should I die in silence?” Khoza’s repeated her call for National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to order a secret vote in the motion of no confidence against Zuma. She says that it is necessary to protect MPs. In addition to the threats against her and her daughter, she's cited the political killings that have taken place in her home province, KwaZulu-Natal. “We’ve had the judiciary’s office broken into and the NPA. Are all those coincidences? Are we operating in a normal environment? I want to say no, we are not.” Khoza says she’ll be voting for South Africa and the Constitution on 8 August.
