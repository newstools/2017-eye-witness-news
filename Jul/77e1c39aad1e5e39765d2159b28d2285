Family, friends and colleagues have gathered at the Mbombela Stadium to honor the artist affectionately known as Chikapa. JOHANNESBURG - Ray Phiri's children have paid an emotional tribute to the late legendary South African jazz musician, describing him as loving father who taught them respect. Phiri is being remembered at a memorial service in his home town of Nelspruit on Thursday afternoon. Family, friends and colleagues have gathered at the Mbombela Stadium to honor the acclaimed artist affectionately known to his fans as Chikapa. He lost his battle with lung cancer last week at the age of 70. Phiri's daughter Lentle said: “Our father loved saying ‘shut up and listen’, meaning we should speak when we’re supposed to and it would not hurt us if we listened. I’ve had my differences with my father, we all have, but he never stopped caring.” President Jacob Zuma has declared a special provincial official funeral for the late musician who will be laid to rest on Saturday.
