BOKSBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) s first deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila has defended Blade Nzimande s re-election as leader of the Communist Party, saying that he's still young and has the strength to lead the organisation. Nzimande was elected unopposed as general secretary at the SACP s 14th National Congress in Boksburg. Agriculture Minister Senzeni Zokwana retained his position as national chairperson and former MP Joyce Moloi-Moropa was elected treasurer-general. It s an honour to be elected by the Communist Party for this position but beyond that can we wait for a proper press briefing. #SACP Nzimande re-elected as general secretary with no objections.

He s still relatively a young comrade and he can contribute immensely. Brilliant and communist intellectual, that s also respected internationally. You don t just take away that kind of strategic space and throw it away. Thulas Nxesi also retains his position as deputy national chairperson.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
