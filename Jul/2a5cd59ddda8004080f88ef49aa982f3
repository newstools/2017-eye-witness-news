Zelda Holtzman was suspended two years ago as a probe into security breaches at the national legislature was launched. CAPE TOWN - The case dossier relating to the suspended head of Parliament’s Protection Services has disappeared from her lawyer’s offices. Zelda Holtzman was suspended two years ago as a probe into security breaches at the national legislature was launched. She’s due to appear before Parliament’s internal audit committee this month. Her counsel Johan Nortje says the entire dossier of evidence has vanished from his chambers. There is another copy of the 2000-page dossier, held by the head of Parliament’s internal audit committee. But the disappearance of Nortje’s copy will delay preparation for Holtzman’s appearance. This is not the first unexplained event to befall Holzman since her suspension in 2015. She discovered a private intelligence company had been hired to investigate her, instead of the State Security Agency, as per protocol. She laid a formal complaint against the Secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana and his deputy, Baby Tyawa, for that action, and that now forms part of an audit committee probe.
