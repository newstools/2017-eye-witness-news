The Swiss was denied a chance to celebrate the records in style as his first-round match ended abruptly midway through the second set. LONDON - There were plenty of records for Roger Federer to savour on Tuesday as he began his pursuit of a record eighth Wimbledon title, but he was denied a chance to celebrate them in style as his first-round match ended abruptly midway through the second set.Trailing 3-6, 0-3, 30-30, Alexandr Dolgopolov drew a chorus of dejected sighs on Centre Court as he walked up to the net to shake hands with Federer.It was the second successive anticlimactic ending on tennis s most famous stage after Novak Djokovic s opponent, Martin Klizan also called it quits midway through their second set.Federer s encounter against Ukrainian Dolgopolov lasted a mere 43 minutes. Fans who had poured in to see the Swiss master in action witnessed him fire down a 10,000th career ace and chalk up a record 85th win at Wimbledon, surpassing the benchmark he had shared with Jimmy Connors.By simply playing the first point, Federer also drew level with Fabrice Santoro s professional era record of playing in a 70th grand slam tournament.While it is always nice to reach such landmarks, Tuesday s result is likely to mean only one thing for the 18-times grand slam champion - he is now only six wins away from becoming the first man to hoist the Challenge Cup for the eighth time.
