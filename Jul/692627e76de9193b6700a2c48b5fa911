The Southern Cape town's last dam level reading shows it had water reserves of just over 52% last week. CAPE TOWN - The local municipality in George is warning residents who contravene water restrictions that they'll be fined. The Southern Cape town's last dam level reading shows that it had water reserves of just over 52% last week. Officials say the restrictions are indicative of the municipality's serious approach to ensuring water security. Fines for the contravention of water restrictions came into effect this month and are in line with George Municipality's Drought Management Policy. Even-numbered households may only water gardens on Mondays and Thursdays, while uneven-numbered households may do so on Tuesdays and Fridays between seven and nine at night. Municipality spokesperson Chantal Edward-Klose says transgressors will be slapped with hefty fines. “This is not a witch hunt, but a concerted effort to save water wherever we can.” Meanwhile, the City of Cape Town has urged residents to reduce consumption to 87 litres per person per day in line with level 4b restrictions.
