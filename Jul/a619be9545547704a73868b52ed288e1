The lion, known as Xanda, was shot close to where his father died, according to a group of researchers from Oxford University who were tracking him. LONDON - The son of Cecil the Lion, whose death at the hands of an American tourist in Zimbabwe caused an international uproar, has also been shot dead by a hunter in Zimbabwe, scientists said.The lion, known as Xanda, was shot on 7 July just outside the boundary of Hwange National Park, close to where his father died, according to a group of researchers from Oxford University who were tracking him.As Xanda was shot outside the park, his killing was legal. Xanda s death was almost two years to the day after Cecil s, but I hope our sadness at this eerie coincidence can be balanced if this reinforces the global attention on lion conservation, Professor David Macdonald of Oxford s WildCRU conservation team said in a statement.Cecil was shot and killed by US dentist Walter Palmer in July 2015. Two locals in Zimbabwe are being prosecuted in relation to the death. Palmer faced no charges.
