For an open hearing to be granted, all parties involved in a complaint as well as the committee members must give their permission. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) s request to have an open hearing into Bell Pottinger's conduct has been denied.The Public Relations and Communications Association made the announcement following the political party s request last week.The regulatory body is investigating Bell Pottinger after the DA lodged a complaint about some of the campaigns it ran for Oakbay, the company owned by the Gupta brothers.The DA claims that some of the campaigns stirred racial tensions in South Africa.For an open hearing to be granted, all parties involved in a complaint as well as the committee members must give their permission.Although the regulatory body, the PRCA, informed the DA that its request for such a hearing has not been successful, the party s Phumzille van Damme says it wasn t revealed who insisted that procedures be held in private. The PRCA did tell us that they never had any of the hearing open to the public. But that will not deter us from making sure that we make we represent South Africa well in this matter. She has further invited civil organisations who want to make submissions to the committee in support of the DA s case to contact the party.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
