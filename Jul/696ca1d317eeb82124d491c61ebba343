Mondli Madlala has been identified as the person who wrote the email that was posted on social media. JOHANNESBURG - The author of the fake MiWay email has apologised to the insurance company, stating he had not experienced any form of racism from the company or its staff.Mondli Madlala has been identified as the person who wrote the email that was posted on social media and purported to show that a MiWay staff member had written it.During a meeting with MiWay CEO Rene Otto, Madlala apologised for bringing the company into disrepute.He had the option of making a public apology or face legal action, and on Friday he agreed to a joint statement with MiWay regretting his actions.Otto says they recognise that they could have communicated with Madlala better. He said he was cross with us. He was upset with the repudiation of the claim and the request that he made for the recordings of the communication between us and him. But what he also told me is that we were never racist in any way during our dealings with him. MiWay says it accepts that it played a role in the frustration experienced by a former client who wrote the fake email containing racist remarks.Otto says they accept his apology. The proper apology, to start with, is an acknowledgement. I think we have to accept that we played a role in him being upset, I would ve been upset as well. It doesn t justify what he did. But it s not like he didn t have reasons to be upset. I accept, put my hand up and take accountability for that. LISTEN: MiWay CEO: Racist email is fake news on steroids(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
