JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says while the party cannot decide the fate of the Gupta family, their reported influence on the state and its impact on the party needs to be discussed.Mantashe highlighted the important challenges for the ANC while discussing his organisational report during the first day of the national policy conference on Friday.He says there s been keen interest on how the party will handle reports on the Gupta family. I thought about it. What should we do? Should we deport them? I said a political party can t do that, it s the function of the state. He says the impact of state capture on the ANC is important. If it s impacting the African National Congress, it s to be discussed at the policy conference. He says the Gupta leaks is a matter for the police and the policy conference won t request that the president explain himself.Leaked emails have shown the extent of control that the Gupta family has on the country and Cabinet ministers.Last week, Zuma said the matter would be investigated by a judicial commission of inquiry.WATCH: #ANCNPC: Gwede Mantashe breaks it down(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
