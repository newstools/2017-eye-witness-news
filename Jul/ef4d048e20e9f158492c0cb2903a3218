We made it clear that we must hear from his mouth; we re not going to accept any loss of jobs for anyone. The mayor has dismissed these claims, his office says he's delegated people who will meet with the workers representatives on Friday.Mayoral spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi said, The mayor, unfortunately, is only one person and cannot attend to all disgruntled members of society and that is why there is a city manager, who has agreed to a meeting. He is responsible for procurement in the city and has agreed to such a meeting where he will outline the city s long term plan with regards to the security contracts.
