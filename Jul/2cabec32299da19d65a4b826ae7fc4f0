As MPs prepare to vote in the motion in August, Fikile Mbalula is warning them to follow the party line or face being disciplined. SOWETO - African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee member Fikile Mbalula says party members who support a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma risk being disciplined by the party.A vote on the motion is scheduled for 8 August.Opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) have called on National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to allow parliamentarians to vote in secret.But she has yet to decide on the matter.Mbalula is warning them to follow the party line or face being disciplined. The extent to which people will be ill-disciplined, the ANC will have to apply the disciplinary procedure for those who want to use their so-called conscience to determine the voting in Parliament. When he was made aware of the Constitutional Court judgment which indicated that MPs pledge their allegiance to the electorate and not the party, Mbalula said, We have a party system in the republic and individuals whilst sworn in constitutionally in Parliament, they owe their being and mandate to the party. He says the ANC NEC has taken a final decision not to withdraw the president from the executive.#ANCNPC - Mbalula: There are no holy cowsCONTRADICTIONSDuring the media briefing, Mbalula contradicted President Zuma on two issues, saying the idea that the ANC will remain in power forever is a myth and that the country and not the ANC comes first. Zuma has said many times that the ANC will rule until Jesus Christ comes back.Mbalula has a different view. It is a myth that the ANC will rule forever. The President has also said the ANC comes first before the country.Mbalula also has a different view on this. The country comes first to all of us and that is where we need to unite. He also touched on the issue of the Guptas, saying people must not be mistaken and think the ANC defends what the Guptas family is doing. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
