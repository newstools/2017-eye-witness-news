The South African Wind Energy Association (Sawea) lodged a complaint with Nersa in October last year. CAPE TOWN – Energy regulator Nersa has yet to begin work on a probe into Eskom  over power purchasing agreements. The agreements allow renewable energy producers to sell their excess energy into the national grid. The South African Wind Energy Association (Sawea) lodged a complaint with Nersa in October last year. It claimed Eskom is in contravention of its licensing conditions because it had not signed 37 power purchase agreements with independent producers. Sawea's Brenda Martin says Nersa contacted them last week. “We received a letter last Thursday, giving us five days to respond and say whether our original complaint was still valid, whether any issues had been resolved and whether the investigation should commence.” Nersa's Charles Hlebela has confirmed the probe is yet to start. “The process has not yet been finalised, but we’re liaising with Sawea and Eskom.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
