The injuries from the assault left 14-year-old Siphamandla Choma paralysed and he died in hospital in March. JOHANNESBURG - The Mpumalanga Education Department  has fired the Manyano Primary School principal who allegedly assaulted a 14-year-old last year, leaving him paralysed. The department started its disciplinary process two months ago and says the dismissal is appropriate because he violated his responsibility of protecting learners. The injuries from the assault left 14-year-old Siphamandla Choma paralysed and he died in hospital in March. The principal allegedly assaulted Choma last year for apparently stealing R150. While the principal has not confessed to the assault and his name is being withheld, the Mpumalanga Education Department's Jasper Zwane says they are convinced that he contravened the South African Schools Act. “His behaviour has brought the department into disrepute and for that reason, chairperson of the disciplinary hearing found him guilty and sanctioned his dismissal” The National Prosecuting Authority's Monica Nyuswa says the principal has been charged with assault. “The accused is going to make his first appearance on 6 September in Middleburg Magistrates Court on a charge of assault GBH.” Zwane says the accused has a right to appeal the department's decision with the MEC.
