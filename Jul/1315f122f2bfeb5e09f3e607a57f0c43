CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has handed over waterless cleaning products to taxi operators and carwash owners as part of efforts to reduce water usage. Level 4b water restrictions have been implemented. Mayor Patricia de Lille says it's important that all Capetonians do their bit to save water. “I can assure you the car looks better than when it was washed with water, because it shines and you don’t have a tap running while washing your car.”  The city has called on all consumers to adhere to level 4b water restrictions, restrict their total usage per person per day to less than 87 litres, and warned that excessive users that non-compliance will result in the installation of water management devices on their premises.  Dam levels remain critically low while water usage continues to be too high. The city says water reserves must be built up while there is still water. De Lille says there’s room to save more water. “So many of our residents are super-savers and of course they must please continue to think of creative ways to save more water. Many households have repaired leaks on their properties following our direct engagements with them, but for those who continue to ignore our warnings and the law, we will be limiting their supply.” The city has initiated emergency plans and implemented dredging at dams.
