CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape legislature's Scopa is trying to establish whether former Transport and Public Works MEC Marius Fransman should be held responsible for billions in wasteful expenditure.Scopa has relaunched an investigation into the payment of R9 billion to consultants by the provincial transport and Public Works Department flagged by the Auditor-General.Health Department officials who briefed the committee cleared former Health MEC Pierre Uys of any responsibility. The former transport and public works HOD has since left the position, so he has not been able to give comment about Fransman's role.Scopa chair Ferlon Christians says this means Fransman will have to appear to answer. It s very difficult to say what the outcome will be with a process like this. You don t want to put the cart before the horse. You want to give everyone a fair opportunity. Fransman has been unavailable for comment.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
