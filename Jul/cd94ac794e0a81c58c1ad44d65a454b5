Police lobbed stun grenades and teargas to disperse the angry crowd. CAPE TOWN - A violent protest at the Imizamo Yethu informal settlement brought Hout Bay outside Cape Town to a complete standstill on Saturday morning.Police lobbed stun grenades and teargas to disperse the angry crowd. A group of residents say they're angry at the delays in the City of Cape Town's service delivery, including its re-blocking plan.City officials have been busy with the massive re-blocking plan following a devastating fire in the township three months ago. New zones of land are being allocated for the thousands of displaced residents who lost their homes in the blaze. Residents have been living in temporary structures on different sites around Hout Bay while the re-blocking phases are being completed. The City of Cape Town's law enforcement and South African Police Service officials have closed off roads leading towards the Hout Bay sports field in Victoria Road.Dozens of informal structures, made of corrugated iron and wood, have been erected on the field to house a few hundred of the affected Imizamo Yethu residents. This is just one of the temporary sites the municipality has provided.But resident Yanga Ndesi says they re tired of living in cold and damp structures, where there is no electricity while receiving no word on the progress of the re-blocking process.Protesters are burning tyres and other material along the road. Several structures which have been torn down have been tossed along the roadway.#HoutBayProtest Further down the main road. @MoniqueMortlock pic.twitter.com/49hxIvk4bh#HoutBayProtest Protesters have broken down temporary structures from City of Cape Town. @MoniqueMortlock pic.twitter.com/wVEA1zgAw9(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
