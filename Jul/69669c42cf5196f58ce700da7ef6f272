Prasa Board says the rail agency did not get any use out of Spanish-built locomotives purchased through an irregular tender. CAPE TOWN - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) Board says the rail agency did not get any use out of Spanish-built locomotives purchased through an irregular tender.The High Court in Johannesburg has found in favour of the board and set aside the R2.6 billion contract that was signed in 2013.The court found the tender was rigged to favour Swifambo Rail Leasing, a company that used its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment rating to be the front for a Spanish manufacturer.The implication of the court s ruling is that Swifambo has to pay back the money it received from Prasa.However, the company has indicated in a statement that it intends challenging the decision.Prasa board director William Steenkamp says this will delay efforts to recoup the money. And we re not na ve we are anticipating that there could be an appeal against the judgment because you re talking about a massive amount of money - R2.6 billion is not exactly small change. Prasa needs new locomotives to replace old stock, but the Spanish built locomotives do not fit the agency s height specifications.Steenkamp says this is one of the reasons why they were never put to service.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
