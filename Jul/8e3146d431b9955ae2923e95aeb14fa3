Enoch Godongwana says the arguments about the Mining Charter are not about the ultimate aims. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress' (ANC) economic transformation chair Enoch Godongwana says there's been no argument about the aims of the Mining Charter but only about how it's designed.The party's policy conference has also resolved not to change the Reserve Bank's constitutionally mandated independence in setting monetary policy.Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane's Mining Charter has been strongly criticised by the Chamber of Mines after imposed new regulations on black ownership and said mines had to pay a percentage of their turnover to government.Godongwana says the arguments about the Mining Charter are not about the ultimate aims. We ve never had disagreements about the targets, beneficiaries, but what is being contested is the design. He also says there s broad agreement that the economy needs to change. A key element is also the issue of concentration in the economy, that we should speed up radical economic transformation and change the concentration. Godongwana s confirmed delegates want to retain the Reserve Bank s independence but do want its ownership structure to change.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
