The city wants to retain all brick buildings, the coal store and brick smoke stacks, provided they are still structurally sound. CAPE TOWN - Seven years after the demolition of the Athlone Power Station cooling towers, the City of Cape Town is now ready to take the next step to decommission the site.It plans to award a three-year, R13 million tender to de-clutter the site in preparation for re-development.The city is now requesting public input into the contract that will be awarded to the same company that it previously tried to avoid awarding the tender to.The awarding of the tender stalled in 2012 because of a protracted legal battle with the engineering company, Aurecon, that was only finalised in February this year, where the Constitutional Court ruled the company, which also carried out the pre-feasibility study, should decommission the Athlone Power Station.Aurecon will now be responsible for the removal of all redundant material and electrical infrastructure, as well as the rehabilitation of contaminated areas, in preparation for future development.The city wants to retain all brick buildings, the coal store and brick smoke stacks, provided they are still structurally sound.No redevelopment plans have been finalised, but the city has been working with the World Bank to design a mixed-use development which would include residential, commercial, retail and public facilities.
