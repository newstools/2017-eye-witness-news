Parliament says if no one is available from its legal unit, someone will be recruited from outside the legislature. CAPE TOWN - Parliament has moved to assure lawmakers that portfolio committees investigating state capture will be adequately resourced. It's a response to the Democratic Alliance's (DA) claim that the Public Enterprises Committee's inquiry into Eskom  would be hampered if members of Parliament (MPs) don't have access to seasoned lawyers and other experts. Parliament says that if no one is available from its legal unit, someone will be recruited from outside the legislature. Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says: “And if we do not get or the rest of the legal advisors are busy elsewhere with the other work of Parliament, an alternative arrangement will be made.”
