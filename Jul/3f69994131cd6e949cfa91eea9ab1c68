The MEC says in the past few months the violence between rival associations Nanduwe and Wata has put commuters at risk. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane says the safety of commuters is the reason why the department decided to temporarily close certain routes in Soweto. The MEC says in the past few months the violence between rival associations Nanduwe and Wata has put commuters at risk. The two associations have been battling each other over taxi routes despite a court ruling in favour of Nanduwe. Nkosi-Malobane says officers will make sure no one uses the closed roads. “We are confident that our teams will be on the ground on Thursday to make sure no vehicle from Nanduwe or Wata operates in the five areas.” Meanwhile, Transport MEC Ishmael Vadi says the department cannot allow commuters to be attacked in taxi wars. “We’ve had instances where innocent people were attacked or chased out of taxis. Some of them have been shot.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
