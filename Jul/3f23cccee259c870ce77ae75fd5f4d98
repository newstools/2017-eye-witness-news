The Valhalla Park Community Policing Forum says City of Cape Town officials should not have allowed criminals to stop development in the area. CAPE TOWN - The Valhalla Park Community Policing Forum (CPF) says City of Cape Town officials should not have allowed criminals to stop development in the area. On Thursday, Mayor Patricia de Lille told council a formal housing project in the area had to be halted due to threats from “gangsters”. “The gangsters made up their mind that unless we pay them protection money, they will not allow the project to go on.” The development would've provided more than 700 families with subsidised homes. CPF chairperson Graham Lindhorst says community members are upset about the decision to halt the project. Lindhorst adds the city should have intervened sooner by using the resources at their disposal, like law enforcement agencies. “My feeling is that the government should never have just allowed those people to go on as they did, and then even withdraw the entire project. They should have intervened with all their might because they do have the resources to do so.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
