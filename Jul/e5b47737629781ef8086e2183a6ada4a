Prasa's board has succeeded in getting an irregular locomotive tender set aside nearly two years after the Public Protector found large-scale maladministration at the rail agency. CAPE TOWN - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa's (Prasa) board has succeeded in getting an irregular locomotive tender set aside nearly two years after the Public Protector found large-scale maladministration at the rail agency.The board, led by chairperson Popo Molefe, says it has been vindicated by the South Gauteng High Court's decision to nullify a R3.5 billion contract with Swifambo Rail Leasing.The deal was struck in 2013 under former Prasa CEO Lucky Montana.Non-executive Prasa board director William Steenkamp says the tender was irregular. Swifambo was a start-up company and did not have any capacity to manufacture and supply Prasa with locomotives. It was 100% dependent on a company called Vossloh. He says Swifambo Rail Leasing had been fronting for a Spanish manufacturer.The company had supplied trains that were unsuitable for the local rail network.In late 2015, former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela released a report titled Derailed, in which she said the board had a responsibility to act against allegations of wrongdoing.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
