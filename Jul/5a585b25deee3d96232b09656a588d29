The ANC in Gauteng and Limpopo have made it clear they believe there is nothing called white monopoly capital. SOWETO - African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee member Fikile Mbalula has criticised those who deny that the term white monopoly capital has been part of the party's vocabulary for years.Mbalula briefed the media on the party's organisational renewal discussion document earlier on Sunday.He says state capture and the Gupta family will be discussed extensively.The ANC in Gauteng and Limpopo have made it clear they believe there is nothing called white monopoly capital.But Mbalula says this is not true. White monopoly capital, in particular, has been in ANC lexicon since its founding in 1912. The blurring of line and political amnesia is mostly nefarious and ideologically dishonest. He also responded to a question about state capture and whether delegates will be allowed to debate the influence of the Gupta family on the state. There is nothing that is under the carpet, we are laying it bare because that is the nature of our movement. Mbalula says the Guptas are not the monopoly in South Africa.He also criticised other party leaders who've questioned whether radical economic transformation is a policy of the ruling party.Some senior party members claim the term is being used by a faction, who want transformation to benefit a few individuals and business people.Mbalula says those people are disingenuous. There is a general confusion as a result of a departure from the vocabulary or lexicon of the movement. Even senior or perceived to be members of the ANC and the alliance get caught up in a situation where we use newer liberal phrases is common and denial of ANC policy positions thus the lexicon erupts. The ANC has a policy of radical economic transformation. WATCH: Mbalula: When people march to Guptas, Peter Bruce homes, we must hit them hard
