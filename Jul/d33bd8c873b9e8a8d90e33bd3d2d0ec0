ANC Economic Transformation Commission Chair Enoch Godongwana announced earlier on Wednesday that it's an anomaly for the country's bank to be in private hands. JOHANNESBURG - The Reserve Bank says it has noted that the African National Congress (ANC) policy conference has resolved to keep its ownership independent for now but will investigate changing this in the future.ANC Economic Transformation Commission Chair Enoch Godongwana announced earlier on Wednesday that it's an anomaly for the country's bank to be in private hands.The bank has responded to the discussion by the ANC to change the bank's ownership by saying the shareholding of the bank has no bearing on its policy or regulatory role.However, the bank has also emphasised if the ownership is changed there will still not be a higher degree of control as the bank will continue to have an oversight role.But following the announcement the rand lost significant ground to the major currencies.It has already been under pressure this week with economists saying that international factors and poor manufacturing figures are to blame.This latest announcement has added pressure on the local currency.At 4pm the local currency was trading at R13.48 to the US dollar compared to R13.08 on Tuesday, at R17.41 to the pound from R17.10 before and at R15.27 to the euro from R14.95 the day before.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
