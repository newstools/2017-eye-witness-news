Sihle Zikalala says he&#8217;s ready for the criticism that this could only prolong the factional disputes and bring factional politics into government. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) s leader in KwaZulu-Natal Sihle Zikalala says he s proposing that the person who loses the party s leadership battle should automatically become its deputy leader because it will break the politics of slates.Zikalala says this would mean that if deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa were to lose to Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma he would automatically become the deputy leader of the party and they would have to work together.He says that this is a simple solution that will really break apart the factions in the party. Something that works, we can t take that as a Constitutional issue but we can develop it as an approach to the forthcoming conference, given the current challenges that are facing the country. And he s ready for the criticism that this could only prolong the factional disputes and bring factional politics into government. It would help us to dissolve factions. Even the leadership that will be elected, they need to be cadres who are upfront and deal with factionalism. Zikalala is seen as one of the key powerbrokers but won t say if he believes he s speaking from a position of strength for Dlamini-Zuma or out of weakness.WATCH: Cyril Ramaphosa: This is the ANC at it's best
