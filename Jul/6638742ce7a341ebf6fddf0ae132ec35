The High Court in Johannesburg set aside the multi-billion-rand contract on grounds that it was irregularly awarded. JOHANNESBURG - With the High Court finding clear criminal conduct in the awarding of a Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) locomotive tender, it remains to be seen if anyone will face prosecution.The High Court in Johannesburg set aside the multi-billion-rand contract on grounds that it was irregularly awarded.When asked whether a case would be opened against those implicated in the Prasa locomotive tender, the Hawks' Hangwani Mulaudzi simply said that investigations are ongoing.Mulaudzi ignored a follow-up question on whether that meant that a docket had in fact been opened in respect of this case.The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) s Luvuyo Mfaku says it can only make a decision on whether to prosecute if it is presented with a docket containing evidence.The High Court found that the locomotive tender was tailored to suit the successful bidder and the contract was concluded as the result of a corrupt tender process.The court further found that the company fronting the tender contravened provisions of the BEE Act.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
