CAPE TOWN - A six-year old girl who lost her only hearing aids in the devastating fire in Imizamo Yethu earlier this year no longer has to live in silence.Nomfundo Mbali had told Eyewitness News how her daughter Lime's hearing aids, which were usually kept on a bedside table, were lost when their home burnt down in March.When audiologist Julie Smith heard the story, she knew they had to help Lime. Because we are audiologists we just have such a soft spot for children and making sure that if they have a hearing loss, they have hearing aids. And because they had lost the hearing aids in the fire my colleague just decided let's be proactive and let s do something about it and see how we can help her. Smith says they fitted Lime, who has profound hearing loss in both ears, with her new hearing aids on Tuesday. And when I put the hearing aids in, the first thing that she started to do was to make sound, because she s living in a world of silence without a hearing aid. And as soon as the hearing aids went in she started to make her sounds and she was smiling and she was so happy. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
