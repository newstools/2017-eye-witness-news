JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says the party is continually under construction and that s why it takes the behaviour and ethics of its members seriously.The ANC is holding its national policy conference in Nasrec, Johannesburg, where various issues, including white monopoly capital, radical economic transformation and land reform will be unpacked.Kodwa says that the ANC will use the conference to remind party members of the mandate and vision to serve South African people. We must name and shame those individuals who undermine the people s confidence. The ANC is incorruptible as an organisation because the ANC is the people of South Africa. He says that while there are traces of corruption in the party, it is not systemic or reflective of the entire organisation. We are here because there s a system in the African National Congress because in six months from now, we re going to our conference where we ll talk about leadership.
