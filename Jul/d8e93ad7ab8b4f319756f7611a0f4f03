By 2020, it will cost Germany $107 million a year to look after the migrants it’s taken in. PRETORIA - The G20 summit in Germany is likely to grapple with solutions to the migrant crisis, with some suggesting investment in Africa would curb the growing number of people leaving the continent to find a better life in Europe. This argument will likely find currency with those industrialised countries that have the means to take the bet. Follow the money and it's obvious why there’s a rush of migrants from Africa to Europe. The average annual income in Europe is $33,248. The equivalent figure for sub-Saharan Africa is $1,504. Another look at the figures shows why Europe cannot sustain the influx. By 2020, it will cost Germany $107 million a year to look after the migrants it’s taken in. Last year, it accommodated more than 750,000 refugees. Germany has a compelling case for urging G20 colleagues to spread the load.
