PARLIAMENT - Parliament s inquiry into political party funding is calling for submissions before it starts work next month.The ad hoc committee on the funding of political parties says interested individuals and organisations should submit their views in writing by 21 July.The committee is set to investigate both state and private funding of parties represented in Parliament and provincial legislatures and will be holding public hearings.Ad hoc committee chairperson Vincent Smith says it s vital that people make their views known. We re hoping to eventually emerge with legislation that would enhance transparency of who in fact funds political parties, enhance accountability as to where those funds come from and what they have been used for and also to begin a process of questionable funders. Smith says investment entities of political parties will also come under scrutiny to ensure they aren t conduits for state funds to be syphoned into party coffers.The committee will start its work early next month with public hearings planned for 15 and 16 August.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
