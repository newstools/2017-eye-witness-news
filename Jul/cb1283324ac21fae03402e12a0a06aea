The ad-hoc committee set up to conduct the inquiry is calling for written submissions from interested individuals and organisations. CAPE TOWN - Smaller opposition parties are expected to argue for a fairer split of state funds when Parliament s inquiry into the funding of political parties gets underway in August.The ad-hoc committee set up to conduct the inquiry is calling for written submissions from interested individuals and organisations, which must be in before the deadline on 21 July.The way in which state funds for political parties are allocated has long been a sore point for smaller parties.Freedom Front Plus chief whip Corne Mulder said, The ANC and the National Party in 1997, passed a bill in Parliament with their majority, which made the provision that only 10% of the funds are allocated on an equitable basis and 90% are allocated proportionally. Now we think that cannot be constitutional and that s been the case for many, many years. Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said, I know that it's a concern for the smaller parties, so that s an area we will also look at and find a mechanism to ensure that those concerns are addressed. The committee s first meeting is set down for 3 August.
