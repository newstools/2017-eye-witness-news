The Academy Award-winning actress has admitted to sexually experimenting earlier in her life - but Theron insisted she 'really likes dudes'. LOS ANGELES - Award-winning actress Charlize Theron has admitted she had sexual relations with women during her younger years. The Academy Award-winning actress has admitted to sexually experimenting earlier in her life - but Theron insisted she "really likes dudes". During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Theron - who stars in an X-rated lesbian love scene in new movie Atomic Blonde - was asked if she ever "took a dip in the lady pond", and she replied: "Ooh. When I was younger, yes. "When you're young, you're exploring it all. But, it was pretty clear that I really like dudes." The 41-year-old beauty also thinks bisexual love is under-represented in movies. Asked whether it was important for her Atomic Blonde character to be bisexual, Theron said: "Why not? It should be normalised by now. It's something not represented enough in cinema." Earlier this month, meanwhile, Theron admitted to having gone on a date with a "really cool dude". The Hollywood actress - who ended her engagement to Sean Penn in June 2016 - confirmed she is back in the dating game, but refused to reveal the identity of her new man. Theron shared: "I went on a date maybe, like, a month ago. I had a great date, I've got to tell you. I had an incredible date. This guy really impressed me. "We went for a nine-mile hike in the middle of the night. It was a full moon. But I was really impressed. It was fun." Theron remained coy about her unnamed man, but admitted she enjoyed spending time with him, describing their date as "fun". She explained: "I'm not going to say where we met, but we ended up going for a walk ... It was just really fun. He was super-funny. "I think he's just a really cool dude. It was super private ... that's what made it so much fun, too."
