LONDON - Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta said he would rather have Neymar at the club than a massive transfer fee, with speculations linking the Brazilian to Paris Saint-Germain in a world record deal.PSG have reportedly held discussions with Barcelona about a transfer for the 25-year-old that would smash the world record 89 million Manchester United paid for France midfielder Paul Pogba last year.&quot;I do not think 200-300 million will be more beneficial for Barcelona than having Neymar,&quot; Iniesta told a news conference ahead of the Saturday's pre-season friendly against Real Madrid.&quot;He is one of the best players in the world and I always want the best players in my team. I have no doubt that we all wish him to continue with us.&quot;We would like you (the press) to not keep asking (about Neymar) so much, but to end this, there is only one way: Neymar will speak.&quot;Neymar, whose buy-out clause at Barcelona was set at over 200 million, cancelled a personal appearance in China next week because he was said to be &quot;busy with transfer business&quot;.Iniesta also confirmed the training bust-up between Neymar and team mate Nelson Semedo on Friday but played it down, saying it only held more significance due to the recent transfer speculations.&quot;It's true that there was that incident, which can be part of a training session,&quot; Iniesta added.&quot;But because of the situation and what is being said about Ney, which is worldwide, it has much more significance. For those of us who are training, however, it's nothing.&quot;
