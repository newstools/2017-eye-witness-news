JOHANNESBURG - The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) says it’s investigating a spate of major car accidents this weekend that left at least 20 people dead. The fatal accidents took place in Gauteng, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal. Earlier on Sunday, a man who was allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol ploughed into a group of men in Randburg, killing four people. The RTMC’s Simon Zwane says a vehicle collision in Durban claimed six lives on Saturday night. “And another accident on Friday, an SA Police Service vehicle was involved in a collision with another vehicle in Mpumalanga claiming the lives of six people.” Meanwhile, KZN Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda has called for measures to be put in place to curb road deaths in the province. The implementation of the newly-approved national road safety strategy is expected to decrease the number of fatalities on the road. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
