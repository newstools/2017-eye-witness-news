Five-month-old Ava Barley asphyxiated after she rolled off a bed at a Pinelands early childhood development centre in 2010. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Social Development will study a court ruling that found it jointly liable for damages following the death of an infant. Five-month-old Ava Barley  asphyxiated after she rolled off a bed at a Pinelands early childhood development centre in 2010. On Friday, Judge Daniel Dlodlo ruled that despite the department’s bold denials, it is liable to pay damages to baby Ava Barley's parents following the tragedy. Dlodlo found that the daycare owner had applied to the department to be registered in 2008. At the time of the baby’s death, the centre was still not registered. Baby Ava became trapped between a bed and a bedside table when she rolled off the bed. The baby’s parents also won a negligence case against the owner of the daycare centre.
