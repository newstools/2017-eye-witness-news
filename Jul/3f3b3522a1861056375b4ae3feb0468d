Baleka Mbete reportedly told journalists at the ANC policy conference that MPs owed it to the party that sent them to Parliament to take a position guided by it in the no-confidence vote. CAPE TOWN - National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete s insistence that African National Congress (ANC) Members of Parliament (MPs) toe the party line in next month s motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma has come under fire from the Democratic Alliance (DA).The opposition party s chief whip John Steenhuisen says Mbete is unable to manage the conflict between her position as ANC national chairperson and that of Speaker.Mbete was reported to have told journalists at the ANC s policy conference in Gauteng that MPs owed it to the party that sent them to Parliament to take a position guided by it.The National Assembly Speaker is the latest top ANC official to send a strong message to the party s MPs about how they should deal with the no-confidence debate against President Zuma on 8 August.Mbete says ANC MPs will vote on the basis that the party cannot remove itself as the government.Steenhuisen says Mbete s comments show she is putting her party before Parliament. I think they are deeply inappropriate given the role that the Speaker plays in the House and particularly given the direction by the Constitutional Court ruling where MPs are exhorted to put their country s interests and the interests of the Constitution ahead of their party. Steenhuisen s also taken issue with Mbete s request that parties submit to her by 14 July their arguments for and against a secret ballot, saying the decision is hers to take alone.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
