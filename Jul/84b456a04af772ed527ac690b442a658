The IFP says it will prove that Suna Venter's death was not in vain. JOHANNESBURG - The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) says journalists at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) should fight against what it calls shenanigans within the public broadcaster . The party say this will prove that Suna Venter's death was not in vain.The 32-year-old was found dead in her Johannesburg apartment this week. Her family says she'd been battling a heart condition brought on by trauma and unnatural stress.Venter made headlines last year when she was suspended from the public broadcaster, along with several of her colleagues who would later be known as the SABC 8.The group voiced their concerns about interference in the SABC's newsrooms.The IFP s Narend Singh has paid tribute to the late producer. We trust her family will be able to deal with this loss and recognise that Suna Venter, as a journalist and a family member, was a hero of all times. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
