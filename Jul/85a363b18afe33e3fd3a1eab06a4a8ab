CAPE TOWN – Phumlani Village community leaders have agreed to cease protests following a meeting with the ward councillor. On Thursday, residents from the informal settlement situated between Lotus River and Pelican Park protested against the lack of housing and poor service delivery. A fuel station was set alight and robbed, tuck shops were looted and roads were blocked during the protest. But community leaders have condemned the violence, blaming it on opportunistic criminals. Frustrated residents blamed the poor living conditions on the area’s ward councillor Shanen Rossouw, saying she has not engaged with them over the past few years. Rossouw met with leaders on Friday morning to discuss the way forward. “They gave us a list of concerns, mostly water and sanitation concerns and we agreed on how I’m going to have a walkabout in next week or so and then we’re going to take it from there.” Police are still monitoring the area.
