JOHANNESBURG - With condemnation mounting of Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, her office says any mistakes made over her findings that the South African Reserve Bank's mandate must be changed were honest mistakes to do with the legal crafting of her order.On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank confirmed it'll continue with its application to overturn her findings the Democratic Alliance has said it's considering trying to remove her from office and the Economic Freedom Fighters has said she should resign.At the same time, the person who lodged the original complaint in the Bankorp bailout that led to her finding, Advocate Paul Hoffman, has also said she is not competent to stay in office after she said she would not oppose the Reserve Bank's application on its mandate.Hoffman says he believes Mkhwebane should pay for the legal costs of all of this out of her own pocket. The report is either the product of incompetence or something more sinister. But her spokesperson Cleo Mosana had to defend her conduct on the Radio 702 s Eusebius Mckaiser Show. If you make a mistake, you do a typo yourself and say oh this is a typo .
