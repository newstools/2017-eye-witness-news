JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) member of Parliament Mondli Gungubele says he has not changed his mind and will still vote for President Jacob Zuma to step down when the motion of no confidence is heard in Parliament in less than two weeks time.Gungubele is part of a growing number of ANC MPs who have publicly called for Zuma to go. Others include Pravin Gordhan and Makhosi Khoza, who was recently charged with ill-discipline by the party.Gungubele says he cannot hide the fact that he does not have any confidence in President Zuma.He says all the information emerging around Zuma is simply too much to ignore. The President having accepted that Guptas are his friends and ANC being in this situation because of the Guptas and with a myriad of evidence, I find it difficult to have confidence in the president. The former Ekurhuleni mayor seem undeterred by the ANC warning its members to toe the party line and vote against the motion when it is debated on 8 August.Speaker Baleka Mbete is yet to announce whether the vote will be via secret ballot.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
