Mmamoloko Kubayi says the resource and energy plans will pave the way for a decision on sourcing energy from independent power producers. CAPE TOWN - Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi says her department will have integrated resource and energy plans ready by the end of this financial year.She says these will pave the way for a decision on sourcing energy from independent power producers.Kubayi says she wants Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille to withdraw her High Court application she filed this week. De Lille is asking the court to allow the city to buy from independent producers without the minister s permission.The mayor says Cape Town consumers deserve to have a wider range of cheaper energy options. But the minister says de Lille is wasting taxpayers' money by taking the department to court.She says a more holistic approach is needed to determine what the country s power needs are.In May, Kubayi put on hold pending agreements with independent power producers.She says de Lille is being too hasty. She can't just rush to court before we can even talk. She hasn t even asked for anything. Kubayi says her department has already considered the public comments on two key plans that will outline the country s energy needs.
