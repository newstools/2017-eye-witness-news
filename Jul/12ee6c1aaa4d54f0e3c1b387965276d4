JOHANNESBURG The South African Communist Party s (SACP) 14th Congress has resolved that the party must contest future elections, and has not ruled out contesting in 2019.The party started its national congress in Boksburg on Monday.#SACP has resolved to contest elections in 2019 Declaration says the exact modality in which we do this must be determined" CMThe party's Chris Mahlako read the communist party's declaration. We have resolved that while the SACP will certainly contest elections; the exact modalities in which we do so need to be determined by way of a concrete analysis of concrete reality and through the process of active engagement with the worker and progressive formations. In a statement released on Saturday afternoon, the party says it will maintain the alliance.#SACP Nzimande says They will talk to their alliance partners about their declaration. They resolved to maintain Alliance.It does, however, add that while the alliance remains strategic, the way in which it currently functions is outdated and incapable of holding the alliance any further.The SACP further states that it is important for alliance partners to express their views openly, without fear, favour or prejudice.The party notes, seemingly with concern, that the last time the alliance held a national summit was two years ago, in June/July 2015. The alliance should have held an economic policy summit by June this year, before the ANC national policy conference and our 14th Party Congress.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
