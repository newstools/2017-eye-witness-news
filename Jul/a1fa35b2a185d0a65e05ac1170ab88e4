People are hungry for money, they can do anything just to get money. Reverend Sonto Thusi from the Umzinyathi Christian Council says people go into politics for money and power. And if someone is seen as a stumbling block for somebody to have money, that means that particular person who is seen as a stumbling block has to be removed.

Both church leaders agree that society has lost a great sense of morality.#MoeraneCommission Thusi : People are also hungry for money so if you are seen as a stumbling block , you are removed.ZN#MoeraneCommission Thusi clarifies that when he says "removed" he literally means the murder of someone who is seen as a stumbling block#MoeraneCommission Thusi: There's also a lack of trust.If you are seen to be on good terms with people seen as the enemy, you are removed.ZN#MoeraneCommission Rev.Thusi says "The moment we decided to put our minds first and God behind, that when we lost it (morality) ".
