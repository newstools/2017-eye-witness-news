Eyewitness News revealed this morning that intruders gained access to two offices at the building located at Church Square in Pretoria. PRETORIA – The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has confirmed the office of Gauteng’s Director of Public Prosecutions was burgled overnight but has not provided any further details. Eyewitness News revealed on Monday morning that intruders gained access to two offices at the building located at Church Square in Pretoria. This breach of security comes less than a week after computers were stolen from the Hawks’ head offices in Silverton. The NPA’s Bulelwa Makeke says they have been alerted to the break-in but are unable to provide any further details while the scene is being processed by investigators. Eyewitness News understands that intruders gained entry to two offices on the second floor by climbing through windows located above the doors. It is not known what was stolen or whose offices were targeted or how the culprits gained access to the building which has only two security guarded entrances. Meanwhile, the Hawks suspect that the break-in at their Silverton head offices last week was an inside job but no arrests have been made.
