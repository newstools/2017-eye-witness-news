The UN Population Fund's Esther Muia says South Africa is one of a few countries where the family planning commodities budget is funded 100% by the government. CAPE TOWN - The United Nations (UN) says the South African government should improve family planning services to accommodate young people. This year's theme for World Population Day is Family Planning: Empowering People, Developing Nations. The day was established by the UN on this day 30 years ago and seeks to focus attention on the urgency of population issues. The UN Population Fund's Esther Muia says South Africa is one of a few countries where the family planning commodities budget is funded 100% by the government. “This really helps to ensure that the availability of family planning commodities is not a constraint to access to family planning.” Muia says, however, there are major challenges facing young people or adolescents who are sexually active and in need of family planning services in the country. “This is because of the opening hours and the fact that some of the service providers are yet to be really skilled to deal with young people’s needs and sexual and reproductive health.” (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
