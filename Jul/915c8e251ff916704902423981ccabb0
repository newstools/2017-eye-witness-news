The City of Cape Town issued yet another warning after having further intensified water restrictions this month. CAPE TOWN - Repeat water guzzlers will have devices installed at their homes and businesses to restrict their use of the resource.The City of Cape Town issued yet another warning after having further intensified water restrictions to Level 4b this month.Dam levels remain critically low.The city's Zara Nicholson said: Engagements will continue with excessive users and letters will be sent to them and if they can t explain their excessive water use then water will be restricted. There is room to save more water. Under Level 4b restrictions, water users are required to cut back on their individual usage to less than 87 litres of water per person per day.The city has encouraged residents to follow the list below to get to 87 litres of water per person per day in total.Residents are asked to: Only flush the toilet when necessary, wherever you are. Take a shower that is shorter than two minutes. Collect your shower, bath and basin water and reuse it to flush your toilet, and for the garden and cleaning (bear in mind that greywater use has some health and hygiene risks you must avoid; keep hands and surface areas sanitised/disinfected). Defrost food in the fridge or naturally rather than placing it under running water. Use a cup instead of running taps in the bathroom or kitchen for brushing teeth, shaving, drinking etc. Wait for a full load before running washing machines and dishwashers. The rinse water from some washing machines can be reused for the next wash cycle. Upgrade to a multi-flush toilet and/or put a water displacement item in the cistern which can halve your water use per flush. Fit taps with aerators or restrictors to reduce flow to no more than six litres per minute, as per the City s by-laws. Check for leaks on your property and fix any leaks immediately.Additional reporting by Kevin Brandt.
