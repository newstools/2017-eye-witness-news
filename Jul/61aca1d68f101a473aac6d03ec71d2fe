CAPE TOWN - A flight from Seattle to Beijing was forced to turn around after a passenger attempted to open one of the plane’s exit doors at high altitude. The 23-year-old passenger from Florida was arrested after the plane landed at Seattle’s Tacoma International Airport. But not before a flight attendant broke a bottle of wine over his head and handcuffed him with cable ties to restrain him. The incident took place in the first-class cabin where the passenger had been seated, about an hour into the flight on delta air lines. The man is facing 20 years in prison for interfering with a flight crew.
