JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has argued that it is in the interests of the rule of law, due process and the Constitution that President Jacob Zuma is prosecuted on charges of corruption.This is among the submissions the party has made in Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) s application to appeal the High Court ruling which set aside the decision to withdraw the case against the president.Former prosecutions boss Mokotedi Mpshe withdraw the case in 2009 after considering representations from Zuma, which included the so-called spy tapes.In April 2016, a full bench of the High Court in Pretoria set aside the decision on the basis that it was irrational.While the prosecuting authority raises six grounds of appeal, the DA says that it failed to deal with the High Court s findings of irrationality.A full bench found that Mpshe did not enquire further about the alleged impropriety revealed in the spy tapes, nor did he seek the views of the prosecution team before deciding which was based on untested allegations.The DA says that Mpshe s decision was clouded by emotion, unsubstantiated facts and confusion about his own role as national director.Based on the material before him, the party says that Mpshe could not have rationally reached the decision he did.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
