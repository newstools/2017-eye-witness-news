Gungubele is part of a growing number of ANC MPs who have publicly called for President Jacob Zuma to go. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) member of Parliament Mondli Gungubele says the party's decision to charge fellow member Makhosi Khoza with ill-discipline is counterproductive and does not deal with the problem but shoots down people who raise concerns.Gungubele is part of a growing number of ANC MPs who have publicly called for President Jacob Zuma to go. He says the continued reports about Zuma are making it difficult for him to believe in the president.Mondli Gungubele has likened the ANC's decision to charge Makhosi Khoza with ill-discipline to someone ignoring an alarm system that is alerting them to a problem. The little I can say to discipline people like Makhosi at the moment in my view, it s like shooting an alarm system in an operation that is bigger than the alarm. The alarm indicates the problem, if you shoot the alarm you are saying there must be no alarm when there are challenges in your space, be it your home or so on. Gungubele says he has not changed his mind and will still vote for President Zuma to step down when the motion of no confidence is heard in Parliament in less than two weeks time.The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal charged Khoza with bringing the party into disrepute following her calls for Zuma to step down and publicly saying she would vote against him on 8 August.
