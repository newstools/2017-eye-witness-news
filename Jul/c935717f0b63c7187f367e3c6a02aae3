Speaking about her friendship with the Keep Ya Head Up hitmaker, she said: “I haven’t really told the whole story. “One of the things that are very interesting that I’ve never really said before is that when I first met Pac, when we first met, I was a drug dealer. “I won’t get into the details because I’m going to write a book about it. That’s how we started.” The 45-year-old actress admitted “something very bad” happened which prompted her to turn her life around, and she always thought the same thing would happen to Tupac one day. She said: “As I was coming out something very bad happened to me.

You saved me.’ But that just never happened to him.” But Jada insisted the pair were just friends and never involved romantically.Speaking on radio show Sway in the Morning on SiriusXM, she added: “I know that most people wanna always connect us in this romance thing, but that’s just because they don’t have the story. “It was based on survival, how we held each other down, you know what I’m saying?
