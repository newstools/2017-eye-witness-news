ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte says the SACP is not behaving as it used to. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte says that what she calls the new SACP is speaking to the media first before speaking to the party.She s also defended President Jacob Zuma s opening address at ANC s policy conference, saying that his unscripted remarks were simply an amplification of his scripted comments. They went out of step with the first half of the speech; of course, it was critical of the SACP s behavior but Gwede Mantashe was critical of the SACP as well. And she says the SACP is not behaving as it used to. The SACP has to accept that sometimes, it is better to speak in a boardroom first, fight it out; whereas the new SACP speaks to the media first. The SACP is due to discuss possibly leaving the alliance during its conference in 10 days time.Duarte s often been seen as an ally of President Zuma.WATCH: #ANCNPC Day 1: Zuma talks unity, state capture &amp; moreAt the same time, Duarte says that she agrees with all of the diagnostic report on the party that was presented on Friday by the Mantashe.She also says that while the two have differences, they agree on all the main arguments.The Sunday Times has said that the two had a screaming match in the corridors of Luthuli House after President Zuma was booed at a Cosatu rally.Duarte says she and Mantashe do differ from time to time. We work together and there are going to be days where we argue about certain things but ideologically we are not on a different page. And she claims of discord between them have an agenda. It s constat attempts to suggests that we don t work well together and frankly I must say that s absolute nonsense. But she didn t appear to deny shouting at Mantashe after the incident that saw Cosatu members booing Zuma.
