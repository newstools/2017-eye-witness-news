At least 90 personnel will be deployed to 10 policing precincts which record the highest crime rates in the metro. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has launched its Neighbourhood Safety Teams initiative to assist the Metro in its fight against gang-related crimes. The first batch of recruits will start training later this month. At least 90 personnel will be deployed to 10 policing precincts which record the highest crime rates in the metro. The city’s JP Smith says the teams will assist especially in dealing with gang-war flare-ups. “Our interventions since 2006 have helped reduce gang murders. They use to make up one-fifth of the murders in Cape Town, now they make up just over 11%. This figure is still far from satisfactory but it’s a huge improvement on where we were as a city three-years ago.”
