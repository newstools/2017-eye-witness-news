The Gauteng Health Department says this means South Africans need to work together to shrink the demand for the emergency vehicles. JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Health Department says the Democratic Alliance (DA) needs to understand that a shortage of ambulances in the province is not only a government problem but is also a societal issue. The department says that this means that South Africans need to work together to shrink the demand for the emergency vehicles. The department says that car accidents over the weekend, for instance, have increased. It says that the DA should not only look at matching numbers on the assumption that incidents will forever increase. Gauteng government operations director Kgati Malebana says that they will also raise awareness in terms of leading a healthy life. “As a province, we realise that we have an ever-increasing population due to the dynamics of Gauteng as an economic hub. And we’re not sitting back. I think we’ll never get to a point where the public sector, on its own, is able to meet the demand. But, also, it’s about looking for partnerships and a solution to drive some of the avoidable incidents.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
