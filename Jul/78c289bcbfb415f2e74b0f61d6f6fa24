On Tuesday it said it had hit targets in al-Mayadeen the previous day in a mission &quot;meticulously planned&quot; to avoid harming civilians.It says it takes great pains to avoid harming or killing civilians and investigates all reports that it has done so. The Syrian government and Russia also deny targeting civilians.The coalition is supporting an offensive by Kurdish and Arab militias against Islamic State's besieged Syrian capital of Raqqa, 200km northwest of al-Dablan up the Euphrates.
