JOHANNESBURG - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has appointed an acting CEO and CFO after James Aguma's resignation.Aguma, who filled both positions, left the public broadcaster while on suspension facing 10 charges, including interfering with the disciplinary hearings against former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng.Nomsa Philiso and Thabile Dlamini have been appointed acting CEO and CFO of the SABC respectively on a three-month contract.The public broadcaster's Kaizer Kganyago says the pair take over from Sibiso Raditapo and Audrey Raphila, who had been acting in those posts during Aguma's suspension.Kganyago says he hopes the broadcaster will appoint people to fill the positions permanently before October. We are hopeful because you must understand that the closing date for those positions was 30 June and the process of interviews has to happen.
