CAPE TOWN - Zwelinzima Vavi says his newly-formed South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) is attracting new members, while other unions are becoming irrelevant.The former Cosatu general secretary says workers have lost faith in unions and they no longer represent the needs of low-income earners, especially those working in the informal sector.He says the federation is growing in popularity since its launch in April. Municipal workers, security workers, reserves in the police and all the others are joining in their thousands. Last week we were in Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp and hospital workers there have moved to our union. We re growing very fast.
