Eskom’s chief financial officer (CFO) Anoj Singh has asked for more time to explain his luxury five-star trips to Dubai allegedly funded by the Guptas. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom’s chief financial officer (CFO) Anoj Singh has asked for more time to explain his luxury five-star trips to Dubai allegedly funded by the Guptas. On Wednesday, the power utility insisted there was nothing to warrant suspending Singh, even though he signed off a controversial pre-payment to Gupta-owned company Tegeta and reduced a R2 billion fine that the company had to pay when buying Optimum coal mine. A chain of leaked emails shows that when Singh was Transnet’s CFO, he was whisked off to Dubai on at least four occasions, stayed at five-star hotels and received luxury spa treatments that the Guptas allegedly paid for. Singh moved to Eskom along with his colleague Brian Molefe, who’s also been linked to the Gupta family. WATCH: Eskom: Why Singh hasn’t been suspended  On Wednesday, Singh told the media he’s working on a tell-all document about his Dubai trips. “I’ll certainly be in a position, in the next couple of weeks, to prepare a document that I will be sharing with the board and the minister.” The Democratic Alliance meanwhile says Singh should be the next person to leave Eskom, vowing to explore further avenues to bring him to book. Meanwhile, Eskom acting CEO Johnny Dladla says he’s asked for an independent review into the transactions made with Gupta-linked consultancy firm Trillian after admitting for the first time on Wednesday that the utility paid almost R500 million for work done. Dladla, who’s been in the acting position for just 21 days, says he's focusing on governance and leadership at Eskom and wants answers about the power utility's alleged corrupt deals. Eskom maintains it never entered into a contract with Trillian. It says its agreement was with McKinsey which then subcontracted Trillian to do work for Eskom. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
