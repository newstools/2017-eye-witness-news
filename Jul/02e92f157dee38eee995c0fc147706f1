According to the 'Daily Maverick' an amnesty proposal, which includes R2 billion payout, was put before Zuma and he made a show of dismissing the notion. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) has dismissed reports that President Jacob Zuma has apparently been offered an amnesty retirement package of R2 billion as fake news.The Daily Maverick is reporting that a faction within the ANC, which is backing Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed Zuma, has offered to raise the money in exchange for him to step down.The alleged deal could see the President being cleared of the over 700 corruption charges against him.It appears one of the ways to get Zuma out of the Union Buildings is to offer him a retirement package he cannot afford to refuse.According to the paper, this hefty amnesty proposal was put before the president and he made a show of dismissing the notion.The ANC's Zizi Kodwa says the reports are untrue. Any suggestion or insinuation that there was some negotiation of an exit package for the president are nothing but else but fake news. The party went into its fifth policy conference recently marred by fractions, allegations of state capture and calls for Zuma to step down by some party members and stalwarts.
