The NPA says it hasn't remained silent on the Gupta leak emails. JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has strongly denied the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) claims that it has a culture of selective prosecuting. The NPA says it hasn't remained silent on the Gupta leak emails and the only reason it hasn't made a decision on whether to prosecute President Jacob Zuma over Nkandla is because it still needs more information. On Tuesday, party leader Mmusi Maimane wrote to Zuma, asking him to immediately suspended NPA head advocate Shaun Abrahams, saying he wasn’t taking action over the corruption charges he'd laid against people named in the emails. The emails have detailed how people such as Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, the president’s son Duduzane Zuma and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba helped the Guptas land certain contracts. The NPA’s Luvuyo Mfaku says the DA is wrong to claim it's refusing to charge Zuma over Nkandla. “Everything has to be thoroughly investigated. Once our prosecutors are satisfied with the matter and all information needed has been collected, they will make a decision.” He denies that decisions are made for political reasons. “There is no selective prosecution in the NPA. We consider every matter in line with our policy directives.” But the DA says that it has proof that the NPA had the information it needed to make a decision about whether to charge Zuma two years ago.
