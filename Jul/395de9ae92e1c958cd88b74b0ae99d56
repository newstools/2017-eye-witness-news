ANC stalwart Frank Chikane says that the SACP has done well in highlighting the issues at hand and believes that the ANC policy conference lacked that kind of openness. JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress (ANC) stalwart Frank Chikane says he's excited about the kind of conversations coming out at the South African Communist Party’s (SACP) 14th congress. Chikane is one of the stalwarts attending the six-day conference in Boksburg this week where the Communist Party is expected to announce its newly elected leadership. Speaking to Eyewitness News on the sidelines of the conference, Chikane says that the SACP has done well in highlighting the issues at hand. He believes the ANC policy conference lacked that kind of openness. SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande warmly welcomed the stalwarts at the beginning of his address. But during his opening address at the ANC's policy conference, President Jacob Zuma lashed out at the party's stalwarts who had raised concerns about the state of the ANC under his leadership. He described their behaviour as "funny," saying the veterans think they have power. Chikane says Nziamnde's address was well received considering Zuma’s opening at the policy conference which left some stalwarts feeling insulted. “I think the president knows where he is. That was the most unfortunate things you could have ever done to the movement and people who have made sacrifices in the struggle.” Chikane also says he is excited about what’s to come from the congress, saying the SACP has shown signs of a healthy organisation.
