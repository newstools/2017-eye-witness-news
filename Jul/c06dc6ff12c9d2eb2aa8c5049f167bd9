It was not him who initiated the prepayment, it was business and the submission was done at a business level. So, we saw no need for him to be affected at that particular level. Khoza says Singh also helped Eskom when it came to terminating the contract with McKinsey.It was revealed that Gupta-linked consultancy company Trillian which was sub contracted by McKinsey was paid almost R500 million despite Eskom denying this on previous occasions.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
