Sanef has applied for a court interdict against the group in an attempt to stop the group from further harassing journalists. JOHANNESBURG - The Black First Land First Movement (BLF) says it will continue to picket outside the homes of journalists it has accused of supporting so-called white monopoly capital.The movement says it doesn t care for the South African National Editor s Forum (Sanef), the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), or the Right2Know Campaign because it says they all protect and advance white racism against black interests.Last week, the group held a protest outside journalist Peter Bruce s home. The movement has accused Bruce of often calling ministers idiots, dimwitted or using terms such as not so smart .BLF does not recognize the South African Human Rights Commission- @SAHRCommission pic.twitter.com/pVoJYoDCspSanef has applied for a court interdict against the group in an attempt to stop the group from further harassing journalists.The BLF says that it will not be taking any action against black journalists such as Karima Brown, Ferial Haffajee and Eusebius Mckaiser.The movement's president Andile Mngxitama says that Eyewitness News is the first media house to ask the movement for its own views. Stuff has been written without the movement being asked for its view at all. Now is that journalism? Not even God can protect racist journalists against BLF"s revolutionary rage. If they don't stop we continue with Protests. @SakinaKamwendoMngxitama says institutions such as Sanef, the Right2know Campaign and the Human Rights Commission exist to take care the interests of white people. It s to project this idea that corruption is a black phenomenon and white people are not involved in corruption. The SAHRC has called on the group to stop intimidating and harassing journalists.I hear Mbalula is going away for a few days. Good news; time to visit the Sunday Times. I wanna have sandwiches with one Tim Cohen gou gou.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
