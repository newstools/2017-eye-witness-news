ANC delegates at the party's policy conference have suggested that all members be allowed to make individual choices when they elect their leaders. CAPE TOWN - Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni says that a proposal by the African National Congress (ANC) to change the way its members vote is an opportunity to make the system more democratic.ANC delegates at the party's policy conference have suggested that all members be allowed to make individual choices when they elect their leaders.Fikeni says that this proposal will likely impact the culture of &quot;slate politics,&quot; which allows one faction to dominate the party's top positions. It s more likely going to allow them to democratise the system. But the issue of unity can only be unity based on principles, rather than the unity often touted to keep the organisation together.
