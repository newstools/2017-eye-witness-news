Mantashe was reacting to news that some delegates in the party have tried to have Derek Hanekom disciplined for saying calls to expropriate land were nonsense. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says that people in the party cannot be disciplined just because they disagree with other delegates.He s given his first reaction to news that some delegates in the party s economic transformation commission have tried to have former Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom disciplined for saying calls to expropriate land were nonsense.Hanekom is also the chair of the party s disciplinary committee.Mantashe says it doesn t make sense to discipline people over policy disagreements. You can t just be disciplining because you disagree. You can t discipline people because they disagree, it doesn t work that way. And he says the conference is about building unity. We don t drive a policy conference on the basis of urgency. We drive a policy conference on the basis of reaching out to each other and to come out of here more united. Mantashe is also sticking to his claim that the ANC will come out of this conference in a unified state. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
