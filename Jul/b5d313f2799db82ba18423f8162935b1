I want them to grow and take over up there. However, not everyone is as happy about the visit, as disgruntled resident Roy Tuckledoe expressed during Maimane's public address. The leader of the party behind them is a white minority. #Change19 Not everyone is happy about this campaign.Roy Tuckledoe says he isn't ANC but he isn't DA supporter either pic.twitter.com/1Ey5SCW0sbMaimane, however, did not let this rattle him. There must be a post ANC world in 2019. We can see already from their policy conference that there s no agreement between them. The tour will continue to other communities across the country.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
