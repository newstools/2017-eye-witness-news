Treasury announced on Saturday that a R2.3 billion lifeline was approved so that the airline could settle its debt with a bank. JOHANNESBURG - Parliament's standing committee on finance says the government had no choice but to bail out South African Airways (SAA).Treasury announced on Saturday that a R2.3 billion lifeline was approved so that the airline could settle its debt with Standard Chartered Bank.In a statement, Treasury said that if SAA defaulted on its debt, it would not only trigger a government guarantee but it could create the perception that the airline would not be able to pay its other bills.Chairperson of the oversight committee Yunus Carrim says there weren't many options at this stage. As unfortunate as it is, the government had no choice but to bail SAA out. But our committee is very concerned to find out what Treasury now requires of the SAA board to ensure that if functions far more effectively than the current results. Our view is that the SAA is not being managed as effectively as it should be. The national carrier has been bankrupt and surviving on state-guaranteed loans, and failing to submit its financial statements.In a statement released on Saturday, Treasury said the payment is done in terms of the Public Finance Management Act which gives Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba power to authorise the use of funds to defray expenditure of an exceptional nature.
