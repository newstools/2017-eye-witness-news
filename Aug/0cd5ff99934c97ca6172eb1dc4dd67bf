Thirty-five tourist establishments have been affected by the blaze, resulting in two and a half thousand job losses in the sector. CAPE TOWN - Officials in Knysna's tourism sector say international guests are still flocking to the Southern Cape town, despite the June firestorm. Thirty-five tourist establishments have been affected by the blaze, resulting in two and a half thousand job losses in the sector. But tour guide Chris Uys is positive the situation will soon change for the better. I m sure that things will go back to normal for our tourism industry and I think it will take more time for the people living here. A visitor has vowed to return to the region. I have a lot of friends who have already been here who gave me a positive review of the place. Meanwhile, the town s municipality is facing another potential crisis as it tries to mitigate the effects of recent wildfires.The biggest concern for authorities right now is the risk of mudslides.But they ve come up with a novel way of dealing with the problem.Charred remains of plant life can be seen topping blackened soil outside the town.This is particularly dangerous because plant life stabilises slopes. Without the plants, the slopes are more prone to mudslides.Knysna Mayor Eleanore-Bouw Spies is aware of the threat. She says they ve been consulting experts on how to avoid that possibility. Together with the environmental team, we re stabilising the slopes to prevent possible landslides. Cylindrical bags filled with alien vegetation are being fixed along the problem area.It s hoped these will shore up the slopes that could pose a danger, and remove the risk of another potential disaster.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
