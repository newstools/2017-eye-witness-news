UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says the DA has a right to table its motion but his party, like the EFF and Cope, won&#8217;t back it. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will push ahead with its plans to have Parliament dissolved to trigger early elections in spite of smaller opposition parties saying they will not support it.The DA is expected to table its motion later on Thursday. In terms of section 50 of the Constitution, the President must dissolve the National Assembly if a majority of members back such a motion and three years have passed since the last elections.But the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the United Democratic Movement (UDM) and Congress of the People (Cope) have slated the move.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says the DA has a right to table its motion but his party, like the EFF and Cope, won t back it. The DA is welcome to take their own decisions which suit their political agenda. However, I am afraid the UDM will not support (the call) for early elections. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen says they ll nevertheless press ahead. We still believe there s some lobbying to be done, we certainly believe this is in the best interests of South Africa and in the best interests of us being able to remove a corrupt government from office. Steenhuisen says the resignation of DA MPs will not force an early election and that EFF leader Julius Malema s call that the party should rather do this is based on a misreading of the Constitution.(Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
