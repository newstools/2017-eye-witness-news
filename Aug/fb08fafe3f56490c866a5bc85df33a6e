He's accused of raping the toddler, who later died of her injuries, while he working as a security guard in the Sandton area last year. JOHANNESBURG - The case against an Alexandra  man accused of the rape  and murder of a two-year-old girl has been postponed to November. Philani Mthiyane appeared in the South Gauteng High Court on Friday afternoon. He's accused of raping the toddler while working as a security guard in the Sandton area last year. She later died of her injuries. Members of the Agisanang Domestic Abuse Prevention group protested outside court on Friday, angered by what they say are delays in finalising the case. Agisanang's Thapelo Rahlogo says they want justice for the little girl. “The case was so sensitive to us as an organisation as we are working on issues of sexual violence and domestic violence. So our purpose is to oppose bail and to say justice must proceed fast because abuse against women and children is something that we don’t want.”
