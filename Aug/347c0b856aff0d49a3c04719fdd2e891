ANC KwaZulu-Natal leader Sihle Zikalala called advocate Thembeka Nguckaitobi an Economic Freedom Fighters advocate. JOHANNESBURG - The organisation Advocates for Transformation (ATF) says African National Congress (ANC) KwaZulu-Natal leader Sihle Zikalala  simply has not gone far enough in apologising to advocate Tembeka Nguckaitobi  for calling him an Economic Freedom Fighters advocate. Zikalala made the claim last week while Nguckaitobi was representing a group of ANC leaders who are challenging the outcome of the conference that saw him being elected leader. Zikalala then said he welcomed criticism for his comments and that he was explaining how ANC members were using someone who had represented other political parties. But ATF chair advocate Anthea Platt says Nguckaitobi had to follow what advocates call the "cab-rank rule" and had to represent these ANC members. “So we are available, we are bound by professional ethics to accept the brief. Irrespective of who the person is and what the matter is about.” (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
