Swift used the footage to hit out at those she feels have wronged her, including ex-boyfriend Hiddleston. LONDON - Taylor Swift hits out at Tom Hiddleston, Kim Kardashian West and Katy Perry in her new music video for Look What You Made Me Do. The 27-year-old singer unveiled the short film for at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday, and she used the footage to hit out at those she feels have wronged her, including ex-boyfriend Hiddleston. One clip shows a number of male dancers wearing crop tops with 'I [heart] TS' emblazoned on them; a clear reference to the vest top with the same slogan which Hiddleston was photographed in during their brief fling. She also appeared to take aim at West's terrifying ordeal last year, when a number of armed robbers burst into the star's Paris hotel room, tied her up and put her in the bathtub while they absconded with millions worth of jewels. As the lyrics "The role you made me play / Of the fool, no, I don't like you / I don't like your perfect crime" played, Swift could be seen lying in a bath of jewels. In the video, Swift made a reference to her recent sexual assault case by including a strategically placed dollar bill, the amount she won in her case against former DJ David Mueller, in the jewel filled bathtub. Perry, who Swift fell out with in a feud over backing dancers, also featured as Swift donned a short blonde wig, similar to Perry's current hairstyle, and crashed her car as photographers looked on. The video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who previously directed her Blank Space and Bad Blood music videos. The short movie ends with a number of versions of Swift confronting each other, as she appears to hit out at the public's perception of her. One can be heard saying: "You are so fake. There she goes playing the victim again," while another added: "I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative."
