ANC MP Derek Hanekom has called out Police Minister Fikile Mbalula for tweeting a meme linked to the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. CAPE TOWN African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MPs) Derek Hanekom has questioned Police Minister Fikile Mbalula s priorities.The Police Minister on 9 August tweeted a meme linked to the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. Mbalula challenged ANC MPs to take a lie detector test, to determine who voted with opposition parties during the vote.On 8 August, Zuma survived a no confidence vote which was held by secret ballot, with 198 MPs voting against the motion while 177 voted for Zuma to step down.This means that at least 30 ANC MPs supported the no confidence vote.Hanekom replied to Mbalula s tweet, reminding him to fight crime and corruption.Rethink this cde Mbalula. Fight crime and corruption. Take a stand on Gupta looting. Who are you trying to please? https://t.co/NHMgIcW0bmMbalula isn t the first ANC member to speak out against members who voted for Zuma to go.The ruling party s treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize has called for action against members who defied the party, saying they should face disciplinary action.ANC MP Lindiwe Zulu has also criticised some members, saying it unacceptable that they voted with the opposition.Hanekom, however, has tweeted that the ANC supported the secret ballot decision.Our organisation supported the secret ballot decision. Respect that! https://t.co/NHMgIcW0bmMbalula threatened MPs over the vote earlier last month, warning of disciplinary action if they voted with the opposition.#ANCNPC - Mbalula: There are no holy cows
