Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi is expected this morning with officials from his department and inspectors. JOHANNESBURG - Traffic is flowing freely on the N3 highway in Germiston near the Geldenhuys Interchange following the collapse of a pedestrian bridge. Five people were injured when the structure came down in the early hours of Wednesday. The road has now been declared safe after engineers spent the night removing the debris. Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi is expected this morning with officials from his department and inspectors.  The cause of the collapse is still unclear at the stage. A pile of rubble next to the highway is the only evidence of the collapsed bridge. It’s understood the bridge was built in 1978 and was regularly inspected. During the latest inspection last July, the bridge was declared safe. At the time of the collapse, the bridge was not in use. Meanwhile, the City of Ekurhuleni says its appointed a committee that will look at all other bridges in the area to ensure safety. The city's MMC for infrastructure Robert Mashego said: “We have created a committee to look into that.” (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
