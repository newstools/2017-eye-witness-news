During a parliamentary question and answer session with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, it was revealed that the national carrier is due to get yet another bailout. JOHANNESBURG - Chair of Parliament s Standing Committee on Public Accounts Themba Godi says he hopes issues at cash-strapped South African Airways (SAA) will be sorted out the same way government dealt with problems at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).During a parliamentary question and answer session with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday it was revealed that the national carrier is due to get yet another bailout, this time apparently worth R10 billion, through the sale of government s multibillion-rand stake in Telkom.Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Alf Lees dropped the bombshell when he presented a Cabinet memorandum leaked to him.SAA pays about R3.5 billion in lease costs and owns only nine of the 60 aircrafts it uses.Godi says this matter must be resolved. I m always hopeful because I believe that problems must be confronted head-on, decisively, firmly and relentlessly. We re going into SAA with an intention to have this problem solved the same way it was with SABC when it appeared to be quite bleak. LISTEN: SAA to receive R10bn bailout?(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
