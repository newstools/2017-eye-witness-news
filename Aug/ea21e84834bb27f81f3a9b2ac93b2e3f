Fedusa says getting rid of Myeni would allow the SAA board the opportunity to implement a turn-around strategy. JOHANNESBURG - The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) has called on National Treasury to drop the South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni at the airline s annual general meeting on Thursday.General secretary Dennis George says getting rid of Myeni would allow the SAA board and a new chief executive the opportunity to implement a turn-around strategy for the cash-strapped airline.George says the national carrier has been bleeding billions from Treasury for years now. SAA has deteriorated in a massive way and that s the reason why we say what is important for us is that the chairperson must step down and allow SAA under new management of the board to continue and to turn the company around.
