Khoza says the reason ANC wanted to remove Derek Hanekom is because it has taken a conscious decision that is going to suppress any moral voice within the party. JOHANNESBURG - Outspoken African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Makhosi Khoza says she believes Derek Hanekom has been given 10 days to explain why he should not be removed from his ANC committee post because the party has taken a conscious decision to suppress any moral voice.The ANC has accused Hanekom of behaving in a less than neutral manner following his tweets prior to the vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma and says he is weakening the entire disciplinary machinery of the party.Hanekom has been highly critical of state capture and said before Parliament's confidence vote that he believed ANC MPs should do the right thing.Khoza herself was sacked as chairperson of the portfolio committee on public service and administration last week.She says she believes anyone who speaks out against the ANC is in danger. I m a firm believer that part of the reason why they wanted to remove Comrade Derek Hanekom is because the ANC has taken a conscious decision that is going to suppress any moral voice within the party. 'I WILL NEVER DEFEND CORRUPTION'Khoza says she never took an oath to defend corruption and says she will never defend it. Please understand that there are millions of South Africans who are saying they re tired of this path that you are pursuing. I m saying let s listen to the people that voted us into power and if that constitutes ill-discipline, I m sorry ANC but I don t think so. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
