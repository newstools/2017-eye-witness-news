The miners are accused of killing police, security guards and non-striking workers in the days leading up to the Marikana massacre. JOHANNESBURG - Lawyers representing 18 Marikana  miners facing charges of murder have until the end of September to file a review application. The miners are accused of killing police, security guards and non-striking workers in the days leading up to the Marikana massacre in August 2012. One of the accused has since passed away and another is serving a sentence for an unrelated matter. Seventeen miners appeared in the Rustenburg magistrates court on Monday. Their lawyer Andries Mkome says that the National Prosecuting Authority isn't convinced with their argument that charges should be withdrawn. “The court is supposed to look into whether it was reasonable for Shaun Abrahams to come to the conclusion that charges against our clients should be continued.”
