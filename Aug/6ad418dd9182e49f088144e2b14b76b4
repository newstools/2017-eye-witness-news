Jose Oliveira says he isn't bothered by the constant photos and having such a well-known doppelganger has helped him out at work. CAPE TOWN - Since moving out of the White House, Barack Obama has been travelling the world. He's clocked up serious voyager miles, jetting off to places like Bali, Italy and the British Virgin Islands. Many people believe the former US president may have been enjoying some downtime in Cape Verde after “spotting” him on the island. But as it turns out people have actually been having their photos taken with dad-of-five Jose Oliveira, who happens to look a lot like the former statesman. The 43-year-old says he isn't bothered by the constant photos and questions and having such a well-known doppelganger has helped him out at work.
