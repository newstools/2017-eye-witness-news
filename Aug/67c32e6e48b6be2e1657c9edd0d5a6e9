Hanekom has been highly critical of President Jacob Zuma and had tweeted that he thought ANC MPs would do the right thing in the parliamentary confidence vote two weeks ago. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize says the party s secretary-general Gwede Mantashe is empowered to initiate processes to have ANC NEC member Derek Hanekom replaced.Hanekom has apparently been given 10 days to explain why he shouldn t be removed as chairperson of the party s disciplinary committee.A decision will be taken on the matter at the NEC.Mkhize says the party needs to act quicker against members who bring the party into disrepute. I think the discussion has been on the basis of whether there may well be a need for some of the members to be considered in the disciplinary processes, in which case, the question of their suitability to lead arises in that kind of context now. He says the matter will be dealt with at a high level. Because of the current controversies and issues that are being debated, the matter will ultimately end up serving at the NEC and they are the one to make up a decision as to where this matter must go. Hanekom has been highly critical of President Jacob Zuma and had tweeted that he thought ANC MPs would do the right thing in the parliamentary confidence vote two weeks ago.He has sharply criticised state capture and corruption in government and had spoken publicly about why ANC MPs should have done what he called the right thing during the Parliamentary vote.Now Mantashe has written to Hanekom, saying those public comments have detracted from the independence expected of him as chair of the national disciplinary committee.He says that the party s disciplinary machinery could be prejudiced if Hanekom stays on as chair because his neutrality can be questioned.Hanekom now has ten days to explain why he should be allowed to stay on.If he is removed, it may make it easier for the ANC to discipline those people who have been critical of Zuma.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
