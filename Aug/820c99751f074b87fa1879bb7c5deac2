The league says it has received reports that Angie Motshekga is organising events under the banner of the ANCWL despite not having the mandate. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Women s League (ANCWL) has accused its former president Angie Motshekga of trying to lead the organisation from the grave . The Women s League says it has received reports that Motshekga is organising events under the banner of the ANCWL despite not having the mandate. The organisation says Motshekga must stop undermining its unity and allow herself to be led. The ANCWL says its President Bathabile Dlamini will nip the signs of ill-discipline in the bud. However, Motshekga has responded to the allegations, calling them petty. Motshekga s spokesperson Troy Martens says although Motshekga is no longer the league s president, she honours invitations from gender activist event organisers. She s regularly called on to address women s forums and deal with women s issues, especially during the month of August. And she has been attending a number of these events and she intends to attend more. She s a gender activist in her own right. Motshekga says the ANCWL must focus on woman emancipation and not petty political battles.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
