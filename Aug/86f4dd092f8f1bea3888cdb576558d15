Deputy Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Manana has admitted to slapping Mandisa Duma at a nightclub in Fourways earlier this month. CAPE TOWN - The Women's Legal Centre has written to President Jacob Zuma to ask for the dismissal of deputy Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Manana.Manana has admitted to slapping Mandisa Duma at a nightclub in Fourways earlier this month.The attack followed an argument during which the woman allegedly called Manana gay.He appeared in the Randburg magistrates court last week on two charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and was released on R5,000 bail.There've been several calls for Manana to be axed, especially as the assault took place during Women s Month.The centre's Bronwyn Pithey says that failing their attempt, the centre will apply for an urgent application to be launched before the courts.&quot;We believe there are a number of issues either in the Constitution or in relation to legislation and specifically the executive ethics code that requires deputy ministers conduct themselves in a way that is consistent. We believe it is inconsistent and for the president not to act is irrational.&quot;
