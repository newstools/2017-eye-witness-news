JOHANNESBURG- Eskom has until Thursday to explain to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown its business relationship with Gupta-linked Trillian.Initially, Eskom claimed that payments of R1.6 billion to Trillian and consultancy firm McKinsey were above board but then told Business Day that a New York-based firm had in fact red flagged these transactions and recommended a legal review of the contracting process.The utility s board met on Tuesday to discuss its plan of action to deal with those who lied about payments made to Trillian.In June, Brown requested that Eskom s board clarify issues about its relationship with Trillian.Following further revelations of impropriety this week, Brown instructed the board to table a report by Thursday.The utility claimed that the Oliver Wyman firm found that payments to Trillian and McKinsey were all above board but now say this wasn't the case.Eskom has been defending its actions and those of suspended CFO Anoj Singh for some time, trying to distance itself from any links to the Gupta family.But now as evidence mounts, the utility will have to come clean about why money was paid to companies linked to the family and for what purpose.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
