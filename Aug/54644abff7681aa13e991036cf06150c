These roads have already been rolled out in India and parts of Europe. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape requested a pilot project to test the viability of so-called plastic roads. The technology uses recycled plastic to replace the component bitumen in road construction, which is derived from crude oil. These roads have already been rolled out in India and parts of Europe. However, the DA's motion was set aside in the provincial legislature last week. The party's Vicky Knoetze says a DA-run municipality in Gauteng will probe the technology. “A kilometre of this road will use about 1 million plastic bags and it will be 70% faster to build a road like this. They will also last three times longer because these roads in India and the UK are showing no signs of potholes or cracks.”
