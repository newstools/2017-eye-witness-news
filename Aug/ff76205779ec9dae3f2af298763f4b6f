Gordhan has asked the courts to rule that he isn&#8217;t legally permitted to intervene in the fight between the controversial family and the banks. JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Pretoria is expected to rule on former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's application for a declaratory order against the Gupta-owned Oakbay group of companies.Gordhan has asked the courts to rule that he isn t legally permitted to intervene in the fight between the controversial family and the banks.The country s big four financial institutions cut ties with the family s companies about a year ago, citing reputational risk.Lawyers representing the Gupta family admitted in court that Gordhan was approached by the family on numerous occasions after the banks closed their accounts, asking the then finance minister to intervene.But they ve accused Gordhan of using his office to wage a war on the family and suggested that he approach the court to air the family owned company's dirty laundry while protecting South Africa's banks from scrutiny.Gordhan's legal counsel argued it would be wrong for him or any other Cabinet member to get involved in a matter between a private bank and its customers.The minister has since been fired and the last bank providing services for the Guptas has also since stopped doing business with them.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
