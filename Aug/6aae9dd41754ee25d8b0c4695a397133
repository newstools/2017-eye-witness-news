The two pathologists who testified about injuries on Timol’s body which he probably sustained prior to the fall have been called to testify again. PRETORIA - The inquest into the death of Ahmed Timol resumes on Thursday with witnesses recalled by judge Billy Motlhe to provide clarity on discrepancies he's identified in the evidence. The anti-apartheid activist died in 1971 after falling from the 10th floor of the then John Vorster Square Police Station. Police claim he took his own life. The two pathologists who testified about injuries on Timol’s body which he probably sustained prior to the fall have been called to testify again. Last week, businessman Mohamed Thokan explained that he was witness to a body falling from the police station on the morning of Timol’s death. But the official time of death is after 4pm. Judge Motlhe has asked the pathologists to return to establish if there is any evidence available which may be able to settle this discrepancy. Former security branch sergeant Jan Rodrigues is also expected back on the stand.
