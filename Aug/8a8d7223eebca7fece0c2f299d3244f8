People took to social media taking photos of Bonang Matheba's bookâ€™s pages to expose its limitations. JOHANNESBURG - Media personality Bonang Matheba launched her book titled From A to B at a private event in Sandton and people on social media did not like what they were reading. The book is said to be a reflection of her career, the abuse she endured in her previous relationship, and her friendship with media socialite and Idols judge, Somizi Mhlongo. Those who have read it say that it is a disappointing read full of bad grammar and typos. People took to social media taking photos of the bookâ€™s pages to expose its limitations.   This is how I think Bonang should respond to her fans. #FromAtoB #BeingBonang #TweetLikeBonang #BonangxRevlon ðŸŽ¥ (Impersonation) pic.twitter.com/ZCRe6OqNcg
