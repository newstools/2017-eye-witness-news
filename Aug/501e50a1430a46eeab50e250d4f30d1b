National Council of Provinces Chairperson Thandi Modise says Manana was completely out of order for assaulting a woman. CAPE TOWN – National Council of Provinces Chairperson Thandi Modise says she's disgusted by Deputy Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Manana for assaulting a woman at Cubana nightclub in Fourways at the weekend. Manana has admitted to slapping Mandisa Duma. The assault followed an argument in which Duma allegedly called him gay.  Modise says Manana was out of order. “When you are a member of the ANC, it’s even more so your responsibility to behave. It is in the strongest terms that I am not happy with the deputy minister, he should not only apologise to the victim but to South Africa.” Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says he can’t say exactly when the deputy minister will be appearing in court. “He has been notified to appear in court because he has a case to answer to and he will appear because he is not an unknown suspect.” Mbalula has also criticised the way in which the case has been handled by police. “I’ve seen the police acting timidly where they could have on the second asked Mdu to hand himself over to police, but there was a long procedure.” At the same time, Cosatu says he should already be behind bars. The trade union federation led a picket outside the Western Cape police's headquarters in Greenpoint yesterday as part of National Women's Day. Cosatu's Freda Oosthuysen says Manana is a disgrace. “He could have handled that situation in a more matured way, nothing would have happened to him if he just walked away. To beat a woman like that is unfair and barbaric. We are very disappointed in him, especially because it’s Women’s Month.” (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
