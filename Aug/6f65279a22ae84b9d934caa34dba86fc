DA leader Mmusi Maimane was responding to the UDM's ultimatum that if Mongameli Bobani is not returned to his position, the party will withdraw as a coalition partner. CAPE TOWN - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says Mongameli Bobani, the ousted deputy mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay, cannot be reinstated.He was removed in a motion of no confidence in council on Thursday.Maimane was responding, in writing, to the United Democratic Movement s (UDM) ultimatum that if Bobani is not returned to his position, the party will withdraw as a coalition partner.The metro is governed by a coalition of the DA, UDM, Congress of the People and African Christian Democratic Party.In a letter addressed to UDM leader Bantu Holomisa, Maimane made it clear his party would not work with Bobani.He suggested the UDM nominate another councillor to serve on the mayoral committee.But Holomisa has stuck to his guns. I saw that letter and it s good that he s rejecting our ultimatum. So he must kiss and say bye bye to the coalition of the UDM. The DA has accused Bobani of undermining the coalition agreement by voting with the African National Congress in Council on numerous occasions.The party claims two separate forensic reports have found prima facie evidence of maladministration, fraud, and tender irregularities involving departments directly under Bobani's political watch.But the UDM has pointed out that it's &quot;yet to see a line that implicates Bobani&quot; in corruption after scanning a PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which was sent to the coalition partners this week.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
