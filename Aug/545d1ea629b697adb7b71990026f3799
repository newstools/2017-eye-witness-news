JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's ex-wife Hope Ramaphosa has told Eyewitness News that he never laid a hand on her during their relationship.On Monday night, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema said during an interview that African National Congress Women s League leader Bathabile Dlamini was referring to Ramaphosa when she claimed some male leaders had behaved worse than deputy Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Manana.Dlamini has said she is supporting Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in the ANC s leadership contest.Hope Ramaphosa says she couldn t believe Malema could say these things in public. I m absolutely shocked that someone in his capacity as a leader could do that. My first reaction was shock. She says it s simply not true to claim that her ex-husband ever assaulted her. Cyril would rather negotiate or do things amicably than beat them up. I was his wife and girlfriend for a very long time, Cyril would not beat up a woman. He is very sensitive to women s issues. She says that despite the break-up of their marriage, she still hopes that he becomes the country s next president.
