The bookstore says it's noted the public’s response to the book and readers who purchased their copies from its stores can return them for full refunds. JOHANNESBURG – Bonang Matheba’s book From A to B is being recalled by Exclusive Books. The bookstore said in a tweet on Tuesday that it's noted the public’s response to the book and readers who purchased their copies from its stores can return them for full refunds.  Readers took to social media criticising the book on Matheba’s life, exposing spelling, grammatical and factual errors.  Exclusive Book’s CEO, Benjamin Trisk said: "It was too much to launch and promote a book at which a number of people expressed dissatisfaction. And we think that it's right and fair that people get a full refund. I have spoken to the publisher who has assured me that they will reprint a corrected version." Trisk says the publishers, Blackbird Books, were rectifying the errors and it would consider stocking the republished version. The book chain says it is still negotiating with the publishers of Matheba's book as to who will bear the costs of the recall. Trisk has encouraged the returns, saying the business remains customer oriented. “That’s still in negotiation between us and the publisher. But as far as the customer is concerned they shouldn’t mind because we will stand by the refund policy.”
