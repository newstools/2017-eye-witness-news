The ANC says it conducted a performance assessment into the coalition&#8217;s promises one year into office. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg has given the Democratic Alliance (DA)- led coalition a 20% score and Mayor Herman Mashaba an H for his performance, saying the government has failed dismally on its promises of change.The opposition party says it conducted a performance assessment into the coalition s promises one year into office.Earlier this month, the DA marked exactly a year since it control of key metros in Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay from the ANC in coalitions with other opposition parties.While the DA says the municipalities were handed over in a mess besieged by corruption, the ANC s Jolidee Matongo says it's actually the opposite. We ve handed them a well-run administration but as we speak today, communities are experiencing serious problems of deterioration in terms of service delivery. The opposition party says the DA promised 5% economic growth when it came into power but says one year on, this still hasn t materialised.It also claims that the city s financial situation has deteriorated, with City Power and Joburg Water regularly dipping into overdraft.(Edited by Winnie Thelestane)
