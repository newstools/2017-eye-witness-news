Mzwanele Manyi says the ANN7 and 'The New Age' will tell the news as it is and will even report on the Guptas JOHANNESBURG - Former government spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi says his newly acquired companies ANN7 and The New Age will report objectively, even on the Guptas.Manyi's company Lodidox has bought the two media agencies for R450 million through vendor financing.Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments says the sale is part of its commitment to preserve jobs and provide certainty to more than 7,500 employees.The former government spin doctor says ANN7 and The New Age will tell the news as it is, saying he's determined to bring these organisations out of toxic environments. They ve got assets here that were in a kind of toxic environment so I m going to take them out of the toxicity now. Manyi says the media companies will also report on the Guptas. Without a doubt, they will be reported on. In fact, you just might see Atul [Gupta] himself coming to face the media. He will be paying back the Guptas as he was unable to secure funds to directly purchase the media companies. NOT DEALING WITH OUTLAWS Manyi has again defended the Gupta family, saying that last week's High Court ruling reassured him that he is not dealing with outlaws .The High Court dismissed former finance minister Pravin Gordhan's application for a declaratory order on Friday, which he sought in order to state that he didn't have the legal authority to intervene in the dispute between Gupta owned companies and the banks.He says he's not new to the media industry, having run government's communication system and he's excited about growing ANN7 and The New Age.Manyi says despite what has been said about the Guptas, the ruling reassured him that he had made the right decision in buying these media agencies. The business is very good, it boosts of confidence that I m not dealing with outlaws. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
