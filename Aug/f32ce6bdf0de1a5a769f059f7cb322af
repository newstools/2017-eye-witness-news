Mmusi Maimane says opposition parties have been meeting to find a way to co-operate with each other should the motion of no confidence against President Zuma succeed. JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says opposition parties in Parliament have been meeting to find a way to co-operate with each other after Tuesday, should the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma succeed.Maimane spoke to Eyewitness News in Soweto earlier on Thursday where the party marked exactly a year since it took control of Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay from the African National Congress (ANC) in cooperation with other opposition parties.While the Constitutional Court has clarified that National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete is empowered by the rules of Parliament to allow for a secret ballot, she is yet to make a decision on the matter.Should the motion of no confidence in the president succeed, his Cabinet would be forced to resign and the Speaker of Parliament would become president for 30 days.Parliament would then have to reconvene and elect a new president, who must then constitute a new Cabinet.Without saying whether opposition parties agreed on who they would want as president if the motion succeeds, Maimane says parties are weighing their options. On Wednesday, I was at a leaders meeting, where the discussions were about how best we cooperate and even looking at the motion of no confidence and what we do subsequent to that. Maimane says there is a sense among opposition party leaders that getting a post-ANC universe would be better for South Africa, adding that if the parties agree on a government program, they can form a coalition for elections in 2019.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
