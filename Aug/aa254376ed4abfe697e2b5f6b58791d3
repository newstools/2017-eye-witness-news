The result of last Tuesday's vote indicates that more than 20 ANC MPs must have voted against President Jacob Zuma, prompting calls that they be disciplined. CAPE TOWN - Parliament says last week's secret ballot process was beyond reproach and there's no way of identifying how Members of Parliament (MPs) voted.This comes in the wake of widespread calls within the African National Congress (ANC) to charge those who voted in favour of a Democratic Alliance-sponsored no confidence motion in President Jacob Zuma.The United Democratic Movement took their battle for a secret ballot all the way to the Constitutional Court to ensure MPs voted with their conscience, and not out of fear.Parliament says its confidentiality measures were rigorous.The result of last Tuesday's vote indicates that more than 20 ANC MPs must have voted against President Zuma, prompting calls from Zuma himself and others that they be disciplined.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Parliament said given the public debate on how certain MPs voted, it wanted to reaffirm that it was impossible to trace the identity of the voters.The ballot only contained three options: no, yes or abstain.Parliament spokesman Moloto Mothapo says similar confidentiality measures were employed during last week's vote, as those employed since 1994 for the election of the president and presiding officers. We believe that that seeks to undermine or to question the process that has been followed. In particular the secrecy or the confidential nature of it. The ballot boxes are being stored under lock and key in the archive, which may only be opened by order of the Speaker or a court of law.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
