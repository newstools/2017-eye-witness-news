Gwede Mantashe says the ANC will not go on a witch hunt to find which MPs disobeyed the party&#8217;s whip and voted against retaining Jacob Zuma as president. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says the party will not go on a witch hunt to find which MPs disobeyed the party s whip and voted against retaining Jacob Zuma as president.But he says the party will have to invoke procedures against those who have said in public that they voted against the motion.Around 30 ANC MPs defied party instructions last week, which led to calls from the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State for them to be disciplined.Mantashe says the party does need to take some action. At least three MPs have confirmed that they voted with the opposition. We ll have to deal with that situation because if we don t, we ll be destroying the essence of being an organisation. ANC S RULES ARE NOT ABOVE THE CONSTITUTION With some ANC structures on a campaign to uncover which MPs voted with the opposition in the no confidence secret ballot, MP Mathole Motshekga says the party s rules are not above the Constitution.Those who went against party lines have been condemned, with ANC Treasurer-General Zweli Mkhize saying that they should in principle be disciplined.The former ANC chief whip says that being a loyal, disciplined member of the ANC doesn t allow one to violate the Constitution.He says the governing party should take what happened in Parliament last week as a wake-up call.Motshekga says that he believes the party will come out stronger in its December elective conference as the majority of the members have realised they can t gamble with the country.Additional reporting by Thando Kubheka.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
