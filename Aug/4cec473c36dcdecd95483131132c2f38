JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma's son, Edward, is reported to have heckled African National Congress (ANC) parliamentarian Pravin Gordhan during a lecture in Pietermaritzburg. Gordhan used his speech during the Gandhi memorial lecture on Friday night to condemn the looting of state coffers. #EdwardZuma The KZN ANC has backtracked on its earlier confirmation and now says there has been an apology received from Zuma today.ZN pic.twitter.com/ySOqUmxLycBut the gathering was interrupted by a group of protesters waving placards labelling Gordhan a stooge of white monopoly capital.Gordhan told the audience that South Africa is not for sale. So hopefully the part-time paying members that are here will take that message back; we re not for sale. We re here to achieve the ambition and escalation set out in the preamble of the constitution of this country. Gordhan was fired as finance minister during a reshuffle of President Zuma's Cabinet in March.Earlier this month, Edward Zuma apologised for his comments penned in an open letter about MPs Gordhan and Derek Hanekom, in which he accuses them of defending white monopoly capital.In his open letter, the president s son described Hanekom as a white Afrikaner askari and Gordhan as a stooge for white monopoly capital. In his apology, Zuma says it was never his intention to offend anyone by expressing his view of the current political landscape and withdraws words that may have caused harm.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
