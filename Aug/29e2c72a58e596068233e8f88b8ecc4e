JOHANNESBURG - Lonmin has proposed a design for a Marikana Memorial Park to be constructed as a social gathering space near the area where miners lost their lives in 2012.Wednesday marks exactly five years since 34 miners were gunned down by police at the platinum mine; 10 others, including security guards and police, were also killed during the violent strike the week before.Lonmin has unveiled its idea for a memorial park in Marikana which will be designed around the concept of a green blanket, the garment worn by one of the strike leaders in 2012.The mining company says this 'green space' planted with indigenous trees will serve as a social gathering space for the community and will stretch over three koppies to signify new hope.The miners gathered at one of the koppies five years ago, during the violent and unprotected strike which saw 44 people being killed.Later additions to the site may include an amphitheatre, a museum showcasing the history of platinum mining and detailing the events of the tragedy.#Marikana Lonmin's design plan for a memorial park: pic.twitter.com/NCQpxcCzE2APARTMENTSLonmin has launched the first two phases of its new apartment project at its Marikana mine to ensure there's adequate housing for employees.Lonmin has unveiled its apartment project close to the company's hostel family units.The development, which cost R410 million as part of its R500 million social labour plan, already has 493 apartments occupied mainly by other employees.A further 300 units are under construction and will be ready by December.Poor living conditions were highlighted during the mass shooting in Marikana in 2012.On Wednesday, hundreds of people are expected to gather in the area to pay tribute to those who lost their lives five years ago.#Marikana Phase 1 & 2 of Lonmin's infill apartments: pic.twitter.com/9YV0eWldPc(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
