CAPE TOWN - Plans to erect a statue of Nelson Mandela at City Hall are to be approved by council this week. The statue is to be placed on the balcony where the late statesman delivered his first speech after his release from prison in 1990. The artwork will be donated to the City of Cape Town by the provincial government, which will pay for all costs related to its design and development. From an initial proposal in 2013 to erect a statue of Madiba in the Company's Gardens, the mayoral committee has approved a recommendation from the city's naming committee, for the statue to overlook the Grand Parade instead. There is already a Mandela statue at the Waterfront, a bust at Parliament and a smaller one inside the City Hall. The biggest statue in the province is outside Drakenstein Prison in Paarl where the icon spent the last years of his incarceration. Mayco member Brett Herron said: “The idea is for us to create a tourism experience at the City Hall in celebration of the national heritage liberation route. National Department of Tourism has developed an App for tourists to use and follow in the liberation footsteps.” The city hopes the statue will be completed by Mandela Day, on 18 July, next year.
