The party says this means the association has agreed that the public relations (PR) firm did indeed violate its professional charter. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has confirmed that its complaint against Bell Pottinger has been upheld by the United Kingdom's Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA). The party says that this means that the association has agreed that the public relations (PR) firm did indeed violate its professional charter. In July, the DA lodged a complaint with the regulator, accusing Bell Pottinger of trying to stir racial tension in South Africa through campaigns for the Gupta-owned Oakbay. The PR agency has five days to appeal the ruling and the final decision will be announced by the PRCA's board early September. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
