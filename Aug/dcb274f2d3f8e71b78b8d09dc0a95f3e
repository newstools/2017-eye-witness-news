Deputy Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Manana has admitted to slapping Mandisa Duma at the Cubana nightclub in Fourways, north of Johannesburg over the weekend. JOHANNESBURG – On Women’s Day, a woman who was assaulted by deputy Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Manana says she doesn’t accept his apology because he has not said sorry to her personally and doesn’t mention the other women he allegedly also hit. Manana has admitted to slapping Mandisa Duma at the Cubana nightclub in Fourways, north of Johannesburg over the weekend. The assault followed an argument in which the woman allegedly called Manana gay. Duma says Manana’s apology just doesn’t cut it. “I don’t accept it. He only apologised to me when he knows very well he hit other women and not me, so why is he only apologising to me? And he didn’t apologise to me personally.” Duma says she is doing better now. “I’m well, I’m at home just resting my body but I’ll be fine.” She says she has no choice but to trust that police will do their job. “I’ll just give them the benefit of the doubt and see how it goes.” It’s unclear whether Manana will face any action against him from his department.
