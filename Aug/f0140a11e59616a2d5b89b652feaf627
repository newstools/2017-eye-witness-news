JOHANNESBURG - The Competition Commission has launched a market inquiry into the perceived 'excessive' cost of data in South Africa.The regulator's Sipho Ngwema says the commission has initiated the inquiry because it believes there are features in the market that prevent, distort or restrict competition.The commission says it aims to compare data service pricing in South Africa with other countries in an effort to identify the precise factors that give rise to apparent high prices.The inquiry follows last month s request from Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel who publicly expressed concern about the seemingly exorbitant cost of data.According to a 2016 World Bank report, South Africa has one of the highest prices per gigabyte on the continent.
