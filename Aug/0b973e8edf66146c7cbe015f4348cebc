President Zuma's Q&amp;A was delayed by about 30 minutes before taking to the podium after members of the EFF rose on repeated points of order. JOHANNESBURG - Chants of answer the question have resounded through the National Assembly where President Jacob Zuma has been accused of failing to answer a question about whether he's abused his position to channel contracts to family members.Zuma was delayed by about 30 minutes before taking to the podium after members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) rose on repeated points of order, challenging his right to appear in Parliament at all following the Constitutional Court finding he broke his oath of office.It's the first time that the EFF has attended one of Zuma's oral reply sessions since declaring him a constitutional delinquent and an illegitimate president.Zuma first denied abusing his office to enrich members of his family. I wish to make it categorically clear that I have never instructed or directed any state institution to give contracts to anyone whatsoever. #ZumaQnA Zuma:want to make it categorically clear that I have never instructed any state institution to give contracts to anyone whatsoever.#ZumaQnA Zuma: I've never sat in a meeting with anyone asking them to help Duduzane. LDDemocratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane asked a follow-up question. Yet there is an affidavit tabled by Mr Brent Simmons saying he was present at meetings where you requested for relatives that you know to be given particular contracts. Now, clarify for us, who is lying to South Africa? Is it Mr Simmons and if he is lying, are you going to take legal action against him or are you, in fact, Mr President misleading South Africans about not helping your family members to get contracts in the state? The President drew criticism when he refused to say whether or not he would take legal action against Simmons, who worked in the Department of Public Service and Administration.According to reports, Simmons sent National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete s office a sworn affidavit earlier this month detailing why he believes the president has been lying to Parliament about helping his relatives.Simmons claims to have seen Zuma directing his family members to the late Collins Chabane, who was Minister of Public Service and Administration at the time.Zuma told him he'd already answered the question, causing uproar.WATCH: President Jacob Zuma's Q&amp;A session
