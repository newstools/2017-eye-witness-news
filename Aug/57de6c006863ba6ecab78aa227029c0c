MP Makhosi Khoza was vocal about her support for a secret ballot during last week's motion of no confidence in the president. CAPE TOWN - Lobby group the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) says although it's the African National Congress' (ANC) prerogative to reshuffle Member of Parliament (MPs) in parliamentary committees, the removal of Makhosi Khoza as chairperson of the Public Service and Administration committee appears to be reprisal for her criticism of the party's leadership.Khoza was vocal about her support for a secret ballot during last week's motion of no confidence in the President.Since then, five ANC members of the committee refused to be led by her.Casac's Lawson Naidoo said: In the context of the politics that has been playing out recently and the fact that Dr Khoza had been an outspoken critic of the leadership of her own party, the ruling party, I think it can be seen in that light that it is a reprisal against her. ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu's office said Khoza had alienated her ruling party colleagues.
