The couple's two-month-old marriage was cut short when Masilela was killed during an attempted hijacking in Tembisa last week.  Mourners gathered at the Hope Restoration Church in Kempton Park yesterday for the Rhythm City actor's memorial. Ngema says her husband's death has been immensely painful and that he was the only person who understood her. “Dumi was perfect, he was one of the perfect people who never worried about anything.”
