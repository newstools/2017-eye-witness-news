The police service has accused the strikers of damaging property and intimidate non-striking workers while demanding higher wages. JOHANNESBURG - The Labour Court in Johannesburg has granted the South African Police Services (SAPS) an order barring striking 10111 call centre agents from intimidating colleagues who are still reporting for duty. The police service has accused the strikers of damaging property while demonstrating for higher wages. Police union Sapu has denied the claims. The call centre staff are demanding wages that are in line with those of colleagues at other government phone centres. SAPS spokesperson Sally de Beer says they are still committed to resolving the dispute. “The SAPS continue to have contingency plans in place in all 10111 call centres across the country as we’re committed to ensuring that we deliver a service to our communities.” Workers representative Bethuel Nkuna says they won't return to their posts until their grievances have been addressed. “We hope the engagement can yield good results because this thing has been dragging for so long and it’s not supposed to.”
