CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma says you can t blame the country s economic problems on his decisions to reshuffle finance ministers.He was answering questions in the National Assembly on Thursday afternoon.Zuma axed Nhlanhla Nene in December 2015 and replaced him with Des van Rooyen, who lasted four days before Zuma brought Pravin Gordhan back.But Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were then fired in Zuma s March Cabinet reshuffle and South Africa was downgraded to junk status a short while later.A question from Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane for President Zuma: Do you not believe it s about time you make a coherent policy process and stop the business of recycling Finance Ministers or maybe give the nation reasons why you keep changing Finance Ministers? Maimane also asked: Are we ever going to get to a point where we bring stability to policy and leadership in this country under your tenure? But Zuma was adamant that the global economic meltdown of 2008 is to blame for the state South Africa s economy is in. You can t pin down the economic position of South Africa to the removal of a minister in other countries, there was no minister taken out and the economies were down, some of them were at a point where it was very difficult. Zuma s also told MPs that South African Airways has a history of problems and that the airline s failings can t be blamed on board chairperson Dudu Myeni.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
