Private investigator Paul O&#8217;Sullivan was detained for several hours at the Kameeldrift Police station on Monday night. PRETORIA Forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan has opened criminal cases against the police officers who arrested him on contravention of a court order. O Sullivan was detained for several hours at the Kameeldrift Police Station on Monday night, before the High Court in Pretoria ordered his release. The police contravened a court order obtained in November which requires the authorities to give the investigator 48 hours notice to present himself at a police station if he is to be arrested. The private investigator is the complainant in a corruption case against acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane, who is being investigated by police watchdog the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.O Sullivan has produced transcripts of videos made on the scene when he was arrested in which attorney Willie Spies reads out the court order to the arresting officer. The officer then proceeds to arrest O Sullivan. He says, in an affidavit, that despite it being pointed out to the arresting officer that his conduct was unlawful, he persisted. O Sullivan says he believes he s being punished for exposing the alleged corruption of Lieutenant General Phahlane. On Thursday, the police issued a statement confirming O Sullivan s appearance in court, noting that he is out on bail on four other criminal matters, including extortion, kidnapping and fraud.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
