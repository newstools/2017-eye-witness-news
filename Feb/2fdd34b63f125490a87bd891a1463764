Lawyers say Mawarire should be released around midday though it&#8217;s not inconceivable that there could be slight delays. HARARE Zimbabwe s protest pastor Evan Mawarire is expected to walk free from prison in a few hours, a day after a court granted him bail.The leader of the ThisFlag movement was arrested last Wednesday when he flew in to Zimbabwe from South Africa after six months in exile.Lawyers say Mawarire should be released around midday though it s not inconceivable that there could be slight delays.They have to hand his passport over and lodge $300 bail money under the conditions imposed by a High Court judge on Wednesday.But Mawarire s court days are far from over.The charges he faces of trying to overthrow President Robert Mugabe s government haven t been dismissed and he s still due to appear in court. Will the fact that he s free for now give Zimbabweans fresh hope in the rule of law?That remains to be seen.
