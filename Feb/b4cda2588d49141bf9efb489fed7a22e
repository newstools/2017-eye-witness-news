The civil society group has called on the public to reject and protest against the appointment of Brain Molefe to Parliament. JOHANNESBURG - Civil society organisation Save South Africa has called on the public to reject and protest against the appointment of Brain Molefe to Parliament.The African National Congress (ANC) in the National Assembly has confirmed that Molefe was sworn in on Thursday morning.While it was the North West ANC that nominated the former Eskom CEO, confusion about his membership was created when another ANC branch in Gauteng also claimed Molefe was signed up with them.Just four months ago, Molefe left Eskom under a cloud after Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found in her State of Capture report that he had communicated regularly with one of the Gupta brothers and had visited the controversial family s compound in Saxonworld 19 times, while they were negotiating to buy a coal mine that supplies Eskom.Full Copy of #savesa Press Release on Brian Molefe&#39;s Appointment as an MP. #notostatecapture pic.twitter.com/HNIBOfWQaUSave SA s Lawson Naidoo says it s because of this that they are against his appointment to Parliament. It s a near overstatement to say that Molefe s appointment marks a potential turning point for the state capture project and it must be stopped. He says the civil society group will mobilise South Africans to protest what Save SA calls a move by the architects of state capture.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
