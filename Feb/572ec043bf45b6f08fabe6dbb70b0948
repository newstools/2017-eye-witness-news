The DA Cape Town Chairperson is currently seeking legal advice and is confident investigations will not affect his campaign. CAPE TOWN - An investigation into Democratic Alliance (DA) Cape Town Chairperson Shaun August's role in the leaking of documents could deal a blow to his ambitions of becoming the party's Western Cape leader.But August, who is currently seeking legal advice over the DA probe, is confident this will not affect his campaign.He, along with former DA Western Cape leader Patricia de Lille and a City of Cape Town researcher, are the subjects of an internal investigation into the leaking of August's disciplinary report that was apparently confidential.August will go up against four others, including current acting provincial party leader Bonginkosi Madikizela and former MEC Lennit Max, for the vacant position on Saturday.August already has a cloud hanging over his head after the party found him guilty of breaking internal procurement rules.The latest probe could prove to be a major setback for his campaign.But the former Independent Democrats man says his bid remains strong. We are soldiering on with our campaign. We are looking very good, we are positive. This is a side-track and we will deal with it. Meanwhile, de Lille would not speak on the allegations as she is consulting lawyers after receiving a letter notifying her of the investigation.De Lille announced her resignation as Western Cape leader last month, saying she wanted to focus on her role as mayor. She denied she was forced out of her DA role.(Edited by Neo Koza)
