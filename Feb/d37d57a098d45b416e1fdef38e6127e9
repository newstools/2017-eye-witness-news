Opposition parties have rejected Gauteng Premier David Makhura&#8217;s claim that the decision to move mentally ill patients from Life Esidimeni was not made in consultation with his office. RANDFONTEIN - Opposition parties have once again rejected Gauteng Premier David Makhura s claim that the decision to move mentally ill patients from Life Esidimeni was not made in consultation with his office, with some saying he should have announced his resignation on Monday during his State of the Province Address. At least 100 patients died after being transferred to various NGOs in the province which were later found to have been operating unlawfully. Former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu resigned just before the Health Ombudsman released his report into the tragedy and other senior departmental officials have been placed on precautionary suspension. Premier Makhura says important facts were deliberately kept away from him by officials in the Gauteng Health Department regarding the move of mentally ill patients from Life Esidimeni. Those responsible for this tragic and ill-fated transfer of patients have tried to hide the facts and information from me, from the minister of health as well as the health ombudsman. But the Democratic Alliance s Jack Bloom says Makhura s claim that he was unaware simply cannot be true. I m actually very disappointed that he claims he didn t know that patients were going to be sent to NGOs. I cannot frankly see that true. The Economic Freedom Fighters Masilela Ledwaba says the premier should ve resigned. He failed to do the honourable thing. We were expecting him to do step down. Makhura says he and the executive council would never have approved the plan to outsource mental healthcare to unregistered NGOs.READ: The Health Ombudsman's final report on Esidimeni Life Esidimeni Report - Office of the Health Ombud by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
