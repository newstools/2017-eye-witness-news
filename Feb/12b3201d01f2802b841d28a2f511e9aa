NEW YORK - American President Donald Trump held a news conference at the White House on Thursday in which he defended his first month in office while promising to issue a new order to replace the travel ban that he tried to put in place to prevent Muslims from certain countries entering the US.It was a press conference that was meant to announce Trump s new pick for labour secretary, instead it derailed into a marathon session in which Trump lambasted the press and stunned the public. I don t think there s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we have done. Much of the media doesn t get it. The press, honestly, is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. One reporter challenged his insistence false claim that he won the electoral college by the biggest margin since Ronald Reagan. I was told. I was given that information, said Trump.The conference follows the controversial resignation of Trump s national secretary adviser earlier this week.(Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
