We have been staying here with foreigners for centuries, some have come and settled here. We don t have refugee camps in South Africa. Foreigners stay with us; they aren t separated or segregated. He says Africans are treated differently to Europeans. Wherein the refugees that enter countries say they can t come in, nobody wants them. Nobody says they are xenophobic. It s just like if there is something wrong with Africans it's (called) corruption but if it is done not by us it's collusion . Zuma says South Africans shouldn t be incorrectly portrayed as being xenophobic.
