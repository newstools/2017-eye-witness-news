Rumford is keen to be one of those eight.&quot;That's one less lottery round you have to deal with, isn't it?&quot; Rumford said. &quot;That's definitely a huge bonus qualifying inside that top eight, so it's definitely something I am thinking about.&quot;That's why it's going to be so unique and so interesting as well. There's sort of cuts within cuts this week.&quot;
