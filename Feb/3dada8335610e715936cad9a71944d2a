Setlamorago Thobejane says the ANC still doesn't deal properly with the land currently controlled by traditional leaders. JOHANNESBURG President of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of SA (Contralesa) Kgosi Setlamorago Thobejane says he's resigned as an African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) and from the ANC because the party has not given his people proper control over their land.Thobejane resigned yesterday as Contralesa is starting a process of deciding whether it should stop supporting the ANC.He says that the ANC keeps saying the land issue is complicated, but it still doesn't deal properly with the land currently controlled by traditional leaders. What is complicated about the land that the traditional leaders and community members reside on? There are already there. The only snag is once you give them that land, it has its own benefits. He adds Contralesa is now starting a process of consulting with all of its members and communities about whether it should still help the ANC. If they want us to form a political party that will be characterised by the African value system, then let it be.
