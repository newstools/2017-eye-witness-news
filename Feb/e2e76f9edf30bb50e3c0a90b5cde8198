In England's tournament victories over France &amp; Wales, Te'o scored the match-winning try &amp; was handed a debut start after earning five caps. LONDON - Ben Te'o will make his first international start after being named at outside centre for England in Sunday's Six Nations clash against Italy at Twickenham, one of four changes to the team who beat Wales two weeks ago.Te'o looked impressive off the bench in England's tournament opening victories over France, where he scored the match-winning try, and Wales, and was handed a debut start by coach Eddie Jones on Friday after earning five caps as a replacement.Jonny May returns on the right wing, Danny Care replaces Ben Youngs as starting scrumhalf and James Haskell is recalled at openside flanker, completing his return to full fitness after recovering from toe surgery.Prop Mako Vunipola has returned from a lengthy knee injury-layoff for a place on the bench.There had been speculation that Owen Farrell could switch to his club position of flyhalf but he remains at inside centre in a muscular midfield and will earn his 50th cap, having made his debut at the start of the 2012 Six Nations.Te'o (30) was born in New Zealand with a Samoan father and English mother. He moved to Australia as a teenager and forged an impressive career in rugby league in the NRL, also playing internationally for Samoa.In 2013 he switched codes, joining Irish province Leinster, before moving again to English Premiership club Worcester at the start of this season.His powerful running and muscular ball-carrying is in contrast to the silky Jonathan Joseph, Jones' regular outside centre, who was dropped from the squad for Sunday's game.&quot;Ben Te'o at 13 gives us another way of playing the game and we are excited about seeing him, George Ford and Owen Farrell play together in the midfield,&quot; Jones said in a statement.&quot;Ben Youngs has been outstanding for us at number nine, but Danny Care gets the starting jersey this week. For the first half he'll give us a lot of speed and running at the base of the ruck as well as the scrum. Ben will then come on and finish the game.&quot;Tom Wood has been great for us at seven, and Jack Clifford did well against Wales, but James Haskell has the starting role on Sunday; he has come back to a much better level of fitness and we are sure his explosive actions will help us in the first part of the game.&quot;England, on a 16-match winning streak and targeting back-to-back grand slams, will expect a hefty bonus point win over Italy, a side they have beaten in all 22 previous meetings by an average margin of almost 30 points.The Italians were thumped by Wales and Ireland in their opening home games and have yet to score a second-half point in the championship this season.
