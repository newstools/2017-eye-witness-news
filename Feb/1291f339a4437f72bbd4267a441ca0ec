The dispute relates to a state car that was damaged in an accident while Thuli Madonsela's son was driving in 2012. JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she is disappointed at the peddling of false information in the public domain following reports that a decision to withhold a portion of her predecessor s pension pay-out was deliberate.Last week, her predecessor Thuli Madonsela publically hit out at Mkhwebane for what she described as fake news and lies .The dispute relates to a state car that was damaged in an accident while her son was driving in 2012.Added to this, Mkhwebane has also accused Madonsela of abusing another state car by continuing to use it even after she had left office.Advocate Madonsela insists she is not liable for the costs linked to an accident involving her son after being exonerated by the Auditor General last year.Madonsela also says the SAPS VIP Protection Unit granted her permission to use the state car after her term.Her successor, Advocate Mkhwebane acknowledges this, saying she was not privy to this information because all communication was done with the CEO who has since resigned.Spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says Mkhwebane insists there are no sinister motives behind the reduction of Madonsela s pension fund. The legal opinion has been sought from the Office of the State Attorney to clarify if indeed Advocate Madonsela is liable for the costs. The Public Protector says if legal opinion proves that Madonsela cannot be held liable for costs, they will release the funds to her.Segalwe adds, In the event that legal opinion indicates that Advocate Madonsela cannot be held liable for the costs, the money will be released to her. The Public Protector would like to stress that there are no sinister motives behind this action.
