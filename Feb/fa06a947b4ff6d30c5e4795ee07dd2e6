JOHANNESBURG Gauteng Finance MEC Barbara Creecy says while MECs have the executive authority to carry out their mandate, when decisions have wide-reaching consequences they should be brought before the council.On Monday, Premier David Makhura delivered the State of the Province Address where he announced that memorial stones will be put up at Freedom Park in Pretoria to remember the over 100 psychiatric patients who were transferred from Life Esidimeni.Creecy says the move was not scrutinised by the executive council, which could have been able to make different recommendations. When we want to take decisions that could have far-reaching implications for citizens, those decisions must be brought to the executive council. That is the formal decision-making place in government and it s important to draw on the wisdom of your colleagues when you want to make far-reaching decisions. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance s John Moody says it is unacceptable that the premier has absolved himself of any responsibility for the tragedy, and believes he should do the honourable thing and step down. We have documented evidence that his office was informed, him personally, and via email from students at the University of Johannesburg amongst a whole lot of others including ourselves as the opposition in parties who raised our concerns in the house, and he was there in the house.
