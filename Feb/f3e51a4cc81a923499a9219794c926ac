Kholekile Lange was arrested for allegedly submitting fictitious travel claims on a vehicle that does not belong to him. CAPE TOWN - The Speaker of an Eastern Cape council facing fraud charges could also contend with a no-confidence motion just six months after taking office. A Hawks task team established to tackle corruption in Eastern Cape municipalities pounced on Kholekile Lange during a Walter Sisulu Municipality council meeting last week. Lange was arrested for allegedly submitting fictitious travel claims on a vehicle that does not belong to him. Democratic Alliance councillor Matthee Nel says the Speaker should step down on his own or the party will push for him to be removed. At the end of March, because that is when our council meeting is taking place again and that is when we will place a motion of no confidence against the Speaker. The Economic Freedom Fighters in the council have called for an investigation into Lange and will support a motion of no confidence. The African National Congress, however, has a majority in the council and it's unclear if they'll vote for Lange's removal.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
