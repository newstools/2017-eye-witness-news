Despite guiding the Springboks to just four wins in 2016, Coetzee will continue to coach the side, with no timeline given as to when his contract expires. JOHANNESBURG - Allister Coetzee has been retained as Springbok coach, with the Executive Council of SA Rugby announcing the coaching and management structure for eight national teams, involving 46 individuals.Despite guiding the Springboks to just four wins in 2016, which proved to be the Springboks worst ever year results-wise, Coetzee will continue to coach the side, with no timeline given as to when his contract expires.Cheetahs coach Franco Smith was confirmed as a new member of the coaching team while a new defensive coach will be confirmed once contractual details are finalised.Johan Ackermann will continue as coach of the SA A team while Chean Roux has been appointed as head coach of the Junior Springbok team.Last year s Bok backline coach Mzwandile Stick will take up the same role with the Junior Springboks. Our coaching review was focused on the Springboks and we identified two areas to give Allister Coetzee additional support at the head of our most prized national asset, said SA Rugby president, Mr Mark Alexander. Franco Smith will continue the work he began with the backs and attack at the end of last year while we are very excited about the new defensive coach we have identified to address matters raised during the review. We expect to be able to confirm that appointment shortly. I would like to apologise to our supporters for the delay in this announcement but assure them that it was necessitated not by a lack of clarity of intent but by the need to first resolve all contractual issues. The outcomes we now have were agreed with Allister some weeks ago. Last year was an incredibly tough one for the Springboks and all of the rugby community suffered, said Mr Alexander. We weighed many factors in the review process but we believe that these changes will strengthen the Springbok management hand. The new alignment at both a coaching and conditioning level with the franchises will also provide critical support to the national team. That process continued recently with our third Coaches Indaba and another is already scheduled for later in Vodacom Super Rugby, when the coaches will come together for a third time to discuss our on-field approach. The conditioning coaches are also reconvening on the same day. I d like to thank and commend all the Vodacom Super Rugby coaches once again for buying in to what we want to do and for putting Springbok needs at the forefront of their thinking.
