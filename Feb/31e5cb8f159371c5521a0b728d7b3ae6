The senior cops are accused of taking money and expensive gifts from businessman Saleem Dawjee in exchange for special treatment. CAPE TOWN - Two senior Western Cape police officers implicated in the corruption case of former provincial commissioner Arno Lamoer are facing internal disciplinary action. The pair, along with Lamoer and two others, appeared in the Western Cape High Court on Tuesday morning for a pre-trial hearing. The police officers, some of whom have resigned from the SAPS, are accused of taking money and expensive gifts from businessman Saleem Dawjee in exchange for special treatment. It emerged in court that former Bellville station commander Sharon Govender and Stellenbosch cluster commander Darius van der Ross faced disciplinary hearings last week. They were postponed to next week. Lamoer and Kolindren Govender, who at the time was the provincial head of the inspectorate, have since resigned from the service. Judge Robert Henney made it clear to lawyers that he does not want the disciplinary matter to interfere with the trial which could begin in April. The accused will be back in court next week for another pre-trial hearing.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
