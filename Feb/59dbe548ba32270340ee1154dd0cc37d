Parliament last week announced that the former Eskom CEO had been nominated to become an MP by an ANC branch. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng s West Rand region has slammed what they say is a fake media invitation, supposedly circulated by one of its branches, claiming Brian Molefe as a member. Parliament last week announced that the former Eskom CEO had been nominated to become a Member of Parliament by an ANC branch in the North West province. Questions were raised when alliance partners and the North West leadership said they weren t aware of Molefe s membership and that it was an attempt to propel him into a parliamentary position. Madibeng Municipality Mayor Jostine Mothibe as well as the regional leadership of the ANC in that province on Tuesday held a media briefing in Hartbeespoort to reaffirm their support for Molefe.The executive mayor of the Madibeng Municipality as well as the regional leaders paraded documents showing Molefe s membership papers in Ward 29.The ANC Youth League s Papi Ratele says, We ve tried to be transparent enough to give you the proof that that Brian Molefe is one of our own in this branch. However, a media invite supposedly sent by ANC Ward 32 in the West Rand region claimed it had evidence that Molefe was a member of its branch.This was followed by a swift response by the ANC in the East Rand s Refentse Mangope who said that media invite sent by Ward 32 is fake. It does not come from the branch itself, I think it s some people who just want to tarnish the name of the branch and the ANC leadership. Parliament is yet to set a date to swear Molefe in.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
