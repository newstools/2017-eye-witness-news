JOHANNESBURG - The SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) has confirmed it received a legal opinion in October that it would not be able to make social grant payments effectively itself for a period of several years, because of the complexity of the task.The agency was due to go to the Constitutional Court this week, to ask to be allowed to continue with the current contract with Cash Paymaster Services after judges ruled that contract was illegal.But it appears the agency has still not lodged papers with the court ahead of the contract coming to an end at the end of March.The agency's Kgomoco Diseko says: You don t take and implement one legal advice. There are many stakeholders who are affected by this and want to benefit from this. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
