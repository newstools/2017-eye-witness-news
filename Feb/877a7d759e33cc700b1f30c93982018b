JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma is in Pretoria where he will officially open a refugee reception centre in honour of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. Zuma announced the opening of the centre during his response to the State of the Nation Address (Sona) in Parliament on Thursday. After complaints from foreign nationals about long queues, criminal syndicates and overcrowding the Home Affairs Department has now refurbished the centre. Last year Zuma reported that he had visited the Home Affairs offices in Marabastad and received complaints from foreigners about difficulties at the centre.The president followed through with his promise and has since upgraded the centre. Home Affairs Director General Mkuseli Apleni says there is now a new system in place where refugees need to make an appointment first. What is the point of getting 1,000 people a day whereas we can only service 300. Which means now that 700 is just standing there frustrated. #TutuRefugeeCentre President Jacob Zuma being taken on a walk about by Home Affairs officials including Minister Malusi Gigaba.
