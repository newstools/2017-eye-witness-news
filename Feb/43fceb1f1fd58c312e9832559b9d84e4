CAPE TOWN Economic transformation while accelerating growth are expected to be the key points in Wednesday's Budget Speech.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan will be delivering his address from 2pm.Like Nedbank's Mohammed Nalla, most experts agree Minister Gordhan is faced with a tough balancing act. I think the Finance Minister is definitely walking the tightrope here. What the market is really looking for is consistency. They are looking for delivery on promises that have historically been made. Among them is the promise of radical economic transformation .Earlier this week, Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas said that redistribution must be linked to economic growth.The mid-term budget review says low growth remains the country's biggest obstacle and that it is up to government to implement structural reforms to overcome this.Gordhan is expected to outline measures to spur economic growth to raise the much-needed revenue.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
