JOHANNESBURG - The price of both grades of petrol is set to drop by 8 cents a litre next Wednesday.The energy department says the price of diesel goes down by two cents a litre.Spokesperson Robert Maake says the strengthening of the rand against the US dollar has helped. The following fuel prices will be effective from Wednesday 1 March. Petrol, both grades will decrease by 8 cents, both grades of diesel will decrease by 2 cents per litre and paraffin will drop by 10 cents a litre. The reason for these drops is mainly the strengthening of the rand against the dollar. The Automobile Association (AA) earlier predicted the decrease, saying the oil price is bringing more stability to the cost of fuel.The AA s Layton Beard said, Rand strength and a retreat of international petroleum prices have combined to produce a surprise drop in fuel prices at the end of February. After a bit of a stutter at the beginning of the month, the rand has continued to firm against the US dollar throughout the month. At the same time, international oil prices have come off their mind-month highs and are now testing their lowest levels yet for 2017.
