Sassa was supposed to go to the ConCourt to ask for an extension for its contract to make sure millions of people get their grants in March. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says it s deeply concerned about the manner in which the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) is handling the extension of its contract with Cash Paymaster Services.Sassa was supposed to go to the Constitutional Court to ask for an extension for its current contract to make sure millions of people who rely on the grant get their money in March.The contract is coming to an end on 31 March.Sassa says it was not ready to submit a report to court on Wednesday and will only do so next week.Cosatu s Sizwe Pamla says it seems if the state has no urgency to deal with social grants. For us, this points to the core of what Cosatu has been saying. Anytime you start to put into place attempts to outsource the mandate of the state, you risk this kind of scenario. We re really angered that we ve heard very little from the Minister of Social Development.
