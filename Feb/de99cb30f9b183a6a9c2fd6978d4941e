Parliament had adopted the Fica Act to comply with the standards issued by the task force, but President Jacob Zuma referred the bill back to Parliament. JOHANNESBURG The National Treasury says the International Financial Action Task Force has decided not to issue a public statement on South Africa s failure to fully comply with international standards against money laundering and terrorist financing.Parliament had adopted the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) Act to comply with the standards issued by the task force, but President Jacob Zuma referred the bill back to Parliament following an objection by Mzwanele Manyi.The Treasury says the Financial Action Task Force met in Paris last week and has decided to defer making a public statement about South Africa s failure to comply with its standards until June.Officials say the meeting was told that the delay in signing the bill was due to concerns around whether it was constitutional.They also told the panel that the delay does not reflect a lack of political commitment to address the deficiencies.Two weeks ago, Parliament's finance committee said it had clarified President Zuma's concerns, and sent the bill back to Parliament with only minor changes.LISTEN: Organisations raise concerns about FICA Bill(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
