A top court ordered government to revoke the notice of intention to withdraw from the ICC on the basis that it was unconstitutional &amp; invalid. PRETORIA - As government deliberates on a damning court finding around another unconstitutional decision, this time related to the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ruling has been welcomed by some political parties as a victory for the rule of law. The High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday ordered government to revoke the notice of intention to withdraw from the ICC on the basis that it was unconstitutional and invalid.Government made the decision after an earlier ruling found it had acted unlawfully, by failing to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he was in South Africa.Congress of the People (Cope) s Dennis Bloem says the party is grateful to the courts for upholding the rule of law. Cope warned this government that it cannot bypass elements and neither the president (Jacob Zuma) nor the executives have the right to take such a decision. The Democratic Alliance s James Selfe says they find the government s position inexplicable. That a political party that was at the forefront of fighting for human rights should find itself now in a situation where it defends people who ve been charged with gross human rights violations. Minister Michael Masutha says the judgment is being studied but he s made it clear that South Africa still intends to withdraw from the ICC. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
