On Tuesday morning Mashaba released a statement detailing the changes.&quot;I have sat down with MMC Still and discussed the matter extensively. Unfortunately, we held a difference of opinion on the approach to tackling matters of investigations into alleged fraud and corruption within City Power.&quot;I am firmly of the view that I require a team of MMCs who share my commitment to tackling matters of alleged fraud and corruption in the City. This is what the residents of our City have demanded and I will remain unapologetic in my commitment to deliver on it.&quot;Mashaba says that De Jager has served as a councillor in the city since 2005.&quot;MMC De Jager has the tenacity to address the serious issues that plague the delivery of services from the City Entities that operate under this Department. I regard this to be the most important aspect of any candidate for this position. The change that has been required by the voters of Johannesburg requires this kind of tenacity, to which I refer, to deliver it.&quot;I have every confidence in newly appointed MMC De Jager &amp; I wish him well in this new role.
