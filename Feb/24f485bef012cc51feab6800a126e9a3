Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans say the intention of their resolution is not to undermine the processes of the ANC. JOHANNESBURG - Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans say their call to have the African National Congress (ANC)'s National Executive Committee (NEC) disbanded during the national consultative conference is in the best interests of members and branches. On Wednesday the MK steering committee gave feedback on resolutions taken during their council meeting with former soldiers and their sit down with the ANC s top six on Monday.Last December MKMVA leader Kebby Maphatswe called on Umkhonto we Sizwe members not to attend the convention. Secretary general Gwede Mantashe also dismissed the gathering, saying it fell outside the structures of the ruling party.Former SANDF general Siphiwe Nyanda says the intention of their resolution is not to undermine the processes of the ANC. It s not that we think the leadership of the ANC is not duly constituted, it is duly constituted, but we thought because of the challenges, especially arising out of the last election where significant support was lost. The MK veterans have also called for ANC branches to be disbanded and re-launched where necessary as a part of the review of the ruling party s constitution.This includes concerns raised about the membership clause which speaks to how people can become members of the ANC and the buying of branches.The veterans say they also plan to meet with cadres in provinces ahead of the ANC s consultative conference later this year.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
