The lekgotla is expected to set the stage for President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s State of the Nation Address next week. JOHANNESBURG - Government says President Jacob Zuma, Cabinet ministers and provincial premiers will focus on radical socio-economic transformation as they start their annual policy lekgotla on Wednesday.The lekgotla is expected to set the stage for Zuma s State of the Nation Address next week.Two weeks ago, it was reported that President Zuma had told an African National Congress (ANC) meeting the party needed to stop being so apologetic about economic transformation.Now government says that radical socio-economic transformation will be the focus of this lekgotla.But political analyst Professor Mcebisi Ndletyana says the ANC said this before. There is some reason to be somewhat pessimistic because we ve had this before. But there might be a possibility of something new because the contexts have changed. He says Zuma may be trying to cast himself as radical president to start a project Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma could finish.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
