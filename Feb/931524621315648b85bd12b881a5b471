Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas first described the meeting with the Guptas last year and then described it in detail in the Public Protector's report on state capture. JOHANNESBURG The Gupta family's lawyer says Ajay Gupta is sticking to his claim that Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas is blatantly dishonest for claiming they met in Saxonwold and that Gupta offered him the position of Finance Minister and R600 million.On Thursday, Jonas lodged court papers saying Gupta was lying when he said the meeting never happened, this as part of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's application asking a court to rule that he cannot force the banks to keep the Gupta's accounts open.Jonas first described the meeting last year, and then described it in detail in the Public Protector's report on state capture.The controversial family s attorney, Gert van der Merwe, says it's his instruction that Ajay Gupta still believes Jonas is blatantly dishonest.But he has provided an explanation as to why this meeting would have happened with Duduzane Zuma and Fana Hlongwane at the Gupta's home in Saxondwold. Van der Merwe also says earlier affidavits signed by Zuma and Hlongwane, saying that the meeting happened in October 2017 are obviously a mistake.He says he believes the only way to get to the bottom of what may have happened at this meeting is for an appropriate forum to make a finding.WATCH: Ajay Gupta - The interview that never happened(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
