The SACP&#8217;s central committee says the &#8216;Gupta-captured network&#8217; has been more aggressive &amp; reckless since President Zuma's second term. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) s central committee says President Jacob Zuma's second administration has been marked by recklessness and interventions by the Gupta-captured network, which is conducting itself as a shadowy parallel state. It's made the comments in the online edition of the African Communist Magazine. The SACP has been highly critical of the Gupta family, calling on President Zuma to distance himself from them for his own good.In the article, the SACP's central committee says what it calls the Gupta-captured network has been more aggressive and reckless since President Zuma's second term started in 2014.The party's Alex Mashilo also says they came to this conclusion as a collective. This network often conducts itself as a shadowy parallel state outside of the collective Cabinet discipline and above any accountability to Parliament or the African National Congress. The party also says that the growing recklessness of this parasitic tendency has opened up a chance for a recalibrated relationship between the left and the Treasury, particularly after the firing of Nhlanhla Nene as Finance Minister and the attacks on the South African Revenue Service.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
