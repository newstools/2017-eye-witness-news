The DA has raised concern that Muthambi had told the inquiry she submitted the SABC&#8217;s Memorandum of Incorporation when that was not the case. CAPE TOWN - Parliamentarians have questioned the reliability of Communications Minister Faith Muthambi s evidence before an inquiry into the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board.The ad hoc committee is deliberating its interim report after receiving responses to it.Members of Parliament (MPs) will also begin discussing recommendations before finalising the document. MPs had been going swiftly through the interim report, before getting stuck on the SABC s Memorandum of Incorporation (MoI) signed by Muthambi.The Democratic Alliance s Mike Waters raised concern that Muthambi had told the inquiry she submitted the MoI when that was not the case. The fact that there s so many inconsistencies in the minister s testimony before the committee shows that she actually is an unreliable witness. African National Congress MP Juli Kilian said the issue has to be reviewed in parliamentary transcripts. She stated that she submitted it and evidence shows that no such document was in fact lodged. The ad hoc committee eventually agreed after consultation with legal advisors that the MoI is invalid because documentation was never properly filed.
