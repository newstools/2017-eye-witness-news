Fikile Mbalula says cost challenges may mean Durban could lose out on hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games. CAPE TOWN - South Africa's Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula said on Tuesday Durban may lose out on hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games due to cost challenges.In December South Africa's officials said it remained &quot;fully committed&quot; to hosting the games despite falling short of requirements.Durban was the only city with a confirmed bid after Edmonton in Canada withdrew in February citing falling oil prices.&quot;I don't want to raise your expectations and say everything looks good, it doesn't because we don't agree on the fundamentals and that is the operational budget,&quot; Mbalula told a media briefing.South Africa was forced to reconsider whether it could host the event due to doubts over the economic legacy of the Games and sluggish growth. The government estimated that the Games could deliver up to R20 billion in output to the economy.&quot;We gave it our best shot but we can't go beyond, if the country says we don't have this money, we can't really,&quot; Mbalula said, adding that a final decision would be made soon by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF).The Commonwealth Games, first staged in 1930, are a multi-sport event held every four years featuring athletes from over 50 countries, mostly former British colonies.The 2022 Games could be the first time they have been held in Africa, possibly setting up the chance for South Africa to make another bid for the Olympics after Cape Town finished third in the race for the 2004 summer Games.The games federation is due to meet in London next week to decide Durban's fate.In November South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) president Gideon Sam said the sports confederation had made the necessary corrections to their Durban 2022 Commonwealth Games preparations that were required of them by the CGF.This came after Durban failed to meet the criteria set out by the CGF regarding funding guarantees from government, the establishment of a local organising committee, athletes venues and respective technical issues, among other things.The city, as well as Sascoc and the Department of Sport and Recreation, received an extended deadline to 30 November 2016 to implement the remedial action and resubmit their bid book to the CGF.Sam said that they had done all they could to adhere to every condition set out by the CGF and they were confident that they would get the green light to go ahead and host.
