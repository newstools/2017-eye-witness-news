HARARE - A high court judge in Zimbabwe has on Wednesday afternoon granted bail to detained protest pastor Evan Mawarire, who s been charged with subverting the government. The judge said the State s case against the founder of the #ThisFlag movement was weak. This ruling is being celebrated on social media in Zimbabwe.High Court Judge Clement Phiri, who s previously ruled against Grace Mugabe, said Mawarire was a good candidate for bail as he was not likely to abscond. He ordered Mawarire to pay US$300 in bail money, surrender his passport and report twice a week to his local police station. The #ThisFlag founder has already spent a week in custody, part of it at Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison. Defence lawyers say Mawarire is likely to only be released on Thursday after the paperwork is done.
