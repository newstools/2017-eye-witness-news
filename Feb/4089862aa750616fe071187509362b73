Charles de Wet says while a flat tax has been in discussion, it has not gained much traction over the years and is not in line with international trends. JOHANNESBURG Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is expected to deliver the National Budget Speech in Parliament on Wednesday.Listeners on Talk Radio 702 were invited to give their view on how best the Finance Minister can tweak the budget to ensure South Africa s economy thrives.One caller suggests the scrapping of personal income tax to be replaced by increased value added taxes (VAT) to an estimated 21% while keeping the bread basket items at a controlled rate to cover lower income households and lowering company taxes. All this will lead to disposable income and in effect generate more tax, as South Africans tend to spend what they have. Tax expert, Charles de Wet says while a flat tax has been on the agenda for many years, the discussion has not gained much traction and it is not in line with international trends. I think what we have seen around the world is a move towards more indirect taxes and less direct taxes. What is good about those, is that you get to spend what you spend your money on and how much taxes you pay. De Wet added while this is an option, it is important to consider some exemption or funding for those who can t afford basic food stuffs. He says the country has high incidence of individual tax and it would be difficult to change this. While one percentage point in VAT raises nearly R20 billion, to replace personal income tax it would have to be raised from 14% by an additional 15 to 20 basis points.European VAT sits at a rate between 17% and 20% on top of punitive personal income taxes. Many of those countries increased the VAT due to the introduction of austerity measures in 2008 and have subsequently reduced the rate. De Wet says while the country s VAT is lower than that of Europe, it would be difficult to increase it by another 20 basis point on top the current 14%.
