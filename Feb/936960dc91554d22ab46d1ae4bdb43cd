It is unacceptable that people are still not adhering to water restrictions. This is unlawful. This abuse of water means that we will all suffer. In terms of naming water abusers, the city will only publish the identities of residents or commercial properties once they have paid a fine or once they have appeared in court in connection with their transgression of Level 3B restrictions. The mayor also thanked residents for their water saving efforts. During my visit to Pinelands last week, and driving through various areas in Cape Town, I have noticed many dry gardens and this tells me that most residents are working with us to save water. She added that some in the commercial sector have been committed to reducing water consumption.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
