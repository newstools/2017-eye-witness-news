President Jacob Zuma visited Block L, which he singled out in his Sona, as requiring special attention due to the high crime rate. JOHANNESBURG President Jacob Zuma says he is visiting crime affected communities and police stations across the country to come up with a strategy to address the scourge. Zuma made the comments outside the Rietgat police station in Soshanguve on Tuesday afternoon. The President visited Block L, which he singled out in his State of the Nation Address, as requiring special attention due to the high crime rate in the area. President Zuma says crime is a major problem facing South Africans. I am trying to find ways and means of dealing with crime. In no way can we sit in South Africa and live side-by-side with crime. As part of his outreach efforts, Zuma says he also met with a group of drug addicts. Those who want to come out of drugs, we are going to meet so as to plan with them how we are going to get them out of the problem. Zuma says the justice and crime prevention cluster will soon be meeting to assess the approach to combatting crime.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
