Opposition parties say the ANC doesn't care about public opinion and rewards its affiliates who're not suitable for public office. CAPE TOWN Opposition parties have criticised the African National Congress (ANC), after it confirmed that former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe has been nominated to fill a post on the North West list of ANC Members in Parliament.Molefe resigned from Eskom last year, after he was implicated in the Public Protector's State of Capture report.He was found to have regularly communicated with one of the Gupta brothers, amid speculation that Eskom had irregularly awarded a Gupta-owned company, a coal supply tender. Parliamentary spokesperson Molotho Mothapo says presiding officers have yet to determine when the former Eskom CEO will be sworn in as an MP. At an appropriate time presiding officers will have him sworn in. The Democratic Alliance's parliamentary chief whip John Steenhuisen says the appointment is shocking. It shows that the ANC doesn t take corruption and maladministration seriously. Congress of the People leader Mosioua Lekota shares these sentiments.Opposition parties believe the ANC does not care about public opinion, and rewards its affiliates who're not suitable for public office.
