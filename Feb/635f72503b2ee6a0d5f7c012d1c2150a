Twenty-nine members of the Gauteng provincial legislature voted in favour of Premier David Makhura&#8217;s removal, while 37 voted against the motion. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng has accused the opposition of using the Life Esidimeni tragedy for cheap politicking.Provincial legislature members debated a motion of no confidence in Premier David Makhura earlier on Tuesday.Twenty-nine members voted in favour of Makhura s removal, while 37 voted against the motion.ANC chief whip Brian Hlongwa says the opposition knew they'd fail due to the numbers, but he believes they went ahead away for the sake of political scoring. They issued a very disturbing statement, to the media, to the effect that whilst they could not win this motion it would present them with an opportunity for interviews and photographs. We think that s a new low. However, the Democratic Alliances Jack Bloom says the party has remained consistent on the matter. I think the ANC is just trying to avoid the issue. The fact is that we want to hold them to account and accountability requires honesty. The Inkatha Freedom Party declined to vote on the motion.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
