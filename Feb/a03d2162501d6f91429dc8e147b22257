National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete says that the wrong impression has been created about the deployment of members of SANDF to Sona. PARLIAMENT - National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete says that the wrong impression has been created over the deployment of members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to the State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday.There's been criticism from opposition parties and some civil society groups since President Jacob Zuma announced on Tuesday that about 441 members of the SANDF will be helping to maintain law and order during the address.Mbete says none of the SANDF members will be deployed at in the parliamentary precinct or in the chamber. We re not going to see members of SANDF milling around precinct of Parliament.&quot;We are not going to see many, or 100s of defence force members in Parliament. No, those members will not be around Parliament, they will simply be where they ought to be, as soldiers.&quot;Mbete also gave assurances that journalists would not be hindered in doing their jobs on Thursday.&quot;All of us gather here and we each play our roles in the usual way. It s not in fact in the interests of Parliament for journalists to feel they re accosted or stopped from moving around in the usual manner.&quot;The Presidency says there is nothing unusual about deploying soldiers as it has been done in the past.#SONA2017 Mbete asked if they were aware of Pres&#39;s decision to deploy troops for &quot;law &amp; order&quot;; if she is paying for #SpeakersBall GDNational Council of Provinces chairperson Thandi Modise acknowledged that the number of soldiers being deployed has grown but says Parliament cannot give a reason why this is the case.In 2013, there were 168 soldiers deployed, in 2015 there were 188. On Thursday there ll be two-and-a-half times as many on duty 441.Asked why the numbers had grown so dramatically, NCOP chairperson Thandi Modise responded by saying: The fact that this year this is 441, Parliament cannot explain the difference between why they chose in 2013 to deploy 168 and now 441. Earlier on (today), in our meeting with the chief whips of different parties, we undertook to find out why the numbers have grown, because we ourselves cannot explain. The chief whips of the DA, the EFF and the NFP met with Mbete and Modise earlier this afternoon after the DA requested an urgent meeting to discuss the SANDF deployment.DA chief whip John Steenhuisen says they were told none of the soldiers would be used within the Parliamentary precinct. The Speaker and the chairperson gave the undertaking there would be no deployment of the SANDF on the precinct of Parliament but it doesn t take away the fact that they are being deployed in an ever-expanded red zone outside of Parliament, driving people away, keeping the people away from their Parliament.
