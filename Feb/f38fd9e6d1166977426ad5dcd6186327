It&#8217;s unclear when National Student Financial Aid Scheme will approve funding for the students. CAPE TOWN - More than 1,000 Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) students could lose their accommodation on campus if financial aid support is delayed.Some students have been camped out in TV rooms and halls as they await approval from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS).There've been similar reports at the Walter Sisulu University where students have staged protests because they are unable to register.More than half of the 3,200 beds at NMMU s Port Elizabeth and George campuses have already been taken by registered students. The institution says the remaining 1,084 rooms have been reserved for those waiting for NSFAS approval.If the students are not registered by Monday or have made arrangements with the residence managers, the rooms will be given to others desperately looking for accommodation. It s unclear when NSFAS will approve funding for the students.Meanwhile, the financial aid scheme says it has already provided financial support to nearly 300,000 students for the upcoming academic year.(Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
