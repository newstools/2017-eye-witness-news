O&#8217;Sullivan was released last night, barely six hours after he was arrested outside his attorney&#8217;s offices in Centurion. PRETORIA - Private investigator Paul O Sullivan says the police officer responsible for his arrest has also previously carried out questionable, high-profile investigations and has been described as the police s go-to man. The High Court in Pretoria ordered O Sullivan s immediate release from detention on Monday night, barely six hours after he was arrested outside his attorney s offices in Centurion. The private investigator is accused of impersonating an official from the Independent Police Investigate Directorate, a claim first raised by Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. The lieutenant-general has been highly critical of O Sullivan for allegedly involving himself in an Ipid corruption investigation. O Sullivan says Major-General Ntebo Jan Mabula from the North West province has been assigned to investigate the allegations made by Phahlane. Coincidentally it s the same person who arrested Gerrie Nel in the Jacki Selebi trial and the same person who arrested major-general Johan Booysen. So he is obviously a go-to guy for these sorts of issues. It emerged in court on Monday night that the arresting officers were shown a court order which compels the police to give O Sullivan 48 hours notice to present himself at a police station if he is to be arrested. Despite this, the police ignored the court order saying they disagreed with its interpretation, an argument dismissed by Judge Francis Legodi. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
