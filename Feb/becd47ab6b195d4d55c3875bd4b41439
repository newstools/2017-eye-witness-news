Krejcir &amp; two of his co-accused refused to enter pleas on Thursday so the court was forced to do so on their behalf. JOHANNESBURG The state has confirmed it s in talks with the alleged middleman in the Sam Issa murder, indicating he s set to turn state witness against Czech Radovan Krejcir and his co-accused. Prosecutors on Thursday dropped charges against Bulgarian Boris Grigorov while Krejcir and the others pleaded not guilty. Issa was gunned down in Bedfordview in 2013. The state did not give reasons for why charges were withdrawn against Grigorov but have confirmed he is in talks with the state and is likely to become a section 204 witness, receiving indemnity from prosecution for his evidence. Krejcir and two of his co-accused refused to enter pleas on Thursday, so the court was forced to do so on their behalf. One of the accused Nkanyiso Mafunda provided a statement to the court in which he says he does not know why he is being charged because an eyewitness apparently saw the hand of a white man holding the gun used to shoot Issa. The state alleges Krejcir hired the hit men through Grigorov and orchestrated the killing of Issa because he owed him half a million rand that he borrowed to pay for bail in another case.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
