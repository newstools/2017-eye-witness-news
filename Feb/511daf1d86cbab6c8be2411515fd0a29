JOHANNESBURG - The Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) says it s pleased that the remains of at least fourteen of the party s military wing members have been exhumed and handed over to their families.A total of 130 political prisoners were hanged between 1960 and 1990 by the apartheid government, at the then Pretoria Maximum Prison, now Kgo i Mampuru Correctional Centre.They were all buried in unmarked graves in the capital and at least 83 of them have been exhumed since December last year.PAC General Secretary Narius Moloto says the blood of those heroes has nourished the democracy South Africans are enjoying today.Moloto says their members will be given dignified burials. As a national today we talk of freedom and democratic but pay less attention to the people who fought for it. The families and PAC never had an opportunity to enter the prison, the exhumation marks their release from prison. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
