Man United, who beat St Etienne on Wednesday, face playing the 2nd leg of their next Europa League tie just 3 days after their FA Cup showdown against Chelsea. BENGALURU - Jose Mourinho's delight at Manchester United's progress to the last 16 of the Europa League has been tempered by the timing of their FA Cup quarter-final against Chelsea, with the manager criticising the tie being scheduled for a Monday.United, who beat St Etienne 1-0 on Wednesday to progress 4-0 on aggregate, now face the prospect of playing the second leg of their next Europa League tie just three days after their FA Cup showdown against former club Chelsea on March 13.&quot;I feel really surprised that the decision is made before our draw in Europe because nobody knows who we play against, nor where the first and second matches are being played,&quot; Mourinho told reporters ahead of Friday's Europa League draw.&quot;We play Chelsea on Monday then we've got a second match in Europe, Russia or Turkey. This is what we have.&quot;The Portuguese also criticised local rivals Manchester City, who fielded a weakened team in the FA Cup last season when faced with a similar problem under former manager Manuel Pellegrini.Chelsea duly ran out 5-1 winners against Pellegrini's second-string selection, and Mourinho said he would not disrespect the competition by packing his side with youngsters.&quot;I cannot play against Chelsea with the second team,&quot; Mourinho added. &quot;I cannot play against Chelsea with the under-21s, like Manchester City did - was it last year? We're Manchester United. I cannot do that. I don't do that.&quot;As United manager, I don't do that to the FA Cup because the FA Cup is not guilty of these decisions. The cup is beautiful, the competition is historical and I have to treat United supporters and the FA Cup in the right way.&quot;What is going to happen is an accumulation of matches, people playing lots of matches. I will have to make some rotation but some of the boys will have to play all consecutive matches.&quot;United, who have won the FA Cup 12 times, play Southampton in the League Cup final on Sunday, looking for their fifth win in the competition.
