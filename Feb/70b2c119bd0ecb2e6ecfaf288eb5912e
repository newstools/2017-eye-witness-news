The National Prosecuting Authority says there is a need for unbiased prosecutions when it comes to racism on social media. JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has told the South African Human Rights Commission that once the hate speech bill is promulgated, it will still be challenging to prosecute social media users who spread hate speech.The commission is holding a two-day hearing at its Braamfontein offices on racism and social media.The Nelson Mandela, Ahmed Kathrada and FW de Klerk foundations will present their views on the matter.The NPA s Sibongile Mzinyathi says there is a need for unbiased prosecutions when it comes to racism on social media.He says the proposed hate speech and hate crimes bill is needed, but will prove difficult for the NPA due to the anonymity of social media users.&quot;Our concern is that there are so many areas which the act will criminalise and we're concerned about the volumes of work.&quot;Mzinyathi adds those who retweet and share hate speech on social media could also face investigation and prosecution even if the original message was not created by them.Panelists include chairperson Bongani Majola, commissioner Angie Makwetla and former Constitutional Court Justice Albie Sachs.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
