CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has expressed concern over hoax messages surfacing on social media warning of impending water cuts.Earlier this week, a false alert did the rounds on Facebook and WhatsApp, warning people the city would cut off water later this month.The message also referred to phase 4 water restrictions.The city's Priya Reddy says this is just one of many hoax alerts the municipality is aware of. This is not authentic City of Cape Town communication. The instigators of this hoax in one version made reference to 29 and 30 February 2017, but these days do not exist. It must be noted that we regard such cases on social media in the same manner we view prank phone calls. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
