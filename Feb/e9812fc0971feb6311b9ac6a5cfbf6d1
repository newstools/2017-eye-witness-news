Hulme Scholes &amp; his firm are going to court claiming the current law is too vague &amp; gives too much discretion to govt officials. JOHANNESBURG The High Court in Pretoria will on Tuesday morning start hearing an application from a law firm which claims that the entire Mining Charter is illegal and unconstitutional, and should be scrapped.Mining attorney Hulme Scholes and his firm Malan Scholes are going to court claiming the current law is too vague and gives too much discretion to government officials.The Chamber of Mines is also involved in a dispute with the Mineral Resources Department over the question of whether a mining company is still considered to comply with BEE legislation if the shares given to black investors are then sold to white people.It s understood that Scholes and his law firm are basing their case on the claim that the current Mining Charter legislation does not comply with the Constitution.They are also expected to argue that the current law is actually a framework that has been elevated to legislation.But one of their main objections to the current law is that there is too much discretion in the hands of officials and thus mining companies may not be able to determine how to actually comply with the law.On Monday, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane said a new Mining Charter will be finalised in March, despite claims from the Chamber of Mines that he has not consulted with mining companies.Zwane is opposing Tuesday's application while the National Empowerment Fund and the Centre for Applied Legal Studies are acting as friends of the court.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
