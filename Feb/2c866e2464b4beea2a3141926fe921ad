The state-owned airline has been ordered to pay Comair R554 million plus interest at 15.5% for anti-competitive behaviour. JOHANNESBURG South African Airways (SAA) says it s considering whether to appeal a high court ruling ordering it to pay Comair over R1 billion for anti-competitive behaviour.The judgment, handed down on Wednesday, comes after a 14-year legal battle between the two airlines.Comair accused SAA of implementing an incentive scheme to travel agents which kept them loyal to the state-owned airline to the exclusion of its competitors and in violation of the Competition Act.The High Court in Johannesburg found that SAA had agreements with travel agents from 2001 when it paid them to divert customers.The state-owned airline now has to pay Comair R554 million plus interest at 15.5% for their conduct.SAA spokesperson Tladi Tladi says they have noted the judgment. We re studying the judgment to see whether there are grounds for an appeal and for the airline to decide whether it will effect such a decision if the grounds for an appeal exist. The state-owned airline says it s important to note that the legal matter dates back to the period of 1999 to 2005 and was implemented by the then management team.It says new business management processes have since been introduced to ensure compliance with the relevant prescripts.Comair says it needs time to study the ruling as it was a complex and long matter.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
