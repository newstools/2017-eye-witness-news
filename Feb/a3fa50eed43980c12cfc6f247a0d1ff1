Afridi&#8217;s last match for Pakistan was the defeat by Australia in the World Twenty20 in Mohali in March 2016. LONDON Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi has announced his retirement from international cricket, but said he wants to play in his country s domestic league for two more years.The flamboyant allrounder, who played the last of his 27 tests in 2010 and retired from one-day internationals in 2015, quit as Pakistan s 20-overs captain after the team s poor World Twenty20 campaign in India last year. I have said goodbye to international cricket, Afridi, who turns 37 next month, said in Sharjah after smashing a 28-ball 54 for Peshawar Zalmi against Karachi Kings in the ongoing Pakistan Super League. I am playing for my fans and will continue to play this league for another two years but it s goodbye from international cricket. Now my foundation is important for me. I have played with seriousness and in a professional way for my country. Known for his swashbuckling batting and tricky leg-spin, Afridi s last match for Pakistan was the defeat by Australia in the World Twenty20 in Mohali in March 2016.Despite his intention to continue in the game s shortest format, he has not been selected since that defeat.
