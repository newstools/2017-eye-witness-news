Former South African President Thabo Mbeki says that attacking migrants will never solve challenges facing the country. PRETORIA - Newly elected Unisa chancellor Thabo Mbeki has raised grave concerns over recent xenophobic attacks, warning that none of the country s problems will be solved by attacking immigrants. Last week violence erupted in Tshwane during an anti-immigrant march, where foreign-owned shops were looted and police had to intervene.Mbeki was inaugurated this afternoon at Unisa s main campus in Pretoria.He says he is concerned about the events that took place last week. As South Africans, we should never forget the enormous sacrifices that were made by thepeople of Africa to help us achieve our liberation. We cannot now behave in a manner that treats other Africans, who are no residents in our country, as enemies or unwelcomed guests. Mbeki says attacking migrants will never solve challenges facing the country. Many of us know that our country faces many socio-economic challenges such as poverty and unemployment. Not even one of these problems can or will be solved by attacking fellow Africans who have joined us as migrants. He has urged police to investigate criminal activities reported to them by communities.WATCH: Violence mars xenophobic march in Pretoria (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
