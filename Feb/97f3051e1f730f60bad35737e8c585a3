President Zuma vowed that government will use regulatory measures to influence the behaviour of the private sector to drive transformation. CAPE TOWN - While some experts have labelled it as populist policies, others have welcomed President Jacob Zuma s emphasis on radical socio-economic transformation.In his State of the Nation Address last week, Zuma vowed that government will use regulatory measures to influence the behaviour of the private sector to drive transformation.Political analyst Daniel Silke says credit ratings agencies will also follow the implementation of these transformative policies. If we become too maverick in our style of policy adaptation on economic transformation, then I think rating agencies will judge us quite negatively on this issue. We ve seen a lot of rhetoric on theissue, it is populist and it appeals to Zuma s support base. Following last year s local elections, Fitch warned the ruling party of the risks should it use populist policies to win back voters which could mean costly spending measures or even regulations which could hamper growth.But analyst Zamikhaya Maseti disagrees with Silke. I don t think when we talk about radical socio-economic transformation we re being populist. The fact of the matter is that we have a democratic state which has to intervene in the economy and intervene on behalf of the poor. Both experts agree that the credit ratings agencies are likely to give more weight to next week s budget speech.WATCH: #Sona2017 President Zuma actually spoke Christa Eybers | President Jacob Zuma delivered his State of the Nation Address, concentrating on the economy, wage talks, Eskom & the national minimum wage, saying that there needs to be radical, social & economic transformation.
