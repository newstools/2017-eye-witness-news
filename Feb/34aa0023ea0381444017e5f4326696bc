The EFF had alleged that NPA head Shaun Abrahams was neither competent nor fit and proper to be an advocate. JOHANNESBURG - The General Council of the Bar (GCB) has dismissed the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)'s bid to have National Prosecution Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams struck from the roll of advocates. The EFF had lodged a complaint with the GCB over Abrahams attending a meeting at the African National Congress (ANC)'s offices just a day before announcing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan would be charged. The GCB has dismissed a complaint laid by the EFF to investigate the conduct of Abrahams and have his name struck from the roll of advocates. The bar concluded that it could find no allegation of dishonesty or character defect against Abrahams and that there is simply no prima facie case for the application. The EFF had alleged that Abrahams had violated his constitutional and ethical duties and that he was neither competent nor fit and proper to be an advocate. The NPA has welcomed the GCB's decision.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
