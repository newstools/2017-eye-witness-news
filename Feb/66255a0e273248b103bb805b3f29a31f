The Ipid head has assured Parliament of the body&#8217;s independence &amp; made it clear Paul O'Sullivan has not been hired. PRETORIA Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride has assured the police portfolio committee of the body s independence and made it clear that private investigator Paul O'Sullivan has not been hired or tasked with investigating acting National Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane. McBride made the comments during a briefing on high-profile cases in Parliament on Wednesday where he addressed concerns related to the private investigator s role in the case.Phahlane is the subject of a corruption investigation where it s alleged he took kick-backs from police service providers in exchange for tenders, an allegation he has strongly denied. The lieutenant-general has publicly stated his displeasure with O'Sullivan s role in the matter and has launched a court application to prohibit his further involvement. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman asked McBride about Ipid s operating procedures and independence with clear reference to O'Sullivan s alleged involvement in the case against Phahlane. The issue of possible involvement of other parties, third parties or consultants may effect, from a perception point of view, investigations. While McBride made it clear that O'Sullivan is the complainant in the matter, senior investigator Matthews Sesoko provided a legal perspective. It is not peculiar only to Ipid. Even the police do that. When you have a complainant that has information regarding a crime, there is nothing in law that bars you from using your complainant to obtain that information. The committee asked Ipid to file several reports related to high-profile matters.(Edited by Tamsin Wort)
