This matter is deeply painful for the country and should not be used for political gains. DA leader Mmusi Maimane says a commission of inquiry is necessary to investigate matters that have come to light since the completion of the Health Ombudsman's report. According to email chain Minister Motsoaledi knew about the plan to move the patients as early as March 2016 and seemingly failed to intervene. The DA says the Esidimeni victims deserve the same justice as those who died at Marikana.
