EWN looks at some of the Health Ombud's Life Esidimeni report findings, which led to the resignation of Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu. JOHANNESBURG - Dozens of mentally ill patients died after being transferred from Life Esidimeni facilities into the care of non-governmental organisations across Gauteng, without their families being notified in many instances.In October 2015 Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu announced that her department's contract with Life Esidimeni - a Life Healthcare group subsidiary - was being terminated. This was done to save money and was in line with government policy to 'deinstitutionalise' certain patients. The patients were moved to community care NGOs in June 2016.After the deaths of 36 former Life Esidimeni patients emerged, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi ordered that the Office of the Health Ombud investigate the matter.On 1 February 2017, the Health Ombud - Professor Malegapuru Makgoba - made his final report public and less than three hours later Gauteng Premier David Makhura announced that Mahlangu had resigned the night before.The Health Ombud made a number of shocking findings, including the ten listed below:1) The first finding to shock the public was that 94 had died between March and December 2016, not 34 as was initially reported. All 94 patients died under &quot;unlawful circumstances&quot;.2) The Ombud also found that none of the 27 community care NGOs the patients were sent to had valid licences.3) The Gauteng Directorate of Mental Health could only confirm the deaths of 48 patients, indicating &quot;an institution with poor data integrity (lack of accuracy and lack of consistency) and the lack of reliable and quality information systems found during the investigation.&quot;4) 8 this was the number of requests the Ombud made to the Gauteng Health Department for information before the department responded. 5) The Ombud has established that there is prima facie evidence showing that a number of department officials and NGOs violated the Constitution and contravened the National Health Act and the Mental Health Act. The office also found that there were consistent human rights violations.6) Makgoba recommends that Makhura &quot;consider the suitability of MEC Qedani Dorothy Mahlangu to continue in her current role as MEC for Health&quot;. He also recommends that the Gauteng Mental Health Marathon Project &quot;cease to exist&quot;.7) The investigation found that the transfer of patients was rushed, the patients' families weren't given sufficient notification and that some of the patients were not treated with dignity during and after the transferrals.8) Despite objections from external professionals and staff in her department, Mahlangu forged ahead with the transferral project.9) The plan to transfer patients from Life Esidimeni was never shared with &quot;several senior officials,&quot; including some in the national Health Department.10) In conclusion, the Ombud found the decision taken by the Gauteng Health Department &quot;to terminate and relocate patients from LE Centres precipitously was fundamentally flawed, irrational, unwise and inhumane&quot;.READ the full report below: The report into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of mentally ill patients: Gauteng province by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd
