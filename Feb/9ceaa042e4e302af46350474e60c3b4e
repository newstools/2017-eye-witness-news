JOHANNESBURG The Kruger National Park has evacuated two camps and closed gravel roads inside the park as a precautionary measure to prepare for tropical storm Dineo.The storm has killed seven people in Mozambique and already displaced 130,000 people.It s now made landfall in South Africa, in parts of Mpumalanga and Limpopo.South African National Parks (SANParks) spokesperson William Mabasa says they re monitoring the situation. We have been having rain since yesterday, nice soft rain which we really needed, up until this morning. We did however as a precautionary measure close all the gravel roads in order to make sure people are safe. Weather Service forecaster Puseletso Mofokeng says in KwaZulu-Natal the rain is as severe as was expected. The wind speeds are still very much strong we have an average of about 50 kilometres per hour, gusting to about 65 kilometres per hour, but here in Gauteng we have about 30 kilometres per hour generally, but it will gust at about 40 kilometres per hour. POSSIBLE FLOODINGThe Weather Service says possible flooding can be expected in parts of Limpopo as the Limpopo river has already started to swell as a result of the storm.Forecasters predict heavy rainfall will continue well into the weekend.Forecaster Wayne Venter says, She is going to move along the Limpopo river and with the rainfall especially in the southern parts of Zimbabwe and Botswana, that still has to go through into the Limpopo river, so we still have all that water coming through so that s probably going to push the river levels quite high. Meanwhile doctor Mmaphaka Tau is leading the national disaster management centre says affected departments will meet on Friday morning to discuss the impact of the storm on the country.(Edited by Neo Koza)
