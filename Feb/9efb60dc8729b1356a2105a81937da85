CPS has said it will not agree to continue with the contract after the Constitutional Court said the current contract was illegal. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has again said it promises that all beneficiaries will receive their social grant in April but won t say what kind of negotiations it will now have with the company that makes the payments - Cash Paymaster Services (CPS). CPS has said it will not agree to continue with the contract on the current terms after the Constitutional Court said the current contract was illegal and must stop at the end of March. But the agency has admitted it has not even started to take over the process of negotiating with CPS to ask it to continue and said that no one else qualifies to make the payments. Sassa s Paseka Letsatsi says they ll only start talking in the next few days. Negotiations between us and them will start next week. When we enter into negotiations, it does not mean we are going to appoint this particular person. There might be other problems. The agency has been strongly criticised for delaying an application to the Constitutional Court to ask for the current illegal contract to be allowed to continue.Letsatsi says they went to Parliament with several different options ahead of the end of this contract. The only option which gave us comfort and which we knew was not going to put the lives of beneficiaries at risk, was option one. However, there are other options we need to consider in case something terrible happens. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
