JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Correctional Services Department says it has launched an investigation into the death of two Zonderwater prison inmates in Tshwane after a fire broke out in the facility. The department says its preliminary findings point to gang-related violence as the reason for the blaze on Sunday. Two cells were set alight, claiming the lives of Ernest Malope and Thulani Nkwashu who were serving 15- and 29- year sentences respectively.The department's Ofentse Morwane says investigators are studying the evidence but believe mattresses may have been used to fan the flames. Our mattresses are extremely flammable. In most cases in our facilities, when there s a fire, it s because the inmates use our mattresses. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
