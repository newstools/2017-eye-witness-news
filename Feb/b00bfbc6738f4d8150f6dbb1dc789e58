Treasury says the implication of 3 out of the 30 registered banks should not warrant widespread condemnation of the whole sector. JOHANNESBURG As the Competition Tribunal prepares to investigate allegations of collusion in the markets, Treasury says plans to reform the financial sector are underway.This comes amid claims that 17 banks created fictitious bids and price fixing in international markets involving the value of the rand to the dollar.Three local financial institutions Absa, Standard Bank and Investec have committed to working with authorities.If found guilty they may be fined 10 percent of their annual turnover for nearly a decade.Treasury's Ismail Momoniat says the implication of three out of the over 30 registered banks should not warrant widespread condemnation of the whole finance sector. Even where a bank is being charged Treasury needs to know who is responsible for it. Momoniat says the top management at the implicated banks should also be questioned on why they were not able to detect the collusion. We are in the process of introducing a market regulator to regulate trading and other activities that impact customers. The Treasury says it must be noted that the South African Reserve Bank is a banking supervisor and does not regulate the behaviour of traders on the market.
