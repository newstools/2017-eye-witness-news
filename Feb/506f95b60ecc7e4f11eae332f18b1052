The former ANC treasurer is pleading with Zuma to step down or go down in history as the chief architect of the ANC's destruction. JOHANNESBURG Former African National Congress (ANC) treasurer Mathews Phosa says he s pleading with President Jacob Zuma to go, and to go now, or otherwise go down in history as the chief architect of the ANC s destruction.Phosa has written a column in the Sunday Independent, in which he says the party will be lucky to get anywhere near 50% in the 2019 elections.Phosa is the second member of the ANC s top six, who was elected in Polokwane, to call on Zuma to step down after former Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe made a similar call last year.He says he s been driven to what he calls a Damascus moment by what happened during the State Of the Nation Address (Sona) 10 days ago, and particularly by the refusal of National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to hold a moment s silence for the people who died in the Life Esidimeni tragedy.Phosa says he refuses to be a part of the intellectual funeral of the ANC and he refuses to be associated with so-called leaders who trample on the people who voted them into office.This strong language mirrors that of Save South Africa convener Sipho Pityana and the comments of other former ANC leaders who have called on Zuma and his national executive council to resign.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
