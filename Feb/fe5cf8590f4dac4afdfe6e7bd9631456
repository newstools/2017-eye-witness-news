JOHANNESBURG The United States embassy in Harare has criticised the arrest and detention of protest pastor Evan Mawarire, saying it's an attack on freedom of expression.But President Robert Mugabe's government has hit back, telling embassy officials to go hang on a banana tree. The Zimbabwe government was never going to take this statement from the US embassy on Evan Mawarire lying down.Until now, President Robert Mugabe's government has been cautiously welcoming to the new Trump administration, and now they've chosen to see this criticism as coming from Obama-era officials.George Charamba, Mugabe's spokesperson, told The Herald that those in the US embassy were left over from what he said was a terrible era and they could go hang on a banana tree.On Monday the embassy said that Mawarire's arrest would limit the right of Zimbabweans to freely express themselves.
