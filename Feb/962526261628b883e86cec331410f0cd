President Jacob Zuma is set to deliver his annual speech at Parliament at 7pm on Thursday amid tight security. CAPE TOWN/JOHANNESBURG - As President Jacob Zuma prepares to deliver his much anticipated State of the Nation Address (Sona), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called on its members to show support for the party s Members of Parliament (MPs) by coming out in the numbers to attend the event. Zuma is expected to deliver his annual speech at Parliament at 7pm tonight, amid tight security.There s been outrage since the announcement this week that more than 400 soldiers will be deployed to Parliament to beef up security.Meanwhile, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says he s expecting a positive Sona.He was speaking on the sidelines of the Mining Indaba in Cape Town.Zwane says he is looking forward to the event. We have full confidence in our president and we will support whatever comes out of the Sona. As we re implementers [sic] on the ground, we will ensure that what he talks about is exactly what we re going to implement to the people of South Africa. At the same, Save SA convener Sipho Pityana says corruption in South Africa has become a syndicated international project that is increasingly becoming a bigger threat to the country s economy.On Wednesday Pityana blasted President Zuma during what Save SA called the 'Real State Of The Nation Address' in Cape Town.He s cited the National Treasury and changes that happened there in 2015 as one of the main problems facing South Africa. It hits right at the heart of the future of this country, a threat to its sovereignty and an attack on Treasury about overrunning Treasury so that there is looting. The consequence of that would be destabilising, and not only for the economy. Make sure you avoid these roads on Thursday when President Jacob Zuma delivers the 2017 Sona in Parliament.
