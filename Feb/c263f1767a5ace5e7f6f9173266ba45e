The Deputy Finance Minister was speaking at a Daily Maverick event on Thursday following the budget speech. CAPE TOWN - Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas says state capture should be thoroughly discussed and researched or the country risks developing a parallel government.He was speaking at a Daily Maverick event on Thursday following the budget speech.Jonas says a parallel government could hold dire consequences for a country. We [government] are sitting in one space but in fact decisions are taken elsewhere, but it also over time has the potential of eroding the legitimacy of the state. He says the matter should be researched and discussed by society to avoid a downfall. If you ignore the importance of the media and civil society you do so at your own peril because you have that vibrancy and that space, that is why some people want their own newspapers and TV stations. He further warns selfish interests will drive the trajectory of the country if citizens are not active.Last year, Jonas claimed the Guptas, who are close to President Jacob Zuma, offered him R600 million and the Finance minister job in return for special concessions.(Edited by Neo Koza)
