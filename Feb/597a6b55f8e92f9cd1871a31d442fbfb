On Friday, President Zuma said he had decided not to suspend or institute an inquiry into the fitness of the two to hold office. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling on President Jacob Zuma to reverse his decision regarding the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) s Lawrence Mrwebi and Nomgcobo Jiba.On Friday, President Zuma said he had decided not to suspend or institute an inquiry into the fitness of the two to hold office.He said that he had considered representations made by the pair and had decided not to take any action until a court process had been concluded.The party says regardless of the outcome of the appeal process, both Jiba and Mrwebi have demonstrated that they are not fit and proper to hold the office within the NPA.They have come under fire for their handling of the fraud and corruption cause against former crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli.The DA s Glynnis Breytenbach says, We re disappointed as Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi are not fit to be part of the NPA, whether they re on the Roll of Advocate or not is irrelevant and the president should act now. She added that President Zuma allowed for the general counsel of the bar to bring the striking off application when he should have launched the action himself. Now he is waiting for the outcome of the appeal, whereas the one thing has nothing to do with the other. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
