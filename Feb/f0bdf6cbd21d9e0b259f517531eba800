Around 300 DA members are expected to cast their vote to fill the vacant position this weekend in Worcester. CAPE TOWN - Mudslinging and racial profiling have marked the campaign for front runners for the Democratic Alliance (DA)'s Western Cape interim leader position.Around 300 DA members are expected to cast their vote to fill the vacant position this weekend in Worcester.This follows Patricia de Lille's resignation earlier this month.Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela says some of his competitors claim he can't take up the position as he does not represent the majority race in the province. It s about diverse leadership that reflects the demographics of the province and the country. But that not necessarily mean you can single out an individual and say so and so cannot stand in this position because we have so many people who are of this particular race . We cannot have that. Chief whip Shaun August says he s also been dragged through the mud in the media. There were a lot of allegations against me. People said I was corrupt. If I was corrupt the party would have chased me away. If I was corrupt the mayor would have kept me out of the position. August was found guilty by the party s federal executive earlier this year for not following procurement rules.(Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
