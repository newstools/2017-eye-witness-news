The ANCWL accused Gordhan of sabotaging the ANC&#8217;s radical economic transformation agenda by delivering 'an incoherent speech'. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) has criticised Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan for delivering a Budget speech, that it says is inconsistent with President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation Address.In his address, Gordhan said he agrees with Zuma that a new perspective on economic transformation is required.However, he added transformation without economic growth is unsustainable.The ANCWL has stopped short of accusing Gordhan of sabotaging the ANC s radical economic transformation agenda by delivering what the league calls an incoherent speech.General Secretary Meokgo Matuba says that radical socio-economic transformation must not be watered down by anyone to please ratings agencies. She says they are also disappointed that the minister didn't adequately address the corruption in the banking sector.While Gordhan expressed concern about both a decline in tax revenue and the running of the South African Revenue Service, the league has applauded Sars, saying its been performing exceptionally well under the leadership of Tom Moyane.WATCH: The 2017 budget in 60 seconds(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
