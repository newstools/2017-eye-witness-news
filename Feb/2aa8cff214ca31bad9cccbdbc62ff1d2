On Friday, the court turned down the agency's application to appeal previous judgments by two lower courts set aside, saying there are no prospects for success. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says a Constitutional Court's decision not to hear a South African National Roads Agency Limited s (Sanral) appeal indicates there was no justification for tolling in the Western Cape.On Friday, the court turned down the agency's application to appeal previous judgments by two lower courts set aside, saying there are no prospects for success.The Western Cape High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal had found the agency's attempts to toll routes in the Winelands and Cape Town invalid.The City's Brett Herron says they've said from the onset that the decision-making was unlawful. The board of Sanral didn t properly consider the matter properly, the ministers didn t consider it properly and the socio-economic impact wasn t taken into account. We also argue that there was inadequate public consultation because the public consultation wasn t meaningful. Herron says tolling would have placed a burden on residents. The good news for Cape Town and the Western Cape is the Constitutional Court ordered that it will not entertain another appeal by Sanral. The tolling of the N1 and N2 would have a dire effect on residents, particularly the poor who live on the outskirts of the city. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
