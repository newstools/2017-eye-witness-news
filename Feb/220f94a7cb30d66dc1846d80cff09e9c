Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi insists he had no knowledge that patients were being moved from the Life Esidimeni hospitals. CAPE TOWN - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has moved to set the record straight that Life Esidimeni patients in Gauteng were not moved because government ran out of money.Motsoaledi made a statement in the National Assembly this afternoon, apologising to the victims' families - three of whom were in the public gallery.This as the DA's Wilmot James said 102 people had died as a result of being transferred to NGOs.Until now, government has only said that more than 100 people died.Motsoaledi says the Gauteng Health Department had the money to care for 2,000 mentally ill patients, but he insists he had no knowledge that patients were being moved from the Life Esidimeni hospitals and that it was not part of the health department s policy.&quot;Unfortunately, the Gauteng Health Department was able to convince the court they were honouring the plans, that they will not deviate from the agreement, that when they move the patients it will be in line with the agreement.&quot;Motsoaledi says 700 patients still need to be placed. He s promised an inquest will be held for all those who died. There is no way that anything will be swept under the carpet. The minister says it is up to the NPA to decide whether to prosecute officials involved in the scandal.
