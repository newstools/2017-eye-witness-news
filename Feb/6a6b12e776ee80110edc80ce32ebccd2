I don t know. Since last year, this speculation has been there but it has never happened. Just forget about it. I will tell you when I want to tell you. In December, political analysts said Zuma could not repeat the same mistake as the axing of Nhlanhla Nene as Finance Minister.He fired Nene in December 2015 and replaced him with Des Van Rooyen, sending the markets into a tail spin.However, Zuma said South Africans that needed to understand the economic reasons why he fired Nene. President Zuma said the nation reacted the way it did to his decision because they are not alert and aware of what is happening in the economy.He questioned how South Africans would react if he was to take a similar decision. If the president takes another decision, are we ready? (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
