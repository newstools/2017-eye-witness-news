Yes we re investigating that and I think we re at an advanced stage with that investigation and we ll be issuing a report soon. At the same time, Chairman of the board of City Power Reverend Frank Chikane said the power utility s managing director will remain in his position.Although he said he believes the power utility s board is right to say it can t suspend Xulu at this point, Reverand Chikane was asked if the board still has confidence in Xulu. He s MD of City Power and will continue as MD of City Power until this investigation is done. Chikane could not confirm or refute allegations that the mayor has been putting pressure on the board to suspend Xulu, saying he doesn t want to answer questions that involve his interactions with the mayor.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
