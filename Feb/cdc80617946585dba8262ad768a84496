Business rescue company Sturns has told Parliament&#8217;s mineral resources committee that current conditions are too risky. CAPE TOWN - It is unlikely that the bodies of three Lily Mine workers will be retrieved unless an investor is found to re-open the mine, Parliament s mineral resources committee heard on Wednesday.Business rescue company Sturns says current conditions are too risky.But the committee says it s unacceptable that there s no certainty that the bodies will ever be retrieved.It s also unclear how the money will be raised to pay the families of the victims.It s been a year since Pretty Nkambule, Yvonne Mnisi and Solomon Nyirenda fell to their deaths in a container which sunk underground.Sturns official Rob Devereux told Parliament it s been a struggle to raise the R200 million needed to re-open the mine.The ANC s Mandla Mandela demanded a candid declaration from Devereux about what this meant for the retrieval of the deceased workers.Devereux said a date was likely to be set next week on when an inquiry would be launched.[WATCH] Lily Mine: A forgotten tragedy(Edited by Tamsin Wort)
