CAPE TOWN - Two suspects arrested after they forgot a parcel filled with rhino horn and ivory at a restaurant have been deported. They left their loot at an eatery in Hout Bay earlier this week. When they returned to fetch the backpack, staff informed them that their goods had been handed to the police. They were arrested shortly after arriving at the police station inquiring about the illegal products. The Hawks Lloyd Ramovha says they appeared in the Wynberg Magistrates Court on Thursday. The two Chinese nationals arrested earlier this week were sentenced to five years in prison which was suspended for five years. They were ordered to pay an amount of R35,000 - half of which will go to the Western Cape Conservation Board. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
