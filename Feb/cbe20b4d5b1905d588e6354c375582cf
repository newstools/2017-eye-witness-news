The Victims of Crime Survey released on Tuesday lists laziness and corruption as some of the reasons for public mistrust. JOHANNESBURG Public trust of the SAPS has shown little improvement, with a noticeable decline in the level of satisfaction with police, amongst all population groups except Indian/Asians.According to the Victims of Crime Survey released on Tuesday, corruption as well as a failure to respond on time, are two major causes for dissatisfaction with police services. Most households in KwaZulu-Natal (58,9%), Limpopo (54,8%) and Gauteng (53,6%) reported police laziness as one of the reasons why they are not satisfied. Gauteng (53,1%) and KwaZulu-Natal (41,8%) had the highest percentage of households who attributed corruption for their dissatisfaction with the police.Interrogating issues of accessibility, part of the report indicates that police stations are most accessible in the Western Cape than in any other province, with over 98% of households able to reach a police station in less than an hour. According to the data, Limpopo is the province with least accessibility to police stations. The report further states the North West has the worst police response time to emergency calls where more than 50% of the households reported that it takes more than two hours. South African households think that police visibility has in general been declining between 2011 and 2016. Asked about how often they saw police in uniform and on duty in their area of residence, the Northern Cape had the highest visibility with 50.8% of households who reported to have seen police patrolling in their area at least once a day. KwaZulu-Natal recorded the worst police visibility with over 20% of households saying they have never seen a police officer in uniform in their area. (Edited by Neo Koza)
