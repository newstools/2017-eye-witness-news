Lobby group AfriForm announced on Tuesday that Gerrie Nel would be the head of a private prosecuting unit. PRETORIA - Advocate Gerrie Nel has dismissed claims that the establishment of a private prosecuting unit is an attempt to create a parallel justice system. Lobby group AfriForm announced on Tuesday that as of then, Nel would be the head of such a unit.The office will take up matters the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) decides not to prosecute despite there being sufficient evidence for the matter to go to trial. Advocate Nel says it s simply not true that his new office at AfriForum creates a parallel justice system. I think there s one justice system and I support the one justice system of the NPA. If they prosecute matters, we have no right to prosecute matters that they prosecute. It s only once the prosecution authority decided not to, that we will just pick those matters up and if there is any merit to prosecute them. He says their cases will be carefully selected. We will go through a selection criteria, select our matters and we will take the matters on. Nel says he leaves the NPA without any grievances or ill-will towards prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams.
