The SACP says Brian Molefe should have had a cooling-off period after resigning from Eskom following the state capture report. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) in the North West says it wasn't consulted about the provincial African National Congress (ANC)'s decision to nominate former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe to a place on the province's parliamentary list.The SACP has criticised the decision and says he should have had a cooling-off period after resigning from Eskom following the Public Protector's report on his relationship with the Gupta family.Molefe's nomination as a Member of Parliament was announced on Friday, leading to speculation that President Jacob Zuma could be preparing to remove Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, or his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.The SACP s North West provincial secretary, Madoda Sambatha, says this has echoes of how Mosebenzi Zwane was suddenly nominated to Parliament and then appointed mineral resources minister.He adds they weren't consulted or told of the move before it was made public.Luthuli House has not spoken about the nomination publicly, but the ANC in the North West says Molefe is a good person to have in Parliament, adding he's innocent of any wrongdoing until proven guilty.However, Sambatha is not happy. He should have been allowed to cool off as an individual and a member of the ANC. His deployment was a quick deployment as if there s something he should go and do. On Monday, the ANC s national executive committee met to discuss policy documents ahead of its policy conference. Officials say they discussed only policy issues.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
