The roads agency had gone to the highest court in the land to have previous judgments by two lower courts set aside. JOHANNESBURG The proposed tolling of the N1 and N2 highways in Cape Town is almost certainly dead in the water after the Constitutional Court dismissed South African National Roads Agency Limited s (Sanral) case.The roads agency had gone to the highest court in the land to have previous judgments by two lower courts set aside.The Western Cape High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal found the agency's attempts to toll routes in the Winelands and Cape Town invalid.On Friday, the Constitutional Court refused to entertain the application. The City's Brett Herron says the verdict puts to bed a five-year legal battle. The Constitutional Court found that there were no prospects for success, and I think we can say the Winelands tolling project is buried. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
