CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has been given the green light to go ahead with a MyCiTi bus route in Wynberg following a two-year legal battle.A full bench of the Western Cape High Court on Friday upheld the municipality's appeal and dismissed a 2015 judgement which ruled in favour of 26 families in Wynberg's South Road, who claim they were not adequately consulted.Friday's ruling means the city can move forward with plans to extend the Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha bus routes to Wynberg and Claremont.The city's Brett Herron says the high court has ruled that the proper process was followed. The court found that we had commenced public participation in August 2014, that we conducted ourselves lawfully and reasonably and that communities had been given an opportunity to make meaningful input. The South Road Families Association's Clive Muller says the verdict is disheartening. It s disappointing that the city could get away with doing illegal and unconstitutional things and for the judge to side with the city. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
