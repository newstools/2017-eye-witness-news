BARCELONA - Barcelona provisionally went top of La Liga for the first time since October after Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi scored in a 6-0 thrashing of Alaves on Saturday although the win was overshadowed by a serious injury to Aleix Vidal.Suarez turned in a cross from Vidal in the 37th minute to give Barca the lead over the Basques, who they will meet in the King s Cup final, and Neymar pounced on an error from goalkeeper Fernando Pacheco in the 40th.Messi hit the ball under a hapless Pacheco for the third in the 59th minute to complete a full house for the MSN trident, while an own goal by Alexis Ruano, a thumping strike from Ivan Rakitic and a volley by Suarez completed the rout.The Uruguayan, who was sent off at the end of Tuesday s 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid which sealed Barca s place in the King s Cup final, moved one goal ahead of Messi at the top of the league s scoring charts with 18 strikes.

I leave here feeling good from a footballing perspective, for our performance and the result, but frustated by Aleix s injury and what it means for him, Barca coach Luis Enrique told reporters. Seeing one of your team mates suffer a serious injury is ugly for everyone. We have to try and support him. We have to wait and see but it looks to be very serious.
