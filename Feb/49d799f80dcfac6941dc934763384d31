26 families in Wynberg&#8217;s South Road could head to the Constitutional Court to appeal the municipality's decision to construct a MyCiTi bus route where they live. CAPE TOWN - A group of Wynberg residents looking down the barrel of possible eviction say their battle is far from over despite losing a court battle against the City of Cape Town.The 26 families in Wynberg s South Road could head to the Constitutional Court to appeal the municipality's decision to construct a MyCiTi bus route where they live.A full bench of the Western Cape High Court found that proper consultation processes were followed, rejecting claims this was not done.The South Road Families Association's Clive Muller says they are considering approaching the highest court in the land. In this day and age houses can be thrown down in a country with a backlog of housing to make way for unnecessary infrastructure, like that bus route which is going nowhere. The City's Brett Herron says the previous interdict prevented them from visiting the public comments. We re now able to assess the comments by the public, finalise the proposed route and take it to council over the next few months. He adds they are still not certain whether any property will be affected in the construction. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
