The DA in North West says the money allocated to erect the statue should be used to fund Ipid to complete its Marikana probe. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West says money allocated to the erection of a six metre bronze statue of President Jacob Zuma would be better spent on improving the lives of South Africans.Last week North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo announced that the statue will be erected in Groot Marico, outside Rustenburg in honour of the President.DA leader in the province Joe McGluwa has described the statue as a monument of corruption and unemployment and that it will be the Nkandla of the North West.McGluwa says the money should be used to fund Ipid to complete its Marikana investigation in line with the Farlam Commission s remedial action. This money could have been spent better within our province and also directing this money to the people of Marikana who actually have suffered the most, instead of doing this for the President. We also think this money can be better utilised to assist Ipid to in this regard and also to get closer as far as to what happened at the Marikana massacre.
