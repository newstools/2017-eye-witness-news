On the recent three high-profile resignations, Bonginkosi Madikizela says any leader would be concerned about losing leaders. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance s (DA) interim Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela says he s concerned by about the recent resignation from three high-profile positions within the party. Beaufort West Mayor Djorge Maloyi is the latest member to resign from his post, citing 'family matters' as the reason. DA Western Cape caucus chairperson Rodney Lentit resigned from the provincial legislature on Monday. These resignations follow Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille s decision to step down as the party s provincial leader in January. Madikizela visited Beaufort West on Sunday and says a number of challenges have arisen in the Central Karoo district since the DA formed a coalition government with several small parties following the local government elections. As a leader I had to step in and convene a meeting with our collision partners so they can deal with some of the challenges. The unfortunate thing that happened yesterday was the resignation of our mayor, which was a personal issue and we wish him all the best. He continues to be our member. On the recent resignations, Madikizela says any leader would be concerned about losing leaders. It must be noted that these are the issues that happened before my election as the leader and what I think we need to do now is to deal with some of the challenges and unite our members. Of course, I m concerned but there actually no reason to be concerned from our members.
