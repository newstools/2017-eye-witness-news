The former race driver says the country's history in the sport sees them deserve another opportunity to host it. MONACO - Former Formula One driver David Coulthard says that South Africa should host a Formula One Grand Prix in the future and has thrown his weight behind it being hosted at the newly revamped Kyalami circuit.Previous owner Bernie Ecclestone has in recent years expressed his desire for a race to be held in Cape Town but said that he was never presented with a comprehensive plan in order for that to happen. The business has now been bought by Liberty Media with a revamp of how the sport is run expected.Coulthard, who was speaking ahead of the Laureus World Sports Awards in Monaco, has been out to South Africa recently where he spent some time in Johannesburg and when asked by Eyewitness News about the country hosting a race again was adamant that it should.&quot;That track is ready to go. The investment that has been made has made it a turnkey solution. The driver's would love the challenge because it has retained a lot of the character of the race track, I think it has got what the FIA agreed to and I think it's just a formality to being capable of hosting Formula One.&quot;The former race driver says the country's history in the sport sees them deserve another opportunity to host it.&quot;To have a true World Championship, you've got to be in the continent and if you look at the popularity and success that South Africa has had in Formula One in the past - a world champion and many great Grand Prix's here.&quot;Coulthard says it would be a race that he'd welcome onto the F1 calendar.&quot;Let's wait and see as the new contracts come up for renewal, whether there really is an appetite to go there. But from my point of view, why would we not go there? There's a fan base as you know, cars are celebrated there and there's a wonderful reception, I've spent a bit of time there doing different events outside of going to the race track, so I'd be delighted.&quot;
