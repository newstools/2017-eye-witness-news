JOHANNESBURG Wits University vice chancellor Adam Habib says the institution will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment or abuse.The university has dismissed a senior professor who has been found guilty of sexually harassing three of his female colleagues.Eyewitness News revealed last week how the senior academic targeted and sexually harassed two female lecturers and an office administrator at the institution over a period of time.After months of investigation by an external panel who found the professor did indeed sexually harass three of his female colleagues, the university has now dismissed him with immediate effect.Habib says, As a result and as per our policies, I have informed the individual that he is to be dismissed. He says the university doesn't condone any form of gender-based harm. As a public institution we have to be demonstrating leadership in this regard. The women laid a complaint against the professor at the university s Gender Equity Office late last year, accusing him of inappropriate conduct and using his position to elicit sexual favours.Habib says the university wants to lead by example and address gender-based harm on its campuses.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
