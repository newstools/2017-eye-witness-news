A court ruled against the SABC&#8217;s application to appeal findings that Hlaudi Motsoeneng cannot hold any position at the SABC. CAPE TOWN - Some Members of Parliament (MPs) have described the SABC s move to appeal a High Court ruling against former executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng as 'outrageous' and 'reckless'.The ad hoc committee members are probing the fitness of the public broadcaster s board to hold office.Members have raised their concerns during its discussions about the responses to the committee's draft report earlier on Tuesday.Last week the Western Cape High Court ruled against the SABC s application to appeal its findings that Motsoeneng cannot hold any position at the public broadcaster.MPs questioned who authorised this action given the fact that an SABC board does not exist.Committee member Fana Mokoena says acting SABC CEO James Aguma should explain his actions to the Communications Minister. When there is an inquiry in process, why do they go and make such terrible decisions on behalf of the SABC? MP Jabulani Mahlangu says someone needs to be held accountable. When people take reckless decision, they should pay out of their own pockets because surely we cannot allow a situation where public funds are just used recklessly by people who are employed by the state. But inquiry chair Vincent Smith has reminded MPs the oversight of the broadcaster is the responsibility of the communications portfolio committee.
