King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu was quoted as saying that South Africa was not ready for female leadership. JOHANNESBURG - The Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) says recent comments by King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu about women in leadership constitute a violation of some of the basic human rights enshrined in the Constitution.The king was quoted this week as saying that the country was not ready for female leadership because all democratic presidents were men who have still not managed to turn things around in the country.Sigcawu was speaking at a gathering at his Nqadu Great Place in the Eastern Cape during a visit by former African Union chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.The CGE says it is fully aware of the challenges faced by women, which include patriarchal values and practices which continue to underpin the political system. The commission s spokesperson Javu Baloyi says: As the CGE, we want to make sure that society embraces existing inequality and also move forward, we want to ensure that we leave a legacy of equality whereby both men and women are able to obtain any position that is required of it.
