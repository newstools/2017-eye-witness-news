JOHANNESBURG - The Proteas kick off their New Zealand tour on Friday morning with a one-off T20 against the Black Caps.Their scheduled warm-up match on Tuesday was lost due to rain. Chris Morris says it's not all bad news: &quot;I think it has its positives. Obviously, we would've liked to have played. We've played quite a lot of cricket in recent weeks so it was quite nice to relax, get the body going again, hit the gym, and get a rub down from the physio. Blessing in disguise is the way I look at it.&quot;Morris says the short time between series can't be used as a reason for poor performances. &quot;We all accepted the fact that there was going to be a quick turnaround. We knew we didn't have the usual recovery time that we would have before a tour. We have a 'no excuses' policy. We knew there was going to be a bit of jet lag which we got over quickly. When it comes to practices and game time there are no excuses, just get on with your training. As soon as the game starts, we need to be there physically and mentally.&quot;Morris says the dimensions at Eden Park might force some bowlers to change their lengths. &quot;It was a bit of a shock to my system when I got here and looked at the straight boundaries. Every stadium has its own dynamics that you have to get used to. If the ball is in your area, you need to hit it in that area. It does change your approach a little bit but you have to adapt to any field you play on.&quot;The match gets underway at 08.00 CAT.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
