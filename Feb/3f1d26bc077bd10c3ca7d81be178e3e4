A late penalty by Ricardo Nascimento clinched a first ever African Super Cup for Mamelodi Sundowns as they beat TP Mazembe 1-0. PRETORIA A late penalty by centre back Ricardo Nascimento clinched a first ever African Super Cup for South African club Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday as they beat TP Mazembe Englebert, of the Democratic Republic of Congo, 1-0 at Loftus Versfeld.The 83rd-minute spot-kick was all the home side had to show for a dominant performance in which only Mazembe goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo stood between Sundowns and a runaway score.The Ivory Coast international goalkeeper pulled off a host of brilliant stops to keep his side in the game until full back Issam Mpeko was penalised for a wild lunge on Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana and Brazil-born Nascimento stepped up to convert.Sundowns winger Anthony Laffor had three close-range efforts saved by Gbohouo while a series of other chances also went begging.It was Sundowns' first triumph in the African Super Cup, an annual one-off game between the winners of the continent's two major club competitions, the Champions League and the African Confederation Cup, having won the Champions League for the first time in October.That goal scoring feeling. #Sundowns #CAFSuperCup pic.twitter.com/N7jNqdtiPD
