Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s says this is because South Africa&#8217;s third largest network provider failed to pay lenders by the due date. JOHANNESBURG Standard &amp; Poor s (S&amp;P) Global has downgraded Cell C to a &quot;D&quot; rating, sending it deeper into junk status. The agency says this is because South Africa s third largest network provider failed to pay lenders by the due date.The company has blamed a weakening rand and inflation as some of the reasons for increased costs.S&amp;P Global says Cell C missed interest payments and has been given the &quot;d&quot; rating for defaulting. The agency had rated Cell C's 400 million senior secured bonds at &quot;cc&quot; as it was concerned that a default was imminent. The company has been working with Blue Label Telecoms to reduce its debt.This includes a planned 45% acquisition of the country's third largest network provider. However, apart from the downgrade, S&amp;P Global says it notes that Cell C has not sought bankruptcy protection and expects that it will continue to operate and meet its payroll and supplier obligations.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
