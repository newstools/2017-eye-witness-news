The Finance Minister says that government is expected to spend R1.56 trillion in the coming year and is likely to collect just R1.41 trillion in revenue. JOHANNESBURG Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan broke down his 2017 Budget Speech which he delivered in Parliament on Wednesday. News from the minister is that government is expected to spend R1.56 trillion in the coming year and is likely to collect just R1.41 trillion in revenue.On growth and transformation, Gordhan says the aim is to get more South Africans to participate in the economy, and earning an income so as to contribute taxes particularly income tax. He says while tax systems around the world are likely the major redistributive mechanisms in society, in a country such as South Africa where there are large gaps in income, wealth and employment, more needs to be done to ensure the mechanism works.Gordhan announced on Wednesday that South Africans earning more than R1.5 million per annum will be taxed 45% of their taxable income. Why this amount? We didn t want it too high or too low at this level we probably bring in somewhere between R3.5 billion and R4 billion, which is significantly of reasonable help when balancing the books. The minister says the increase is not to exploit the super-rich, but rather to address the issue of the maldistribution of wealth in the country.WILL THE BUDGET FEND OFF DOWNGRADE WOES?Economist are sceptical that the Finance Minister s speech will do enough to ditch rating downgrades.Thirteen cents out of every rand of collected revenue goes towards servicing national debt. This will potentially grow should the country receive a ratings downgrade this year.In December 2016, Standard &amp; Poors s (S&amp;P) Global put South Africa at BBB-minus with a negative outlook, which is one level above sub-investment grade, while Moody s and Fitch announced they will be keeping their ratings unchanged. But Fitch adjusted its outlook to negative.S&amp;P Global rates the country one notch above junk status and it s hoped that the country can avoid a downgrade. The minister says the discussion around value-added taxes (VAT) is ongoing to alleviate this. We are certainly not dismissing VAT but you can t just overnight impose something new which all studies I am aware of indicate that VAT is a very regressive tax. Gordhan says he hopes Wednesday s speech gets the conversation going about how VAT can be used to grow the coffers.
