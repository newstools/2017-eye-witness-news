Krejcir and his four co-accused are expected to finally enter a plea in the High Court in Johannesburg. JOHANNESBURG Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir is expected to plead on Tuesday as his trial for allegedly killing Lebanese drug dealer Sam Issa begins in the High Court in Johannesburg. Krejcir and four others are accused of arranging and carrying out the gang-land style hit in Bedfordview in 2013. After numerous delays and postponements, Krejcir and his four co-accused are expected to finally enter a plea.The trial is set down for several weeks but it's unclear if it will actually run for that period of time. Krejcir and co-accused Bulgarian Lybohir Grigorov allegedly orchestrated the hit on Issa and the three others were the hit men who carried out the shooting. The State is expected to use a number of section 204 witnesses who will receive indemnity for their testimony, as well as cellphone and other corroborating evidence.
