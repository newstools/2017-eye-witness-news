South African Airways now has to pay Comair over R1 billion for anti-competitive behavior after a 14-year-legal battle between the two airlines. JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways (SAA) says it has noted the High Court s judgment ordering it to pay Comair over R1 billion for anti-competitive behavior, saying it is seeking legal counsel.The judgement, handed down on Wednesday morning, comes after a 14-year-legal battle between the two airlines.Comair accused SAA of implementing an incentive scheme to travel agents, which kept the agents loyal to the state-owned airline to the exclusion of its competitors and in violation of the Competition Act.Comair is the second airline to succeed in a claim against the national carrier concerning anti-competitive conduct.Last year, the court ruled in favour of Nationwide Airlines, awarding it over R100 million.The High Court in Johannesburg found that SAA had agreements with travel agents from 2001 when it paid them to divert customers.The national carrier now has to pay Comair R554 million plus interest at 15.5% for their conduct.SAA spokesperson Tladi Tladi says they have noted the judgement. What will happen going forward is that the airline will take counsel from its legal representatives. Comair says because this was a complex and long matter, it needs time to study the ruling.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
