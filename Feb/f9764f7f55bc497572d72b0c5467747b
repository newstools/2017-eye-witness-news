Julius Malema says Zuma has broken his oath of office, therefore he cannot address Members of Parliament and vows to hold him accountable. CAPE TOWN Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has vowed to continue to hold President Jacob Zuma accountable whenever he is in Parliament. Parliamentary Protection Services officials earlier ejected the EFF MP'S after they refused to obey orders from the presiding officers. Malema says Zuma has broken his oath of office, therefore he cannot address Members of Parliament. We are not going to be intimidated by soldiers, by police or criminals who are hell bent at defending a constitutional delinquent a man who is prepared to violate the Constitution. They are ready to chase out people who break the rules of Parliament but prepared to defend a man who broke his oath of office. WATCH: Sona 2017 descends into chaos(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
