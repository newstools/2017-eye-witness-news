CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has moved its Eastern Cape elective congress amid tense contestation for leadership positions.The party s members were to choose a new provincial leader to replace Athol Trollip in March but it has been rescheduled until May.It s understood that the nominations for key leadership positions have been made but the party will not release them as yet. It s believed that current provincial chairperson Veliswa Mvenya, looking to be the first woman to lead the DA in the Eastern Cape, is one of the front-runners.DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe says the vast distances in the province has delayed the branch audits. We are not in a situation where a majority of branches have formed and have elected their delegates to the congress but there are a number of branches where a process called conjoining needed to happen where there were less than required minimum to form a branch.
