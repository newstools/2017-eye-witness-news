Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba revealed to Parliament that the number of mentally-ill patients who died had surpassed the 100 mark. CAPE TOWN - Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba says the death toll in the Esidimeni tragedy is expected to rise. Makgoba revealed to Parliament that the number of mentally-ill patients who died as a result of being transferred from the Gauteng facility had surpassed the 100 mark.Earlier this month, the death toll stood at 94 but he says more families are stepping forward with information about relatives who died. Makgoba says that from the outset of his investigation, it was clear that 94 would not be the final death count in the Life Esidimeni matter.His investigation is now complete, but Makgoba says the shambolic state of data from the Gauteng Health Department continues to reveal more deaths. I can confirm that we are well above 100 at the moment. A cut-off point will have to be decided and that will need to be determined by the various stakeholders who are involved. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says while there have been indications that implicated officials intend to challenge the report, no formal applications have yet been lodged.
