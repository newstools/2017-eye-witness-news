The department of social development says Magwaza did not attend the meeting in Parliament on Tuesday, as he is on sick leave. JOHANNESBURG The Social Development Department says claims that the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Thokozani Magwaza has been suspended are insensitive and invasive to his privacy.The department says Magwaza did not attend the meeting in Parliament on Tuesday, as he is on sick leave.National Development Agency CEO Thamo Mzobe has been appointed in Magwaza's place for the interim.Sassa's Paseka Letsatsi has denied claims that Thokozani Magwaza has been fired saying they are lies created by malicious people. We don t know where the people who are spreading these news are getting them from. It so disappointing, to say the least, they don t even have the decency to consult the spokesperson of Sassa. He has reiterated the need for an interim CEO saying it is unclear how long Magwaza is scheduled to be away. When a person who is holding a position is not around, someone is supposed to act because the wheels of government can t stop because someone is not at work. Letsatsi says a number of organisations including the post office have been approached as plans to ensure grants are paid out on 1 April continue.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
