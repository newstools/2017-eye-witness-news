President Jacob Zuma will address the nation at 7pm on Thursday night where the EFF has threatened not to allow him to speak. CAPE TOWN African National Congress (ANC) leaders say the gathering by party's members in support of President Jacob Zuma at the Grand Parade in Cape Town means a lot for him, especially now that he faces the possibility of disruptions from Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members in Parliament.Zuma will address the nation at 7pm on Thursday night where the EFF has threatened not to allow him to speak.This concern was evident on Wednesday when the African National Congress Women s League (ANCWL) held a prayer service for the State of the Nation address in Phillipi, where they prayed for strength and peace for President Zuma and the Speaker Baleka Mbete.It appears the concern is shared by other ANC national executive committee members.Tony Yengeni says the gathering will assure Zuma, in the face of criticism and disruptions, that ANC members are behind him. This is capturing the strength and support that people are giving to him to say, Let s go ahead Msholozi let s achieve all the objectives that you are going to set out tonight. Meanwhile, some party members have sought cover from the sun and gone back to sit in their buses while they wait for the president's address.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
