It&#8217;s also being reported that Britain could face the equivalent of R100bn in extra costs should it leave the EU without a deal. LONDON - As the Brexit bill is debated in the House of Lords, new reports have emerged about the potential cost of British negotiators failing to strike a deal with the European Union (EU). Almost 200 submissions are being made in the upper house of parliament as a bill required to trigger the divorce enters its final stages. On Friday former prime minister Tony Blair launched a movement to try and reverse Brexit but some have dismissed this as arrogant, given the outcome of the referendum. It s also being reported that Britain could face the equivalent of R100 billion in extra costs should it leave the EU without a deal. Government maintains there are no U-turns. &quot;This bus has left,&quot; said one senior EU diplomat.&quot;No one is happy about it. But we have moved on and the last thing anyone wants now is to reopen the whole issue.&quot;Some still talk of hope: &quot;Despite the hard rhetoric and threats by the British government ... the European Union remains a project of mending,&quot; said German lawmaker Terry Reintke, who speaks on Brexit for the Greens in the European Parliament.&quot;If the UK was to decide to stay a member of the European Union, the Greens will fight against closing the door.&quot; But Germany, France and other big powers worry that being soft on London could lead to a further unravelling of the EU.So even if Prime Minister Theresa May were to seek a &quot;soft Brexit&quot; - under which it would notably retain full access to the EU's single market in return for accepting its rules - many have lost patience with a Britain that has long secured special favours._Additional reporting by Reuters. _ (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
