The Mamelodi Sundowns coach has once again expressed his dissatisfaction with the way the Premier Soccer League schedule looks. JOHANNESBURG - Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has once again expressed his dissatisfaction with how the Premier Soccer League schedule looks, as he feels that his team isn t playing frequently enough.Sundowns are five games behind in the league, having played 12 games and they re set to lose more ground on the rest of the log because of their CAF Champions League commitments.The African champions had some of their matches rescheduled because of their involvement in the Champions League last year, as well as the Fifa Club World Cup in December.Mosimane says his team can t afford to only play one match a week when they have so many games that they must catch up in the four months left in the season. Our game is on Monday, against Mariveni, but I m not playing until the weekend, but I m five games behind. I should be playing Monday, Wednesday or Thursday or Friday. But we can t play because it s a cup week and remember on Thursday and Friday, there s no match. He says he doesn t mind playing non-stop because it s their fault that the fixture list is so congested. The fixtures are going to be congested and we have to play the games. We re not complaining, we caused that congestion going to Japan. I m just saying let's rearrange, because now I m going to stay six or seven days without playing? How can Sundowns stay six or seven days without playing when we re five games behind? The Brazilians attention has turned completely to Saturday s CAF Super Cup match against the Democratic Republic of Congo s TP Mazembe, who won the Confederation Cup last year. That match is taking place at Loftus Versfeld from 19h00.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
