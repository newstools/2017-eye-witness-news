Shakes Mashaba&#8217;s lawyer Claudio Bollo says they failed to reach a suitable agreement with Safa regarding his reinstatement as Bafana Bafana coach. JOHANNESBURG - Shakes Mashaba s lawyer Claudio Bollo has told EWN Sport that they failed to reach a suitable agreement with South African Football Association (Safa) regarding the former Bafana Bafana coach s reinstatement. Mashaba appeared before the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) on Tuesday, to dispute his sacking in December and request that he be given his job back. The 66-year-old was fired for alleged gross misconduct after an on-air altercation in November. Bollo says both parties couldn t come to an amicable agreement: &quot;The conciliation happened. We did have discussions and talks to resolve the matter. We went in with an open mind but unfortunately, no resolution could be obtained. It means we didn t come to a mutually satisfactory settlement at the conciliation. It means Safa didn t offer to the coach a resolution that would ve made him satisfied.&quot;Bollo says they wouldn t have common ground anyway: I don t think we could ve come to a resolution. I m not blaming anyone, that s just the reality of the situation.&quot;Bollo says there s still room to escalate the matter to the Labour Court: &quot;The decisions are quite limited, but there is scope to take it to the Labour Court for review for both parties if they re unhappy. We still feel we have strong merit. Whether we re on the brink of getting what one wants to get, that depends on Safa. Both parties will now wait for a date to appear in the Labour Court.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
