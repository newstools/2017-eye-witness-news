The charges were laid by a policeman, whose wife was killed, allegedly by a group of officers in Tembisa. JOHANNESBURG - Fraud charges have been laid against Gauteng Police Commissioner Major General Deliwe de Lange. The charges were laid by a policeman, whose wife was killed, allegedly by a group of officers in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg, last year. The implicated police officers were found guilty in an internal disciplinary process, but are yet to go on trial for the killing.The officer says De Lange has selectively suspended black officers, who were part of the incident, while allowing a white policeman, colonel Robbie Roberts to continue working in the South African Police Service. Roberts was also allegedly promoted to the ranking of colonel while his disciplinary hearing was underway. The police's Mathapelo Peters says, I can confirm that a fraud case related to station commander of Edenvale Colonel Roberts has been opened against Commissioner Major General De Lange.
