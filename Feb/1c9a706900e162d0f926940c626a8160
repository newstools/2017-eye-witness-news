The owners of land that is being illegally occupied in Philippi East have turned to a high court to compel government to buy them out. WESTERN CAPE HIGH COURT - The owners of land that is being illegally occupied in Philippi East have accused government of failing to protect their property from invasions.They have now turned to the Western Cape High Court to compel government to buy them out.The group initially wanted an eviction order but that bid was abandoned due to the rapid growth of the Marikana informal settlement.Advocate Peter Hodes, representing the property owners, has argued it s apparent that the City of Cape Town and other spheres of government cannot be trusted to safeguard private land.Hodes also claims the city has passed the buck because the municipality is saying that police are liable for the legal costs.According to Hodes, the municipality, which is yet to present its case, blames the South African Police Service (SAPS) for failing to execute its duty by not preventing the occupation.He has admitted that evicting the 60,000 people settled on the private land is practically impossible , which is why the land owners want government to buy the properties.Expropriation of the land is supported by the Socio-Economic Rights Institute, which wants the city to upgrade the informal settlement or provide temporary housing for residents.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
