The investigative unit says earlier reports of a raid at Paul O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s home are utter lies. JOHANNESBURG The Hawks say reports which suggest that it had raided private forensic investigator Paul O'Sullivan's Sandton home on Friday are utter lies.The Hawks say they have not initiated any such investigation.They say it s questionable where these rumours are coming from and why the Hawks s name has been involved in the matter.It was reported earlier that the Hawks have been investigating the forensic consultant for some time and this week it emerged that a so-called special project was being run by the police and several private investigators to bring him down.O Sullivan has recently opened cases against acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and the head of the Hawks and this latest move may be seen as retaliation for this.
