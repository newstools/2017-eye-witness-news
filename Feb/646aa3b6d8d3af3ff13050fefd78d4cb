There's been pressure for a while on the dollar/rand to break lower and now it's happened,&quot; said Jim Bryson, currency trader at Rand Merchant Bank.&quot;Now we need to see a close at around 12.90 to confirm the move and maybe see the rand strengthen further.&quot;The rand kicked off local trade on the front foot as the dollar came under pressure after the resignation of US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
