PUNE - Left-arm spinner Steve O Keefe picked up a career-best six for 35 to help Australia take command of the first Test against India after 15 wickets fell on a bowler-dominated second day of the contest on Friday.Playing only his fifth Test and first in India, O Keefe took all his wickets in the space of 24 deliveries, including three in an over, to trigger a spectacular collapse and help Australia bundle out India for 105 in their first innings.Australia took a first innings lead of 155, a significant advantage on a spin-friendly track at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, which is making its debut as a Test centre.The touring side, who have lost their last nine Tests in Asia and were considered underdogs before the start of the four-match series, reached 143 for four at stumps in their second innings, an overall lead of 298 runs.Captain Steve Smith was unbeaten after a chance-filled 59, during which he was dropped three times, with all-rounder Mitchell Marsh 21 not out.Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin picked up three quick wickets to boost India s hopes of restricting Australia to a low second innings total but Smith and Matt Renshaw (31) then added 52 for the fourth to boost the touring side.Replying to Australia s 260, the world s top-ranked side, unbeaten in their previous 19 Tests, lost their last seven wickets for 11 runs as O Keefe ran through their batsmen to pick up his maiden five-wicket haul.At Tea on Day 2 of the 1st Test, Australia (260 &amp; 46/2) lead India (105) by 201 runs #INDvAUS pic.twitter.com/S9ygf0VUDpO KEEFE HEROICSIndia s meltdown started after lunch when opener Lokesh Rahul fell to O Keefe s bowling.Rahul, who was top scorer for his side with 64, collapsed immediately after playing the shot, clutching his left shoulder and looking as if he was in pain.The dismissal ended a fourth-wicket stand of 50 between Rahul and Ajinkya Rahane and what followed was a procession of batsmen returning to the pavilion.Two deliveries later, Rahane was out for 13 off O Keefe, who also dismissed wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha in the same over.Off-spinner Nathan Lyon picked up Ashwin in the next over before O Keefe wrapped things up with the dismissals of Ravindra Jadeja, Jayant Yadav and Umesh Yadav.Australia paceman Mitchell Starc earlier ripped through India s top order with two wickets in three balls.Cheteshwar Pujara was dismissed for six, while India captain and batting mainstay Virat Kohli was despatched for a two-ball duck on a wicket favouring both pace and spin.Following Kohli s lead, Australia skipper Steve Smith used O Keefe as early as the second over on the dry pitch.India have lost 6-7.
