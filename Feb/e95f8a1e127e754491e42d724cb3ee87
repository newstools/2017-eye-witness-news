A probe by the Health Ombudsman found 94 psychiatric patients died under appalling conditions at unregistered facilities. JOHANNESBURG - Section 27 has welcomed the resignation of Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu, but adds it still wants her to face action over the deaths of nearly 100 psychiatric patients.Mahlangu resigned this week amid the findings of an investigation into the matter. A probe by the Health Ombudsman found the 94 patients died under appalling conditions at unregistered facilities.

That is one of our biggest concerns, that there ll be no disciplinary action after she resigned. I don t think she should be seen as a hero for doing this. She still has to be held accountable and still says she was wasn t really accountable. It s not enough and a slap in the face of the families who are bereaved. The Health Ombudsman found Mahlangu and the department rushed a decision to terminate a contract with Life Esidimeni, and to transfer more than 1,300 mentally ill patients to other facilities.READ the full report below: Life Esidimeni Report - Office of the Health Ombud by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
