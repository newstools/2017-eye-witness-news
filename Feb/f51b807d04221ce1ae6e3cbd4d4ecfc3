Western Cape Premier Helen Zille mentioned plans for the health sector, with a focus on the regional hospital in the Gugulethu and Manenberg area. WESTERN CAPE LEGISLATURE - Opposition parties are not impressed by Western Cape Premier Helen Zille's State of the Province Address (Sopa) saying it failed to tackle fundamental issues faced by residents.Zille delivered her speech earlier on Friday with a major focus on economic growth, but also touched on the need to improve safety and security. She mentioned plans for the health sector, with a focus on the regional hospital in the Gugulethu and Manenberg area.Opposition parties, including the African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), have expressed disappointment at what they call a hollow and uninspiring speech.We appeal to communities to work with us to protect our staff, so that we can focus on saving lives. #WCSOPA pic.twitter.com/iADzvtcdXcANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs says while the address mentioned financial investment in the province, there s no evidence that the poor are benefitting. It works well for few, but for the majority of people the basic services are still not there. They still don t have sanitation and housing. EFF provincial leader Bernard Joseph says there was no plan to tackle crime. Why is there a high crime rate in Nyanga or Manenberg? We ll constantly fall into the trap of not being able to improve. Oppositions MPLs will get an opportunity to interrogate Zille's address during a debate on Tuesday.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
