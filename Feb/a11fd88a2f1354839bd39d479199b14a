With the revenue and economy not growing, South Africans will feel the lack of tax relief.Increases in the excise duties for alcohol and tobaccoThe tax on a 340ml can of beer will increase by about 12 cents per can.Wine will go up by 30 cents a litre, while the tax on spirits will increase by about R4.50 a bottle.The targeted excise duties is the lowest on wine. Fuel tax increaseThere is an increase of 30c/litre in the general fuel levy and 9c/litre in the Road Accident Fund levy.On a tank of petrol, South Africans are looking at a significant tax.No VAT increaseGordhan did not make any mention of VAT increase, however the country could still see VAT increases on petrol and diesel for the first time next year.According to Gordhan, the country has reached the peak of personal income tax.Fischer-French says adding VAT on petrol is massive because an increase in fuel price feeds right through to the economy.WATCH: #Budget2017 - How will it affect you
