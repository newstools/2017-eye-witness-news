The call by the Commission of Gender Equality comes in the wake of a sex scandal at Wits University. JOHANNESBURG The Commission for Gender Equality has called on other institutions of higher learning to ensure that they effectively implement their sexual harassment policies.The call comes in the wake of yet another sex scandal at Wits University, this time involving a senior professor.The senior academic was dismissed this week after being found guilty of sexually harassing three of his female colleagues.Eyewitness News revealed last week how the professor targeted the women over a period of time and used his position to try and elicit sexual favours.The commission's Javu Baloyi says they welcome the dismissal of the professor. That should be commended in all aspects. We believe that even the technical vocational training colleges should follow suit in ensuring that they implement sexual harassment policies.
