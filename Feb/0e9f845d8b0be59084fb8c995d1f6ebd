President Zuma deployed 441 SANDF members to the opening of Parliament last week ahead of his State of the Nation Address. CAPE TOWN - Defence and Military Veterans Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has assured parliamentarians that an investigation is underway to probe the presence of armed soldiers in the parliamentary precinct during the State of the Nation Address (Sona).President Jacob Zuma deployed 441 South African National Defence Force members to the opening of Parliament last week to maintain law and order. Opposition parties came out strongly against the move, calling it a militarisation of Parliament and a declaration of war. But the minister has emphasised that parliamentarians are not seen as a security threat. The members should remember the matter has been subject to a judicial process. The conclusion will assist all of us to better deal with the deployment of the SANDF at national events. At the same time, African National Congress chief whip Jackson Mthembu has called for the Economic Freedom Fighters hard hats to be banned from Parliament. My own view of this matter is that those hard hats should not be allowed on the floor in any of our parliamentary houses. He slammed the manner in which the party's members used them to fight back while being forcefully ejected from the house. WATCH: Sona 2017 descends into chaos(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
