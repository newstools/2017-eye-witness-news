The Institute for Justice and Reconciliation says that its surveys reveal growing economic inequalities have the potential to polarise society even further. CAPE TOWN The Institute for Justice and Reconciliation (IJR) says government needs to clarify what it means by radical economic transformation and how it aligns with the National Development Plan.Ahead of President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation Address, the institute on Monday released its People's State of the Nation Assessment, polling public opinion on the state of South Africa.The surveys reveal growing economic inequalities have the potential to polarise society even further. The Institute for Justice and Reconciliation says there's a gap between the president's annual State of the Nation Address, and the views of broader society.It's found that two-thirds of South Africans believe government is not acting in the country's best interests and that it's doing a very bad job at managing the economy. The Institute says the country's underperforming economy has increased levels of distress and government needs to provide clarity on its economic policies. IJR head of policy Jan Hofmeyr says: That gives people a goal to work towards. It labour, business and civil society an idea it gives us all an idea how we jointly work towards a goal. The institute says failure to address current societal inequalities will only further inhibit nation-building.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
