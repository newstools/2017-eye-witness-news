Centre for Child Law has approached a court to ask provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act be extended to protect child victims. PRETORIA - The Centre for Child Law has argued that the rights of child victims of crimes far outweigh the right to freedom of expression. The centre has approached the High Court in Pretoria to ask that the provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act which protect child offenders and witnesses be extended to protect child victims. The case stems from the matter of Zephany Nurse, who was kidnapped at birth but then discovered her biological parents at the age of 17.The media wanted to identify her when she turned 18. Advocate Steven Budlender described a scenario where a young girl was viciously beaten by her father and the father was convicted of the crime. Because she was not sexually abused, the law, as it is now, does not offer the child automatic protection from being identified. He questioned why a child who has done nothing wrong should be embarrassed, ashamed and traumatised by her identity and the story being splashed on the front pages of newspapers. Advocate Wim Trengove says the media houses are not arguing against protecting child victims of crime but rather how to ensure such protection. He describes a blanket ban on prohibiting identification of child victims of crime as absurd, saying that such decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
