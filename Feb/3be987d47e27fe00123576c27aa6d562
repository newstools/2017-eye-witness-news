It has agreed to pay a penalty of more than R69 million.Citibank has agreed to provide witnesses to help expose others implicated in foreign exchange fraud.Reports say a few local traders have already been suspended including two working for Absa Bank. In the United States, Barclays Jason Katz and Citigroup s Christopher Cummins have already pleaded guilty to price manipulation after an extensive investigation by the Justice Department.Old Mutual strategist Graham Bell says there needs to be full disclosure.
