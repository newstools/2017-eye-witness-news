Science &amp; Technology Minister Naledi Pandor says government must function despite what is happening within the current political landscape. CAPE TOWN Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor says reports of an imminent Cabinet reshuffle have no effect on the work of ministers. Pandor was responding to questions from the media during an economics cluster briefing in Parliament on Tuesday. She says Cabinet is fully functional.Speculation is high that President Jacob Zuma could reshuffle his Cabinet anytime soon, especially following the hasty swearing in of former Eskom head Brian Molefe last week. But the minister says media reports to this effect are not hampering the job of implementing Zuma s plan of radical economic transformation. We sit in Cabinet meetings, we deliberate on matters we bring to Cabinet, we agree, we disagree, we change, we compromise. In a lighter moment, Pandor sought to deflect from ANC politics. The current political environment is quite an interesting one with the changes, particularly Patricia de Lille in the Western Cape, we wonder where she s headed to next.
