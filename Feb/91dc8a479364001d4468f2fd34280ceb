CAPE TOWN - This year's budget review shows South African Airways (SAA) still remains technically insolvent, despite reducing its losses.The national carrier pared its losses from R5.6 billion in 2014/15 to R1.5 billion the year after. While public sector institutions play a key role in achieving the country's developmental goals, they need to be well governed and financially sound in order to deliver on their mandates.SAA now has a new board which Treasury hopes will stabilise the state-owned airline.SAA s controversial chair Dudu Miyeni is expected to stay on for another year, a compromise as she had expected to stay on for another two.Treasury officials say the new board has agreed to appoint an aviation expert.SAA has a R19 billion government guarantee and Treasury is keen to ensure the entity is properly governed as any default on loans will severely impact government finances.Other state-owned companies also face economic difficulties. Eskom is owed R9.7 billion in municipal arrears.Treasury has also highlighted the Road Accident Fund (RAF) as a serious risk. Its total liabilities last year amounted to R155 billion. Treasury has now raised the RAF levy by 9 cents a litre of petrol in a bid to stabilise its finances.WATCH: The 2017 budget in 60 seconds(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
