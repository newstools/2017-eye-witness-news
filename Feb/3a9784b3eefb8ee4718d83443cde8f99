Springbok coach Allister Coetzee said he is very happy to start working with the extended Bok squad so early in the year. JOHANNESBURG - World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year Seabelo Senatla as well as fit-again Springboks such as Handr Pollard, Siya Kolisi, Frans Malherbe and Jaco Kriel, were all included in an extended Springbok training squad for the first of three camps, in Johannesburg.The camp takes place from 5 to 7 March and is the first of three preparations camps the Springboks will undertake as part of their plans before the start of the international season in June when South Africa host France in a three-match Castle Lager Incoming Series.Also included in the squad are five uncapped players who all featured for the Junior Springboks earlier in their careers. They are Ox Nche, Joseph Dweba, Hanro Liebenberg, Warrick Gelant and Wilco Louw.Sharks and Southern Kings players were not considered for the Johannesburg camp because of Super Rugby commitments, while Lions players will leave the camp on Monday as they are travelling with their franchise to Argentina on Tuesday.Springbok coach Allister Coetzee said he is very happy to start working with the extended Bok squad so early in the year. We did a lot of background planning and this camp will give us the opportunity to take the objectives we agreed on at the various indabas, to the training field, said Coetzee. This group was selected before the start of Vodacom Super Rugby so that we could adhere to World Rugby regulations by giving notice of the camp 14 days in advance. SA Rugby CEO, Jurie Roux, said: I want to thank our franchises for their cooperation and releasing their players during Vodacom Super Rugby for the three Springbok camps. Unfortunately, we did not have any of these camps in 2016 and we know it is very important for the players and the coaches to spend as much time together as possible before the start of the season.
