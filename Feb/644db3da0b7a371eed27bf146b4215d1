The DA is keeping mum about the names of party members vying for the tensely contested leadership race in the Eastern Cape. Editor's Note: In an earlier version of this article the headline referred to the race for mayor, when it should have been for provincial leader. EWN apologises for the error.CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) is keeping mum about the names of party members vying for the tensely contested leadership race in the Eastern Cape.Party delegates were to choose a new provincial leader to replace Athol Trollip next month, but the congress has been moved to May.Speculation is that current provincial chair Veliswa Mvenya could be going up against former DA MP Nqaba Bhanga, who is now a councillor in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. DA federal executive chair James Selfe says candidates have already been nominated. They ve come through but I m not at liberty to indicate that at this stage. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
