There are 39 projects that remain. But we would like to emphasise that we will fund this project at a pace that we can afford. Zuma said that the utility will sign the outstanding power purchase agreements for renewable energy.Last year, some parties accused Eskom of refusing to sign the documents.But Phasiwe says the delay was due to a scheduled meeting between them and the Energy Department. So we can give them the context in which we are going to fund this project going forward. Government has heard our side of the story and we re going to continue with the funding of this project.
