Makhosi Khoza has been moved from the Finance Committee and appointed chairperson of Parliament's Public Service and Administration Committee. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) says Member of Parliament (MP) Makhosi Khoza has been moved from the Finance Committee to another area which is more related to her field of expertise.It's been speculated the move is linked to the swearing-in of former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe as an MP on Wednesday and that he could be in line to fill Khoza's position on the Finance Committee, putting him one step closer to a post with Treasury.Khoza, who is also a key member of the ad-hoc committee probing the fitness of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board, has been appointed chairperson of Parliament's Public Service and Administration Committee.That committee's chair resigned last year.Acting ANC caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli says any redeployment is discussed between the MP and Caucus leadership first.She says Khoza's experience and qualifications have been taken into consideration before appointing her as the new chair of Public Service and Administration Portfolio Committee. Dr Khoza has a PhD in Public Administration. She s not unqualified and her work in Parliament speaks for itself. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
