MK veterans also say that they would like interim leaders to preside over the disbandment and appointment of interim provincial committees. JOHANNESBURG - Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans have called for the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) to be disbanded at the national consultative conference and for an interim leadership to be appointed.The MK vets on Wednesday presented the resolutions taken during their national council meeting and their gathering with the top six. They ve supported calls for a national consultative conference to be held before the ruling party s policy gathering to address, amongst other things, how the ANC can resume its vanguard role in society. Former soldier Thabang Makwetla says MK veterans want all ANC leaders to undergo a lifestyle audit and to re-launch ANC branches. The statement of the council was that the NEC of the ANC should disband and that we have interim leadership appointed or nominated by consultative conference to take care of the business of the organization in the interim. The MK vets say they would also like the interim leadership to preside over the disbandment and appointment of interim provincial committees.Last year the group requested a meeting with the ANC s top six at the beginning of 2017 to discuss how to restore unity in the organisation and deal with corruption.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
