Dr Irvin Khoza says disappointment with a match result does not warrant people to engage in acts of violence to express themselves.

Violence has no place in our football. No matter how strong we feel and aggrieved you are, when you engage in violence, you discredit the legitimacy of our feelings and grievances. The chairperson strongly condemned the behaviour of certain Orlando Pirates fans, who damaged property at Loftus Versfeld, after their team suffered a 6-0 hiding at the hands of Mamelodi Sundowns.He says that the perpetrators must face the full might of the law. I pronounce here today that the club's unequivocal, clear and unambiguous position is that the law must take its course. The PSL released a statement of condemnation but have not confirmed what punishment it will hand down.WATCH: Khoza: There is no place for violence in football(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
