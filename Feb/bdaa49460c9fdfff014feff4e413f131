Agri SA says most farmers had to get loans from First Land Bank to ensure that they could survive the drought conditions. JOHANNESBURG - Agri SA says it has no record of farmers who were assisted with drought relief through the R2.5 billion mentioned by President Jacob Zuma in his State of the Nation Address (Sona). The organisation says most farmers had to get loans from First Land Bank to ensure that they could survive the drought conditions. Agri SA s President Johannes Moller says they have approached the Agriculture Department for an outline of how the R2.5 billion was calculated. Farmers from all walks of life have pressed us for help because there was no help coming from the government. Moller says the president s announcement that the Land Expropriation Bill will again be assessed in Parliament shows uncertainty on the part of government. It s completely inextricable to us how the people who wrote this couldn t even coordinate it. Agri SA says it is hoping to get to the bottom of this issue.WATCH: #SONA2017: President Zuma actually spoke.
