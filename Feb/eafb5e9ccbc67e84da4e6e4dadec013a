Parliament confirmed that Brian Molefe will be sworn in soon after he was nominated by the ANC in the North West. JOHANNESBURG - The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) says the appointment of Brain Molefe as an African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament further undermines efforts to ensure ethical and principled leadership in both politics and in business in South Africa.Last week Parliament confirmed that Molefe will be sworn in soon after he was nominated by the ANC in the North West to fill a vacancy in the National Assembly.Molefe resigned from Eskom last year after being implicated in the Public Protector s State of Capture report.It was found that he had communicated regularly with one of the Gupta brothers and was often in the area of the controversial family s compound in Saxonworld amid speculation that Eskom unlawfully awarded a coal supply tender to a Gupta-owned company.Casac s Lawson Naidoo says Molefe s appointment undermines the country s Constitution. We believe it s a sad day for South Africa when someone who is as compromised as Mr Molefe is able to take a seat as the representative of the people in Parliament of South Africa. NORTH WEST ANC TO CLEAR THE AIRThe party in the North West said there will be a press briefing on Monday to clear the air.The provincial party released a statement at the weekend, defending its decision to nominate the former Eskom CEO to fill a vacancy in the National Assembly.When Parliament confirmed that Molefe would be sworn in after he was nominated by the ANC in the North West, questions were raised over which branch he belongs to.The ANC in the province said Molefe is an ANC member in good standing of Ward 29 in the Madibeng Municipality.But Abdullah Milanzi, who claims to be the chairperson of the branch, says they have no records of Molefe. Mr Molefe was never a member of our branch actually. But Bethuel Mmutle, who the provincial party says is the legitimate chairperson of the branch, says Molefe is a member in good standing. I can confirm that he s a member of Ward 29. He s been a member of Ward 29 from 2011. The provincial party maintains it followed the right process to put Molefe on the list to fill the vacancy in the National Assembly.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
