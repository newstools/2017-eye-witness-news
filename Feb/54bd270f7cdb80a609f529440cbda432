Khan&#8217;s plan includes a new so-called toxic charge aimed at motorists whose cars are spewing out too much pollution. LONDON London Mayor Sadiq Khan is this week expected to launch a new plan to fight toxic air pollution. This weekend, Khan warned Londoners about high levels of pollution, urging those with heart or lung problems to avoid exercise. Nationwide, health problems related to toxic air are believed to cause tens of thousands of deaths each year and cost the country billions.. Khan s plan includes a new so-called toxic charge aimed at motorists whose cars are spewing too much pollution. He also wants government to pay motorists up to the equivalent of around R60,000 to dump their diesel vehicles and buy something a little cleaner. Khan called on motorists to cut their car engines if stationary for more than a minute while last month he issued the first ever high alert. With a national health service under pressure and a third runway planned for Heathrow, the debate over London s air is likely to intensify.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
