Previous studies have shown that people living with HIV are two times more likely to experience a heart attack than those who are not living with the virus. JOHANNESBURG Researchers have begun enrolling South Africans in a clinical trial to see whether a Statin drug can reduce the risk of major heart diseases in people living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).The trial to prevent vascular events in HIV is the first large-scale random clinical research across four continents. Researchers say early data has shown that the Statins may provide protective benefits.Previous studies have shown that people living with HIV are two times more likely to experience a heart attack than those who are not living with the virus.The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Carl Dieffenbach says the study will focus on patients between the ages of 40 and 75. What we are doing is identifying patients that would not normally qualify for Statin but have HIV. Researchers will choose volunteers randomly to receive a daily dose of a placebo while continuing with their anti-retroviral treatment.&quot;(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
