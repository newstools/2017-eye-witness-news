CAPE TOWN Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has urged the public to assist authorities in protecting paramedics and report criminals who attack emergency services staff.The provincial government has launched Operation Khuseleka, an initiative aimed at providing additional safety equipment and counselling to ambulance crews.More than 200 attacks on EMS staff in the province have been reported since 2012. On average, the Western Cape Health Department sees at least five attacks per month.Zille says this is unacceptable. We have designated 10 red zones in our city where EMS staff will enter only with a police escort. We appeal to communities to work with us to protect our staff so that we can focus on saving lives.
