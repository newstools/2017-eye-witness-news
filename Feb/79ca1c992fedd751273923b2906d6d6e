The proposed plan would see aid money being diverted from projects described as questionable in developing countries. PRETORIA Some senior British ministers want to divert aid from what they see as wasteful projects in Africa and Asia to allies in eastern Europe, in a bid to get a better Brexit deal.The Independent is reporting that the controversial proposal has already started a war between ministers and officials at the Department for International Development. Downing Street officials and senior cabinet ministers believe part of the British government s R200 billion aid budget should be used to win support for a favourable deal from Brussels. The proposed plan would see aid money being diverted from projects described as questionable in developing countries in Asia and Africa to Poland, Hungary and the Baltic states, which so far have been allies of the United Kingdom. The manoeuvre is reportedly designed to persuade eastern European countries to back the demands of the UK, when negotiating its exit from the EU. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
