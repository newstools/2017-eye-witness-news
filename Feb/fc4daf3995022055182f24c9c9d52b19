The regional leadership says the former Eskom CEO is a victim of a deliberate targeting of black intellectuals by capitalists. JOHANNESBURG The North West African National Congress (ANC) says former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is a victim of a deliberate targeting of black intellectuals by capitalists. The regional leadership as well as the ANC Youth League and Women's League held a media briefing on Tuesday in Hartbeespoort to affirm their support for Molefe as a Member of Parliament (MP).This follows claims that Molefe s appointment is an attempt to parachute him into the National Assembly with some regional leaders claiming he is not a member of the North West ANC.However, in Tuesday s briefing members of the North West ANC insisted Molefe has been a member of Ward 29 since 2011.Madibeng Mayor Jostine Mothibe and the regional ANCYL s Papi Ratele says all those who say Molefe is not a member of the municipality are misinformed. He's warned that Molefe s implication in the Public Protector s State of Capture report is part of a ploy targeting black professionals to paint them as corrupt. We re warning the intellectuals of this country to say what s happening to Brian, is coming to you. These capitalists are targeting the black people who are doing well, so that at the end of the day we re been seeing or being portrayed as thugs. However, the Gauteng ANC has called its own media briefing on Wednesday, also claiming Molefe has membership in its province, calling Tuesday s briefing by the North West leadership fake.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
