The human rights lawyer and former High Court judge passed away at the weekend after a long illness. JOHANNESBURG - Western Cape High Court Judge Siraj Desai has described the late Judge Essa Moosa as a soft-natured man who opened his door to everyone.The human rights lawyer and former High Court judge passed away at the weekend at the age of 81 after a long illness. Desai says he and Moosa shared many moments together as their chambers were adjacent to each other. One of the most memorable things for me was the day he walked into my chambers really upset. I asked him what s wrong and he said he had to give judgment against the poor. He was very upset that he had to make a judgment that would affect a poor community. Parliament's police portfolio committee has also remembered the late judge, describing him as a South African of great integrity who dedicated his life to human rights. The committee says it had regular interactions with Moosa as he was responsible for the complaints mechanisms at the Hawks. Committee members will commemorate his contribution on Wednesday.
