The City of Cape Town's Stuart Diamond says R27 million has been set aside for facelift. While some might feel that the cost is excessive, we need to bare in mind that this building has immense heritage values and is 111 years old. Its maintenance has to be done with utmost care to reserve its integrity as a heritage building. #CTCityHall The iconic City Hall has been earmarked for a series of upgrades to take place over the next 3 years.
