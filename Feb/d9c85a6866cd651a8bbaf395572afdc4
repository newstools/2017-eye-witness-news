A statement purportedly from the ANC&#8217;s Bazooka Mpetsheni branch was widely circulated on social media on Tuesday. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress' (ANC) West Rand branch has condemned what it says is a fake advisory about a media briefing to clarify Brian Molefe s membership.A statement purportedly from the ANC s Bazooka Mpetsheni branch was widely circulated on social media on Tuesday after the ANC in the North West held a briefing to clarify that Molefe is a member of ward 29 in Hartbeespoort Dam.The ANC in the West Rand says this is an attempt to tarnish its name.Earlier, the North West ANC said Molefe is a victim of capitalists targeting black people who are doing well.This follows claims from the SACP and some members of the North West ANC that Molefe was not a member in ward 29 in Hartbeespoort Dam as stated by the mother body.The North West ANC leadership says it was their decision to nominate Molefe as an MP and the decision was not imposed on them as reported.PEC member and the ANC Youth League s Papi Ratele says Molefe cannot be judged on the Public Protector s report, which implicated him as having a relationship with the controversial Gupta family. Capitalists are targeting the black people who are doing well, so that at the end of the day we are seen or are being portrayed as thugs, looters [who are] corrupt as ever. The North West leadership claims Molefe has been a member in ward 29 since 2011
