Minister Angie Motshekga and Gauteng MEC Panyaza Lesufi embarked on a school road show in Midrand on Monday, promoting their reading campaign.Motshekga visited the Ponelopele Oracle School which celebrated its ten year anniversary in a private-public partnership.The minister has encouraged learners to read and spoke frankly about bullying. Don t bully anybody and think you re smart. If you bully, you should know that you re evil and you re preparing yourself for prison, because those who are in prison didn t start off at the age of 18, they started as small kids and became silly. At the same time, Lesufi says his department is facing far too many cases of bullying and it s become a serious concern. Motshekga says adults should also get into the habit of reading to set a good example for children.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
