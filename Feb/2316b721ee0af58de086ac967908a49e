Parliament&#8217;s press gallery association has been informed that journalists would be corralled in a designated 'media square'. CAPE TOWN - Deputy National Assembly Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli has undertaken to investigate and report back on journalists concerns that their freedom of movement at Parliament will be restricted during President Jacob Zuma s State of the Nation Address.Zuma will address a joint sitting of Parliament at 7pm on Thursday night, amid tight security.Parliament s press gallery association has been informed that journalists would be corralled in a designated media square in the precinct ahead of Zuma s speech and that they would not be allowed to move to another area without an escort.Tsenoli was questioned about the decision during a briefing at Parliament on Tuesday afternoon.Journalists asked Tsenoli for a written assurance that they d be free to move around Parliament s precinct as usual on Thursday. There will be no restrictions for media to do their work around Parliament - and I assume that the status quo remains - I don t know where the idea of a media square comes from. An official communication to members and staff last month, however, says media will be restricted to a media square and designated areas.Tsenoli defended broader security arrangements as a response to heightened protests over the past two and a half years. Ask anybody who plans any major event, you prepare for responses that are adequate to what might happen. But nothing in what we are planning is intended to restrict the movement of journalists here. Parliament s press gallery association is to meet with officials on Wednesday morning.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
