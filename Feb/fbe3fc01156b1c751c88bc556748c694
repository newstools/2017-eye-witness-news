The ANC has commended Qedani Mahlangu for resigning after 94 people died when they were removed from the care of the Life Esidimeni centre. JOHANNESBURG The Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) says it is commending former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu for resigning after 94 people died when they were removed from the care of the Life Esidimeni centre, but that she must now also report to the provincial party's integrity committee to explain what happened.Mahlangu resigned last week after Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba said her department had allowed the 94 psychiatric patients to die, because they hadn't been cared for properly when moved into the care of non-governmental organisations.The party s provincial secretary Hope Papo says Qedani Mahlangu must now explain what happened to their integrity commission. She was our deployee. She must explain to the commission what happened on the matter, and we will get a report from the integrity commission. But he says that doesn't mean they suspect any corruption occurred and the integrity commission deals with many difficult issues. It deals with whole range of issues ethical and integrity issues. The Gauteng ANC also says people must deal with this issue in a manner that respects the suffering of the families of those who died.At the same time, Papo says they have now rebuked the Gauteng ANC Youth League, and instructed them to say sorry in public. They have to publically retract their call they made for the resignation of Premier David Makhura, as he is not going to resign. But he doesn't believe this was part of a calculated political attack on Makhura and the former MEC. From time to time people make mistakes we have always taken an attitude not to argue with our leagues in the media. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
