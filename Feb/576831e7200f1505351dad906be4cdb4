Residents are calling for removal of foreign nationals from the area, saying they are responsible for drugs and trafficking. JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Community Safety Department has strongly condemned acts of violence by residents of Pretoria West after they went on a rampage on Saturday morning, destroying properties belonging to alleged drug dealers. Police say they are currently monitoring the chaos in the area, saying the scenes are similar to those witnessed in Rosettenville in the south of Johannesburg earlier this week. Community members are calling for the removal of foreign nationals from the area, who they say are responsible for drug and human trafficking.The department says so far two properties belonging to foreign nationals have been burned. The department s Ndivhuwo Gadisi said, The constitutional right for members of the community is to organise themselves and engage in a people s protests but once that right is violated by burning and vandalising of property, it becomes a crime. Meanwhile, the Reclaim Our Community movement in Rosettenville says it has suspended protest operations to allow room for talks to happen with various stakeholders in order to plan a way forward in dealing with the scourge of drug houses and brothels which have mushroomed in the area. The forum says the problems in Rosettenville include property hijacking, drug abuse and prostitution. Last week saw violent clashes when residents took the law into their own hands, torching at least 12 houses which are claimed to be drug dens and brothels. Reclaim Our Community says they don t condone the destruction of property but insist police need to respond more swiftly when they receive calls from residents. The forum s Simphiwe Hlafa said, Foreign nationals, particularly Nigerians, evict occupants of those houses and then convert them into brothels in Rosettenville.
