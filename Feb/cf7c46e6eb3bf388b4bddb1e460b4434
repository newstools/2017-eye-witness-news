The seats in the George Municipality became vacant following the death of councillors from the two parties last year. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) and African National Congress (ANC) are hoping to hold on to their wards in the George area as they go head-to-head in the first by-elections since the local government polls.The seats in the George Municipality became vacant following the death of councillors from the two parties last year.While the ANC had roped in deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to campaign earlier this week, the DA's former provincial leader Patricia de Lille visited the area on Tuesday.ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs says the party will keep its Uniondale ward. We won Uniondale last time around and so we are hopeful that we will consolidate there and also make inroads in this ward in George. The DA's Anneke Scheepers is buoyed by the fact the party took the Thembalethu ward last August. It is a traditional ANC stronghold so there s going to be a lot of contestation. We want to encourage all DA supporters to affirm that endorsement for the party.
