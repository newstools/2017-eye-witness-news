Earlier this month, Paul O'Sullivan accused top cop Khomotso Phahlane of engaging in dirty tactics in order to derail the corruption investigation against him. JOHANNESBURG - Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane says he is not keeping himself busy with claims by private forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan that he is being intimidated. Earlier this month, O'Sullivan accused Phahlane of engaging in dirty tactics in order to derail the corruption investigation against him. Police arrested O'Sullivan on four criminal charges including extortion, kidnapping and fraud. He has since opened a case against the South African Police Service.Phalane insists O'Sullivan is not above the law and says the accusations of intimidation are unfortunate . It s unfortunate that this perception is being created. I thought one of the reasons I agreed to be investigated is that all of us are equal in front of the law of our country. To me, it doesn t matter whether it is Phahlane or O Sullivan, if he has committed a crime then he must be investigated. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
