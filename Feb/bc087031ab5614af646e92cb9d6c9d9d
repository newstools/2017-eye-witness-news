The movement says it's unhappy with the scrapping of the Jozi@Work programme which it says will leave 8,000 people without work. JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg Social Movement says the city s Mayor Herman Mashaba must step down because of the many decisions he s making without consulting residents in the process. The movement which consists of a number of NGOs, businesses and co-operative forums, says they are unhappy with the scrapping of the Jozi@Work programme which they say will leave 8,000 people without work. The forum held a meeting on Sunday and was attended by Jozi@Work employees and community coordinators and are planning to hold a march on 23 February. The movement s Tshepang Mokgatla says they have requested to see the mayor. Before they cut programmes, they ll come with a proper alternative and so we re saying the antagonistic posture is actually losing what being a mayor is.
