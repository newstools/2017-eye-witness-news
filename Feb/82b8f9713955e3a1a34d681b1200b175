JOHANNESBURG - Foreigners staying in Pretoria West have told Eyewitness News that weekend violence in the area has left them traumatised and afraid.Local community members from Pretoria West on Saturday stormed several properties which they claimed were facilitating prostitution and the drugs trade.Most of the houses were owned or occupied by foreigners and some are questioning the motives behind the search.One Zimbabwean woman, who asked to remain anonymous, says crackdowns on drugs and prostitution dens in the area are a good idea but in the weekend search, innocent people s homes were looted and vandalised. The initiative about what the community was doing was okay if they didn t burn houses and beat people. There is drug dealing and prostitution and we need to curb that but the way they did that s very wrong. On Monday, the area remains calm and police continue to patrol the streets here.Several foreigners can be seen busy fixing the houses they live in after they were damaged during the community operation.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
