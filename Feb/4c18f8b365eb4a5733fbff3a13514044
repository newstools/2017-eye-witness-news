The committee says it will not consider the document until someone at the SABC owns up to writing it. CAPE TOWN - Parliament s ad hoc committee probing the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board s fitness to hold office has slammed an unsigned report from the public broadcaster in response to its interim report.The committee says it will not consider the document until someone at the SABC owns up to writing it. The SABC did not give testimony before the committee.On Tuesday, the inquiry heard the SABC s former chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng stated that he felt prejudiced because he was not called to testify.Parliament s legal advisor Anthea Gordon says the SABC s response to the inquiry s interim report is vast, damning and largely dismissive of the inquiry.Gordon says the unsigned document was sent from the email of acting chief executive James Aguma.Both the submissions from the SABC and Communications Minister Faith Muthambi have been marked confidential but Gordon says this holds no standing at the inquiry, which is a public process.Chairperson of the committee Vincent Smith has agreed to wait for a response from the SABC on the author of the report, before considering it. Like all other reports, if it s new evidence, we won t look at it until there s a response to our letter. MPs say the SABC must respect those who gave testimony under oath if it wants its views to be considered by the committee.(Edited by
