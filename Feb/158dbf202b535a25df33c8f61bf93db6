EFF leader Julius Malema had asked the House to agree to set up a committee to look into possible amendments that would allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. CAPE TOWN - A motion by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) for a review of Constitutional provisions on land expropriation has failed in the National Assembly.EFF leader Julius Malema had asked the House to agree to set up a committee to look into possible amendments that would allow for the expropriation of land without compensation.But the ANC and most other opposition parties agreed that expropriation without compensation could not be contemplated.EFF leader Julius Malema proposed that the National Assembly establish an ad hoc, multi-party committee to investigate land expropriation in the public interest without compensation.He called for widespread public participation and wanted the committee to report back to the House by October.&quot;This property clause makes it practically impossible for those dispossessed of their land to obtain justice for injustices perpetrated against them.&quot;But his motion did not enjoy support from either the ruling party or the opposition.The ANC s Phumuzile Ngwenya-Mabila: &quot;Expropriation without compensation is illegal. The motion must fall.&quot;The ACDP s Kenneth Meshoe said expropriation without compensation would lead to land invasion.Malema said radical economic transformation was merely ANC rhetoric and hot air from President Jacob Zuma.(Edited by Zunaid Ismael)
