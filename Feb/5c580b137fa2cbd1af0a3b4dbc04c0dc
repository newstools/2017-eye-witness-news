The ANC&#8217;s Zizi Kodwa says ANCYL leader Collen Maine has no business making comments about Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan being a spy. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says ANC Youth League leader Collen Maine was wrong, reckless and irresponsible to claim that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is an impimpi or a spy.Maine made the comments over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal where he also said Gordhan must be dealt with as the party dealt with spies during apartheid.He s previously supported the Gupta family amid speculation they would benefit if new Member of Parliament Brian Molefe was appointed to Cabinet.The ANC s Zizi Kodwa says Maine has no business making these comments. Only the president must be allowed to deal with issues of appointment or to fire ministers. Any structure outside that, within that structure is part of the ANC, we think those particular statements are incorrect and inappropriate. And he won t be drawn on why he thinks Maine may have said them in the first place. I can t preempt why people say incorrect statements in public but I think the first statement, there can never be excuse or justification. Maine has previously defended the Gupta family and attacked people thought to be working against them.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
