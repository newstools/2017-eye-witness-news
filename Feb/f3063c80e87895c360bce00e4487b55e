At the announcement of an early conference, some members of the veterans association disrupted the press briefing. JOHANNESBURG The Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) and disgruntled former members have agreed to hold the MKMVA's elective conference earlier than initially planned, saying they want to unite the organisation.While the two groups presented a united front at a briefing at Luthuli House earlier on Monday, divisions between them were still visible.Some veterans, under the banner of the MK National Council, have previously questioned the legitimacy of the leadership of the MKMVA.However, the veterans association has accused the group of trying to undo the leadership of the structure and sow divisions. While the MKMVA and the MK National Council have announced a collective decision to hold an elective conference soon, it seems some members of the veterans association are against the idea of the conference.One man, who was removed from the building, shouted: They never did anything for us, so today they are not taking us to a special conference. #MKMVA The man is removed from the briefing...WATCH pic.twitter.com/F8VxGktiU3MKMVA chair Kebby Maphatsoe says a joint conference preparatory team will be established to work towards uniting all former MK members. That is why you see this collective here today, it tells you that we are working together. That is why we have brought the MKMVA conference forward, so that we move as a united force. However, he made it clear that the veterans association which the umMkhonto We Sizwe national council urged to suspend its activities, continues to exist as a constitutional structure that will implement is own resolutions until the conference.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
