Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has assured MPs that over 17 million beneficiaries will receive grants on 1 April. CAPE TOWN - Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini says her department is working with Treasury to ensure Sassa is able to pay out social grants in April.Dlamini has assured members of Parliament's portfolio committee on social development that the over 17 million beneficiaries will receive grants, despite Cash Paymaster Services (CPS)'s contract running out next month.Sassa is yet to approach the Constitutional Court to allow the extension of the contract.Dlamini says they will soon begin talks with CPS about an extension. What we want to do is to ensure that that contract is not taken as is because we do have some disadvantages with this other contract, firstly, the deductions from the grant recipients. IFP MP Liezl van der Merwe says she does not understand why the department waited so long to implement a 2014 Constitutional Court ruling. By your own admission and your opening remarks, you say you only started working on the work streams and engaging with Treasury, doing due diligence on CPS and looking at the state of readiness of Sassa in October, so now we are forced into a crisis.
