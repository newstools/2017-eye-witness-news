JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says a minimum wage which government plans to introduce a minimum wage next year is not intended to be a living wage.He has announced that a minimum wage of R20 an hour is expected to be implemented by May next year.It will ensure that workers earn at least R3500 per month for a 40-hour work week.But he says for now it will exclude certain categories of workers like farm and domestic workers who are covered by sectoral determinations.He says added to this, the process will be monitored. This minimum wage will be overseen by a national minimum wage commission which will be established to recommend annual adjustments to the level of this wage. Meanwhile Ramaphosa says critics should not read too much into Cosatu missing Tuesday's signing ceremony after the federation requested more time to report back to its central executive committee. Cosatu s failure to sign was based on a deep understanding of the processes that they need to go through. So it was not embarrassing on us and it was something that we all understood.
