Satawu says it welcomes Brian Molefe's swearing in while Save South Africa calls on the public to reject and protest against it. JOHANNESBURG The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) has welcomed the swearing in of former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe as a Member of Parliament, as has the Black Business Council.Molefe was officially sworn in on Thursday morning.Just four months ago he left Eskom under a cloud after being implicated in the Public Protector s State of Capture report.Satawu general secretary Zenzo Mahlangu said: We welcome his appointment for a number of reasons. We re talking about someone we know and have worked with for quite a long time when he was in Transnet and we have looked at his record. We think Parliament needs people of his caliber. But civil society organisation Save South Africa has called on the public to reject and protest against the appointment of Molefe to Parliament.Spokesperson Lawson Naidoo said, It is no overstatement to say that Molefe's appointment marks a potential turning point for the state capture process and must be stopped.
