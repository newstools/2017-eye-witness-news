CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Environmental Affairs MEC Anton Bredell says desalination is one of the last options government is considering in tackling the on-going water crisis in the province.A group of demonstrators who gathered outside a briefing to be given by Bredell have called for better options than desalination.Earlier this week, the government announced dam levels had dropped to below 35%, placing the province in a precarious position with several months to go before the winter rainfall season.About twenty demonstrators made their voices heard ahead of MEC Bredell s briefing at the Cape Town Press Club.#WCWater Demonstrators are picketing ahead of Bredell&#39;s briefing calling for other options to be considered. @MoniqueMortlock pic.twitter.com/yMtMox3gcLMost were from the Philippi Horticulture Area Food and Farming campaign, which is against the development of the farming area in Philippi, the largest producer of Cape Town s fresh produce. They are opposed to the option of desalination to deal with the severe water shortage.The campaign's Nazeer Sonday says: We want to ask Bredell why he s talking about desalination, where all he should be doing is saving the aquifer and the water resources that we already have. Sonday says the Philippi Horticulture Area is the only part of the Cape Flats Aquifer that has not been developed yet. The aquifer is an underground water system located mainly underneath the Cape Flats.#WCWater Bredell speaking now: &quot;Last year at the same time dam levels were at 45%.&quot; This year its at below 35%.
