The High Court in PTA has ruled govt's decision to give notice to withdraw from the ICC was unconstitutional and invalid. PRETORIA - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will oppose any attempt by government to appeal the court s finding that the notice to withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC) submitted to the United Nations is unconstitutional and invalid. The DA brought the application in December following government s decision to withdraw from the Rome Statute, claiming it undermined South Africa s obligations to international relations. Cabinet unilaterally made the decision in response to an earlier ruling which found South Africa was obliged to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he attended the African Union summit in Johannesburg. While suggesting that South Africa still intends to withdraw from the ICC, Justice Minister Michael Masutha says it s not clear which process government will follow. We will have to decide whether we ll appeal the decision which could further delay the process. We will act accordingly and re-approach Parliament. The DA s James Selfe wants the matter debated in Parliament. &quot;We really hope government won t waste more taxpayers money on litigation. If government appeals then we will oppose the appeal.&quot;The centre for Human Rights and Legal Resource Centre both say a broad consultative process should be followed.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
