Sadiq Khan used the Oscars to send a powerful message to the US president following a clampdown on travel &amp; immigration. LONDON - London Mayor Sadiq Khan has used the Oscars to send a powerful message to Donald Trump following a clampdown on travel and immigration in America. Khan hosted a free public viewing of The Salesman in Trafalgar Square, a film by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, who was banned from the US because of his nationality. The premier of the Oscar-nominated movie was attended by thousands and saw Blur front man Damon Albarn play with musicians from a Syrian orchestra. To recover from a microphone glitch, Khan told the crowd that Trump would not silence him. At a time when people want to have travel bans, we should talk about welcoming people. At a time when people want to build walls, we should build bridges. Anti-Trump protests have been held in London as government prepares to welcome him on a state visit.
