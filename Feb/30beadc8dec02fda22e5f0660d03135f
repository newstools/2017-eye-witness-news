Eskom says a 2011 report found Koos Jordaan&#8217;s conduct should be investigated after his involvement in R10 billion worth of contracts. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says both the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) probed claims that the man in charge of buying coal during the 2008 load shedding crisis had awarded contracts to a company owned by a friend, that was then deemed irregular. It was reported on Wednesday morning that a report compiled by accountancy firm Deloitte found in 2011 that Koos Jordaan s conduct should be investigated after he was involved in awarding contracts worth R10 billion. But Jordaan had resigned as soon as a formal investigation into his conduct was started and now says he did nothing wrong while dealing with those contracts. Eskom says the NPA and the SIU investigated Jordaan and handed over a report to the Presidency.The utility s Khulu Phasiwe says they did take this situation seriously and they do act against corruption. In terms of this investigation and others we have done before, it has been discovered that there are some rotten elements within Eskom and obviously the law has to take care of them. Last week, the Financial Mail magazine reported on a different report that suggested people at Eskom may have been manipulating prices and contracts to make money for themselves rather than to help the utility buy the coal it needed at the best possible price.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
