Eskom's Ben Ngubane says it implemented more than 70% of Dentons&#8217; recommendations which helped them to turn the parastatal around. JOHANNESBURG Eskom says a R20 million investigation by a law firm into its state of affairs was not considered useless nor incomplete, as it has already implemented 13 of the recommendations.Dentons was asked to probe the cause of an electricity blackout in 2008 with daily loadshedding, which cost the economy billions of rand.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown is on the record as saying that the report is &quot;useless&quot; as Eskom terminated the probe before the final report could be commissioned. Eskom chairperson Ben Ngubane says before stopping the investigation, the preliminary report already proposed findings which had to be implemented urgently as the situation was dire, and waiting for a final report would have wasted money and time. He says Eskom has already implemented more than 70% of Dentons recommendations which helped them to turn the parastatal around. What more do you want? We can t eat the elephant in one piece, but the part of the elephant that we had was complete for our purposes to turn around a dire situation. It s being reported that Eskom has sanitised the report, suggesting that it s trying to hide information.However, Ngubane has denied this.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
