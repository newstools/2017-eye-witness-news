JOHANNESBURG Newly appointed Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa says she doesn t think she'll ever understand how officials breached the Constitution and infringed on so many human rights when moving mentally-ill patients from Life Healthcare Esidimeni. At least 100 psychiatric patients died after being transferred to 27 NGOs across the province which were later found to be operating unlawfully. #GPhealth MEC Gwen Ramokgopa about briefing media in terms of #Esidimeni recommendations. She is with Acting HOD Ernest Kenosi. MR pic.twitter.com/06pCsAbWmdRamokgopa was appointed on the same day the Health Ombudsman released his damning findings into the circumstances surrounding the deaths. Former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu resigned the night before the report was made public. Wednesday was Ramokgopa s first press conference since being sworn in as MEC late last month. She says every single person involved in the Esidimeni tragedy failed the affected families and South Africans at large. I must say that I still do not fully comprehend how it was possible that the Constitution of our country, the National Health Act, the National Mental Health Act, the Health Professions Council, the South African Nursing Act, the Public Service Act, as well as a plethora of policies and interventions all failed the most vulnerable amongst us as a society, despite the voices and protests by the families. Ramokgopa says she and her team will be working tirelessly to restore public confidence in the public healthcare system. (Edited by Tamsin Wort)
