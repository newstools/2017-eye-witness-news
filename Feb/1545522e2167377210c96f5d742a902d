The actual increase year-on-year was far from the 13% claimed by Zuma but in actual fact only around 2%. JOHANNESBURG - An Eyewitness News Africa Check fact-check-a-thon has found that President Jacob Zuma s claim that tourist arrival numbers for 2016 had increased by 13% was exaggerated. The president gave the facts during his State of the Nation Address (Sona) in Parliament on Thursday night.Zuma was right to claim that the total number of tourists who arrived on our shores between January and November last year adds up to around nine million. We are thus pleased that our tourist arrival numbers for the period January to November 2016 increased to nine million, an increase of just over one million from 2015. But Statistics South Africa, which records the monthly tourist arrivals in South Africa, says a total of 8,903,773 visitors came to South Africa in 2015.That means that the actual increase year-on-year was far from the 13% claimed by Zuma.The rise was in actual fact only around 2%.[WATCH] #Sona2017 President Zuma's 5 main points(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
