It's reported managers earning between R1m and R2.8m were awarded study bursaries, compromising applications of junior members. CAPE TOWN Parliament s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo has denied reports of bursaries being awarded to senior staff members.According to Sunday newspaper reports, the institution flouted criteria over an allocated bursary budget in favour of Secretary Gengezi Mgidlana and Information Technology chief Unathi Mtya.According to the reports senior managers earning between R1 million and R2.8 million had been awarded study bursaries, compromising the applications of junior staff members.A parliamentary official says Mgidlani had already been pursuing a Master of Business Leadership degree at Unisa when he was appointed to his current position.Mothapo says the same applies to Mtya. We only have two managers who are benefiting and it is because of their previous employment. When they were employed by Parliament from their previous employers, they were already studying and already benefitting bursaries under their previous employment. Mothapo adds 98% of the parliamentary bursary fund is awarded to ordinary staff members.
