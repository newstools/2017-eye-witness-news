The money was given to the Progressive Professionals Forum in exchange for seats and tables at events it hosted. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says that Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has now revealed that Eskom and Transnet have given the Progressive Professionals (PPF) Forum led by Mzwanele Manyi R840,000 in sponsorships.Manyi and the forum have been supporting the Gupta family and strongly criticising Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.In her written reply to these questions, Brown says that the PPF received R440,000 from Eskom and R400,000 from Transnet. The money was given to the forum in exchange for seats and tables at events it hosted.The DA's David Maynier asked the parliamentary questions that led to this answer.&quot;Brian Molefe, who headed up Eskom at the time the sponsorships were made, was effectively funding an organistaion that was waging a dirty war on the Minister of Finance and National Treasury.&quot;Last week, Manyi said that Pravin Gordhan's budget was not radical enough, while he and the forum have both asked Parliament not to pass the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill.(Edited by Zunaid Ismael)
