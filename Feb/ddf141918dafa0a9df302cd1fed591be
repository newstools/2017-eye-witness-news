We received this report about two weeks ago from Ford. We are currently assessing the contents of that report.&quot;At the time of the recall, Ford CEO Jeff Nemeth said they had investigated all 39 incidents reported to them and have determined the cause of the fires. Overheating caused by lack of cooling system, this can lead to the cracking of a cylinder head and therefore an oil leak. But he maintains there've been no injuries. We understand the high level of concern, we are not aware of any injuries that have resulted from our engines.Thirty-three-year-old Reshall Jimmy died in his Kuga in December 2015 when his car caught alight but Ford says this was a unique and an unrelated incident.The attorney representing the Jimmy family, Rod Montano, says he'll be representing the 30 motorists to bring a class action against Ford.(Edited by Zunaid Ismael)
