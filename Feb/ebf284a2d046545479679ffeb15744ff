City were far more clinical and enterprising on the counter attack. Ajax could not find the net, despite their dominance of possession.City now leads the PSL on 31 points while Ajax occupies 11th place, trailing their city neighbours by 13 points.Ajax will travel up country next week to face Polokwane City, while City face off against a battered Orlando Pirates.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
