Ipid head Robert McBride says he believes the arrest of Paul O&#8217;Sullivan is linked to the corruption case against top cop Khomotso Phahlane. PRETORIA - Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride has told the police s portfolio committee that the arrest of private investigator Paul O Sullivan was an attempt to derail the investigation into acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane.McBride and a delegation from the independent watchdog body have briefed Parliament on a range of issues including high-profile cases such as the one against Phahlane as well as Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza. Police arrested O Sullivan on Monday but the High Court in Pretoria ordered his release several hours later. The private investigator is the complainant in the corruption investigation into Phahlane. Holding no punches, McBride says he believes the arrest of O Sullivan is linked to the corruption case against Phahlane. In terms of all the information before us, it is an attempt to disrupt our investigation. It s intimidation and it s in contravention of section 33 of the Ipid Act. McBride clarified O Sullivan s position in terms of Ipid. For the purposes of Ipid, O Sulluvan is a complainant, has information of a crime and is assisting us with that information. The portfolio committee says if there are further developments in this case, it should report back to Parliament.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
