Eskom gave the eight municipalities until Wednesday morning to either settle their accounts or make an arrangement for a payment plan. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it has given the eight municipalities with outstanding debt another extension to settle their accounts.Earlier this week, Eskom said that it would be disconnecting defaulting municipalities from 6am on Wednesday.The power utility gave the eight municipalities until Wednesday morning to either settle their accounts or make an arrangement to work with a payment plan.Spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says they re hopeful some provincial governments have intervened and made the payments. When we started with notifications to municipalities, essentially we had sent 40 municipalities those power interruption notices. Out of the 40, 32 have started making payments and have so far paid about R1.3 billion into Eskom s coffers. Last month, the High Court in Pretoria granted the utility permission to cut power supply to a number of municipalities in the Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Free State, North West and Mpumalanga that were in arrears.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown then instructed Eskom to give the municipalities until the end of this month to pay off their debt before switching off their lights.A number of defaulting municipalities have since paid funds into Eskom's bank account to avoid being cut off.To understand how municipal spending has had a direct impact on service delivery, including the provision of water and electricity, visit EWN s Municipal Audit Portal.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
