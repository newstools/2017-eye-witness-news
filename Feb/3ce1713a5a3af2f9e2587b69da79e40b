Bonginkosi Madikizela is the new Democratic Alliance Western Cape interim leader. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says the Democratic Alliance (DA) could lose many supporters due to the appointment of Bonginkosi Madikizela as interim provincial leader.Madikizela won 75% of the vote at the party's provincial council meeting over the weekend, beating four other candidates.He will serve in the position until the DA s provincial elective congress in August.Over the weekend, Madikizela told the media he doesn't believe a leader's skin colour affects their number of supporters.&quot;It is a myth to think that a leader of a particular colour will be able to attract more votes because of his or her race. If that was the case the Democratic Alliance, which was led by Tony Leon and Helen Zille, would not have been the second biggest party in South Africa. Madikizela says he understands the dynamics in rural areas and he's confident that the DA can find ways to address the issues in these communities.But ANC acting provincial chair Khaya Magaxa says Madikizela will be seen as an outcast in black townships, because no one knows him. Magaxa adds the DA could also lose votes with the coloured population, which makes up its main voter base in the province.&quot;By avoiding the coloured community the DA will be marginalising itself in a way from the coloured community.&quot;Madikizela plans to visit the DA's branches in all the regions in the province, especially in ANC strongholds, as part of the party's run-up to the 2019 elections.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
