JOHANNESBURG Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Ismail Vadi says he is opposed to the lawlessness shown by some taxi associations.The MEC has condemned the barricading of several streets in the Johannesburg CBD by taxi drivers on Monday afternoon.He says there has been a long-standing dispute between the two associations regarding taxi routes. Vadi says it s completely unacceptable that streets have been blocked by taxi drivers. He says the department has never closed its doors when discussing matters with the associations. They think that they can invade our offices and that we must engage with them. Certainly, I am not going to be negotiating on those terms. The Transport MEC says that the taxi associations' behaviour is unacceptable. That is what I am opposed to. We want to have a stable taxi industry, we want to see them empowered and we want to see them grow as an industry. The department says the associations were expected to submit their arguments last December but none of the parties have done so.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
