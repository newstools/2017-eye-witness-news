Provincial secretary Jacobs says the party has recognised the importance of discipline and uniting to serve their communities if it's to turnaround its misfortunes at the polls in 2019. Building a real and lasting victory around a concrete programme of action isn t only required, but is a prerequisite for such victory. Jacobs says the lekgotla was in support of banning slates and institutionalising open caucuses as part of the nomination process for top jobs. Branches must be given the right to nominate; consolidation at any other levels tampering with the authority of the branches will be dealt with. The party will hold its provincial general council and policy conference in April.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
