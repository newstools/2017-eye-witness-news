Carswell Ka Shabangu says the issues faced by the ANC need to be dealt with first before discussing who will be the new leader of the party. JOHANNESBURG - Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans say their calls to have the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) disbanded during the national consultative conference do not form part of a plan to endorse any individual to take over from President Jacob Zuma.On Wednesday, the MK steering committee gave feedback on resolutions taken during their council meeting with former soldiers and their gathering with the ANC's top six on Monday.The steering committee has called for an interim leadership to be elected for the June conference using the eye of the needle document as a guideline. We re not here to endorse any particular individual. Carswell Ka Shabangu says the issues faced by the ANC needs to be dealt with first before discussing who will be the newly elected leader of the party. We want to elect a proper leader based on the conditions that we re going to define clearly and agree upon broadly. The veterans also want all MKMVA activities to be immediately suspended in order for a roll call of former soldiers to be done and then an interim committee to be elected.New representatives of the association are expected to contribute and the national consultative conference to deal with, among other things, what they re described as weak branches currently lack political education. ANC BRANCHES LACK POLITICAL EDUCATION The MK veterans have decried how weak ANC branches are and have called for some of them to be re-launched where necessary. It says the ANC constitutions needs to be reviewed, including their membership clause, and for the ANC veteran s league to be strengthened with members appointed as political advisers to the party.Ka Shabangu says many branches now lack political education: We want strong branches. We don t want strong branches in terms of numbers, instead they must understand the politics of the country, the policies of the ANC and the strategy and tactics as to how we move society to a better future.
