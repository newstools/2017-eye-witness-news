JOHANNESBURG - Uber drivers in Gauteng say they are hoping the company will take their grievances into account especially their safety concerns.On Saturday the group had an anti-violence convoy from Marlboro to Sandton to express their dissatisfaction at the number of operators being victimised, allegedly by rival meter taxi operators.Just last week meter taxi drivers allegedly slashed the tyres and broke the windows of an Uber operator s car at the Midrand Gautrain station.Driver representative Zweli Ngwenya says they ve had enough. These guys are beating us up and it s enough. No one will beat up your fellow brother or sister and keep quiet. Ngwenya says that they have now formed a strong bond through the march. Drivers say they will continue to lobby for safe working conditions until something is done about the situation. If one of us is beaten up or a car is being smashed, those who are close need to ask why it s being done. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
