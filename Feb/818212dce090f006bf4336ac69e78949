Cosatu says President Jacob Zuma needs to reassure investors and quell fears of political uncertainty in his State of the Nation Address. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says it expects President Jacob Zuma to assure South Africans that government is not at war with itself but united when he addresses the nation this week.The president will deliver the State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday night which will set the tone for government s program for the year ahead.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa raised concerns late last year about infighting in government when Treasury and Eskom were caught up in public mud-slinging over allegations that the power utility had misrepresented information.Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla says Zuma needs to reassure investors and quell fears of political uncertainty. We expect government to send a clear statement that says government is united and that government is prepared to work with all the universal and social partners kick-start this in the economy. Meanwhile, security for this year's Sona is expected to be tighter than ever, with extended road closures and a beefed-up police presence to deal with any protest marches.The secretary to Parliament said preparations are on track for the event, which will cost an estimated R4 million.Secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana gave an assurance that cellphone signals won t be jammed and that journalists will have freedom of movement.Security for the event is a joint operation involving Parliament, the police, the State Security Agency and other departments, as well as the City of Cape Town and the provincial government. The planning that needs to happen is to make sure that we have a very good event at Parliament. So from a planning perspective, it s all systems go, said Mgidlana.But he could not confirm speculation that 6,000 extra police will be in Cape Town to deal with any protests.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
