The lawyer representing the Gupta family says claims by the SACP that the family is running a shadowy parallel state are not based on fact. JOHANNESBURG - The lawyer representing the Gupta family says claims by the South African Communist Party (SACP) that the family is running a shadowy parallel government are not based on fact.The party made the claim in the African Communist journal on Thursday. The family s lawyer also responded to Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas's legal papers, in which he says he's sticking by his claim that he met Ajay Gupta in Saxonwold, and that Gupta offered him the position of finance minister and R600 million. The Gupta family's attorney Gert van der Merwe says the SACP has made claims in their journal but has not offered any facts. I read it twice and I couldn t find one single incident of fact. He also says Ajay Gupta still believes Jonas is blatantly dishonest when he says they met in Saxonwold in October 2015. Van der Merwe also explained how it could be that Jonas met Duduzane Zuma and Fana Hlongwane at the Gupta's home, but did not meet Ajay Gupta himself. One part of the property consists of conference facilities and Mr Zuma had access to those. He says they would welcome an inquiry to get to a final finding on this issue.LISTEN: SA Communist Party takes swipe at Guptas(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
