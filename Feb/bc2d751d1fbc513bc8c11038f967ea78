China has long been concerned that instability in Afghanistan could spill over into the violence-prone Xinjiang region in China's far west. BEIJING - China's defence ministry on Thursday dismissed reports Chinese military vehicles were patrolling inside Afghanistan, saying the two countries were only carrying out counter-terrorism operations along their common border.This month, the Central Asia-Caucasus Analyst think-tank said in a report on its website that Chinese troops were on Afghan soil conducting joint patrols with their Afghan counterparts.That followed a similar report in an Indian media outlet in November.Defence ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang said Chinese public security departments had counter-terrorism cooperation along the China-Afghanistan border.&quot;This is law enforcement bodies from China and Afghanistan, in accordance with a bilateral agreement on strengthening border law enforcement, conducting cooperation along the border so as to jointly carry out counter-terrorism and to fight against cross-border crime,&quot; Ren told a monthly news briefing.&quot;Reports in foreign media of Chinese military vehicles patrolling inside Afghanistan do not accord with the facts,&quot; he added, largely repeating a similar ministry statement from November.China and Afghanistan share a 76km stretch of border in a remote, mountainous corner of central Asia.China has long been concerned that instability in Afghanistan could spill over into the violence-prone Xinjiang region in China's far west, home to the Muslim Uighur people, where hundreds of people have died in recent years in unrest blamed by China on Islamist militants.
