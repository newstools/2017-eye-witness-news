There were 137 demonstrations nationwide last year compared to 164 in 2015. CAPE TOWN Service delivery protests against municipalities across the country are at a three-year low.This is according to local government data firm Municipal IQ which has released statistics for protests in 2016.There were 137 demonstrations nationwide last year compared to 164 in 2015. The previous year had 191 protests against municipalities.Municipal IQ's Karen Heese says 2016 was an up and down year. On the one hand we had quite a lot of service delivery strikes and it ended quite weakly. The positive is that it seems people took to the ballot rather than the streets. Heese adds this year has started off smoothly. Communities seem patient and hopefully this shows their councillors are communicating with them. The figures only include protests in which residents complained about a lack services and excludes those against the nomination of councillors ahead of last year's local government elections.
