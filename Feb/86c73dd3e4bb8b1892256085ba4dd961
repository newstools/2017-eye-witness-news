JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) has called on former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela to be charged after her son was involved in an accident with an official vehicle.The accident occurred in 2012 when she was still in office.Madonsela has however since agreed to pay back the sum of R470,000 to settle the matter.Madonsela said her decision to pay, which she describes as a peace offering, is informed by her moral compass and ethical considerations.The advocate says she hopes this will settle the matter and allow her to continue with her new chapter as a human rights activist.The Thuli Madonsela Foundation s Catherine Peter says the funds have already been deducted because the former Public Protector would like to move forward.The ANCWL says Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane must consider laying a charge of defeating the ends of justice against her predecessor Madonsela.#ThuliMadonsela ANCWL calls for former PP to be charged with defeating the ends of justice.

Matuba says Mkhwebane must also investigate the circumstances under which Madonsela's son used the state vehicle. Whether Madonsela gave her son permission to drive the car. The ANCWL says while it welcomes Madonsela's apology, she must be held accountable if the correct procedures were not followed in this matter.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
