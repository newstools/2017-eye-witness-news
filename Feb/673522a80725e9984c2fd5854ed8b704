MKMVA chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe says he was only there to hear Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma&#8217;s speech on women in leadership. JOHANNESBURG - Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans chair Kebby Maphatsoe has defended attending a church service on Sunday where the African National Congress Women s League (ANCWL) campaigned for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, saying he respects the decision by the ANC to put a lid on the succession debate.Dlamini-Zuma addressed the congregation at the Faith Gospel Ministries church in Khutsong on Sunday under the theme &quot;Women in Leadership&quot;, telling the congregation there is a need for women to be elected as presidents in Africa.The MKMVA chair and government Minister Des Van Rooyen joined a group of ANCWL members at the church lead by its president Bathabile Dlamini.While Dlamini was singing Dlamini-Zuma s praises when introducing her, they were not allowed to campaign.But she continued to say the league will campaign for this honest leader .Maphatsoe says he was only there to hear Dlamini-Zuma s speech on women in leadership. It was not organised by the ANCWL, it was organised by the church and so the church invited comrade Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. He, who has previously indicated that the veterans association will support the ANCWL s decision to support a woman president, says his organisation will pronounce its candidate after the ANC opens the succession debate.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
