Robert McBride says Ipid has a history of being underfunded and this was noted by the Farlam Commission into the Marikana tragedy. CAPE TOWN - Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride says the police watchdog cannot have full autonomy with a lack of funding. Ipid officials have briefed Parliament s police committee on budgetary constraints and disciplinary action against officials arising from the Auditor-General s report.McBride says Ipid has a history of being underfunded and this was noted by the Farlam Commission of Inquiry into the Marikana tragedy. The Farlam Commission also makes recommendations relating to our independence and non-reliance on SAPS for key investigative capacity. That is unlikely to be fulfilled if we continue to be underfunded. McBride adds that funding is needed to implement Ipid s expansion strategy. The expansion plan approximated the envisagedinstitutional structure composition of Ipid. I think the total amount was about R400mand the amount from inception was R535m. So there was still a hundred off. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
