The official opposition says government should be looking to boost economic growth, selling unnecessary assets and cut spending further. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) says there are alternatives to tax increases to plug a R28 billion fiscal hole in the new budget.The official opposition says government should be looking to boost economic growth, selling unnecessary assets and cut spending further.It says Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has to re-prioritise expenditure to fund programmes for millions of unemployed youths.Rather than raise taxes, the DA says a 1%increase in gross domestic product could raise R18,2 billion in additional revenue.It's praised former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene for selling government's stake in Vodacom but has noted that government has since abandoned the shedding of assets through which the DA says substantial revenue can be raised.The party's David Maynier says it wants to see government do more to cut spending and eliminate waste, including costs on foreign missions, foreign aid, the public service and provincial legislatures. Cost containment measures are important and they do send the right fiscal message but they are largely fiscal spin because they target a small proportion of total government expenditure. The DA wants to see Treasury institute a more comprehensive spending review both at programme level and in terms of strategy.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
