Social activist Yusuf Abramjee says the 22-year-old man and his brother may have been working with an armed group. JOHANNESBURG Questions have been raised about what a South African man was doing in Syria when he was found dead, apparently in the capital of Damascus. Details surrounding the Durban man s death are still unclear. Social activist Yusuf Abramjee says the 22-year-old man and his brother may have been working with an armed group, although the exact organisation is not yet known. Abramjee says the family will issue a statement this week but it s not yet clear if the family has contacted the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco). Especially when a South African citizen is killed abroad, I think it s important that the family get in touch with Dirco. And the family have asked for privacy during this time but I m sure they will have something to say in coming days.
