Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni scotched rumours of a possible last-minute invite. ROME - Russian President Vladimir Putin has not been invited to this year s Group of Seven summit of world leaders, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday, scotching rumours of a possible last-minute invite. To be clear, the Italian G7 presidency has not sent any invitation to Putin to participate at the G7 in Taormina, Gentiloni said, referring to a summit scheduled for May in Sicily of the leaders of major Western industrialised leaders. At this moment in time, (an invitation for Russia) doesn t seem to me to be at all realistic, Gentiloni said during a news conference with his British counterpart Theresa May. He added that it was important to continue dialogue with Moscow.
