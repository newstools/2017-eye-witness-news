Niroshan Dickwella has reportedly been banned for two limited-over matches after his latest breach of ICC code of conduct. BENGALURU - Sri Lanka opener Niroshan Dickwella has been banned for two limited-over matches after his latest breach of ICC code of conduct, the International Cricket Council said on Tuesday.Dickwella was found guilty of showing dissent at an umpire s decision during the second Twenty20 International against Australia in Geelong on Sunday, for which he received two demerit points and was fined 30% of his match fee.If a player accumulates four to seven demerit points within a two-year period they are converted into two suspension points, which brings a ban for one Test or two one-day internationals or Twenty20s.Dickwella was given a 50% fine and three demerit points in the fourth ODI against South Africa in Cape Town on 8 February and the two additional demerits means he has exceeded the threshold of four demerits in a two-year period.The 23-year-old will accordingly miss the third Twenty20 International against Australia in Adelaide on 22 February, and Sri Lanka s first ODI against Bangladesh on 25 March, the ICC said.Dickwella was adjudged to have shown dissent when he kicked the turf and looked at his shoulder for a prolonged period of time after pausing to view the replay following his dismissal in Geelong, the ICC added.Australia wicketkeeper Tim Paine was also fined 15% of his match fee and given one demerit point for a related incident in the same game.Paine was found guilty of using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batsman upon his/her dismissal during an International Match, the ICC added.Sri Lanka have already wrapped up the ongoing series Down Under after winning the first two Twenty20 Internationals.
