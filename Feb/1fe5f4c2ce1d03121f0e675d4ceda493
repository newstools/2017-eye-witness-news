Sicelo Xulu took special leave pending the finalisation of the forensic investigation into corruption involving the city&#8217;s R1bn smart electricity meter tender. JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says he is not satisfied with the way corruption allegations against City Power Managing Director Sicelo Xulu have been handled. Xulu took special leave on Thursday pending the finalisation of the forensic investigation into corruption involving the city s R1 billion smart electricity meter tender.This comes after Mashaba said he was getting legal advice on how to deal with the power utility's board, which he believes failed to suspend Xulu for the allegations. Mashaba's spokesperson Tony Taverna-Turisan says the board has not dealt with this case accordingly. We have witnesses coming forward alleging that they ve been intimidated during this process and that s simply unacceptable. It s exactly the reason why senior officials should be placed on suspension during such serious investigations. We have to ensure that we act swiftly and that we protect those witnesses and whistle-blowers that are coming forward. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
