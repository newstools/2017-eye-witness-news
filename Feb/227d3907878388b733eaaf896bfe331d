We are not going to be intimidated by soldiers, by police or criminals who are hell bent at defending a constitutional delinquent a man who is prepared to violate the Constitution.&quot; Sanef deputy chairperson Katy Katopodis says, There appears to have been confusion by individual members of the security establishment who adopted a haphazard approach and appeared not to be aware of assurances that the media would not be obstructed. Sanef is deeply concerned by these events as we view it as a security crackdown on the media in the wake of broader securitisation of what ought to be the people s Parliament.
