Mathews Phosa has been growing steadily more critical of President Jacob Zuma &amp; the ANC over the last few years. JOHANNESBURG Former African National Congress (ANC) treasurer Mathews Phosa says the ANC will have to perform a miracle to get anywhere near 50% of the vote in 2019, and that President Jacob Zuma must leave office now.He s written in the Sunday Independent newspaper that he refuses to have his coffin buried in the same graveyard as leaders who place their own corrupt interests above the people.Phosa has been growing steadily more critical of Zuma over the last few years, but this is unusually strong language for a former ANC leader.Phosa says the refusal of Zuma and National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to hold a moment s silence for the Life Esidimeni victims in Parliament during the State of the Nation Address (Sona) 10 days ago was a pivotal moment, as the ANC had refused to bow its head in shame.He also says the Democratic Alliance (DA) was right to raise the issue, the Congress of the People (Cope) was right to call Zuma a scoundrel and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was right to ask why there were soldiers in Parliament.Phosa says if Zuma doesn t resign, he will go down in history as the chief architect in the destruction of the ANC.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
