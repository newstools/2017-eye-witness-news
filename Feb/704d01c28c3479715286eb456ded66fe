Photographs of the Sona clashes and videos of MPs being dragged out ran under headlines describing the punch up. LONDON - The violence and drama that accompanied President Jacob Zuma s State of the Nation Address has made headlines in the UK. Photographs of the clashes in the National Assembly and videos of Members of Parliament (MPs) being dragged out ran under headlines describing the punch up. The wording of all the headlines was almost identical, describing how a brawl erupted inside South Africa s Parliament.The video footage was also similar, the dramatic moments when the so-called white shirts stormed in to remove Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MPs. Whatever Zuma s message was to his nation and the wider global audience was completely drowned out by the violence. Meanwhile in the UK, the Speaker of the House of Commons is now facing a motion of no confidence after criticising Donald Trump and the Labour Party has seen a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet following four Brexit-related resignations.WATCH: The President chuckles as EFF MPs are thrown out of Parliament
