Over the weekend several ANC leaders said they were going to try to use the meeting to push for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to be fired. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says its national executive committee has wrapped up its meeting on Monday and insists only policy was discussed during the gathering. That s despite several high-ranking ANC leaders having told Eyewitness News at the weekend that they were going to try to use the meeting to push for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to be fired after former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe was nominated to Parliament.Meanwhile, the ANC in the North West is standing by its nomination of Molefe but says it has no opinion on whether Gordhan should be fired.The ANC s North West provincial secretary Dakota Legoete says it simply doesn t have a view on whether Gordhan should be removed from the post of Finance Minister and replaced by Molefe. It would not be in our authority and prerogative, it is Section 91 of the Constitution of the republic which gives the president that particular responsibility. Last year the Public Protector s state capture report said Molefe had been to the Guptas Saxonwold home 19 times in just four months.But Legoete says he has no relationship with the Gupta family. I don t know the Guptas and I don t know the relationship of Molefe with the Guptas. However, he does say he doesn t understand why people are criminalising the Guptas when black people only control 3% of the JSE.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
