It was obviously frustrating to come back and be one over for the last four holes, Waring told reporters. But I ve always felt like I played quite well here, so I m looking forward to the last round. Dean Burmester also dropped a shot on Saturday to slip back to 10 under and will begin the third round in a share of third place alongside fellow South African Jacques Kruyswijk.Defending champion Haydn Porteous was among a group on nine under after matching his first-round score of 67 in his second round.
