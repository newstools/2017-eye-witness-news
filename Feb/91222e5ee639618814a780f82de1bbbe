Now with the science, players can go on much longer,&quot; said the Ivorian.&quot;I don't know about next season. I don't think about it. I am just about enjoying having my team mates around. You have guys like Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling who sometimes pass me and say 'Ah, uncle is on the phone',&quot; he told British media.&quot;When you see my career, it is one year, two years, three years maximum at one club. It is a long time. What the fans give to me, I want to give it back so I will do all I can until the last minute and if I am done, when I am done, I am done.&quot;It depends on the board because I don't have nothing to say.
