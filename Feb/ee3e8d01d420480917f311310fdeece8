The families of three mine workers whose bodies are still trapped underground were promised R200,000 as compensation. CAPE TOWN Business rescue practitioners for Mpumalanga's Lily Mine say there's no guarantee that promises of compensation to families of three mine workers, who died in a shaft collapse, can be fulfilled.Parliament's portfolio committee on mineral resources has heard that R4.3 million is needed to make the payments, but there's no money. This follows an announcement by Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane a year ago, that affected parties would be compensated by Vantage Goldfields.The committee says it is confused and needs to know who made the commitment and on what basis. A year ago, the families of three mine workers whose bodies are still trapped underground were promised R200,000 as compensation.Employees who were trapped underground, but survived were promised R50,000 each.But business rescue practitioner Rob Devereux has told Parliament that the company made no such decision.Chairperson of Parliament's Mineral Resources Committee Sahlulele Luzipho wants to know how the promise came to be made if the funds are not available. &quot;The truth of the matter is you don't have money... and that's the fact... that promise that you will pay the four-point something. Let's just accept the reality (sic).&quot;Devereux says compensation can't be paid until all the money required is raised to ensure it does not run out before all the payments are made.WATCH: Lily Mine: A forgotten tragedy(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
