HARARE - The Zimbabwe government has slammed Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane over his call this week for President Robert Mugabe to step down. Mugabe turned 93 on Tuesday and in a birthday interview said many supporters would be disappointed if he didn t stand in elections next year. Zimbabwe Information Minister Christopher Mushohwe is having a busy time fending off criticism from South African opposition leaders. Last month it was Julius Malema. Now Maimane has been criticised over his call for President Mugabe to step down and make way for a post-liberation age. In a statement, Mushohwe said it didn t surprise him that Mugabe should be a natural target of the DA, which he said was white-driven. The minister said southern African governments don t get their legitimacy from white interests that want to turn the clock back.Last month, the minister took Malema to task after he said Mugabe should let go of power.WATCH: 'Grandpa, it's enough now'
