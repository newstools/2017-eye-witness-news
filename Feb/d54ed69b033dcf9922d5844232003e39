JOHANNESBURG - South African Revenue Service (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane has described as regrettable Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan attributing the decline in tax revenue to the performance of the revenue service.Moyane briefed the media in Pretoria earlier on Friday, following Gordhan's 2017 budget speech on Wednesday.The minister told the National Assembly that Sars will collect R30 billion less than projected last year, calling it the largest under performance since the 2009 recession.Moyane says it s regrettable that statement comes from the minister. Such utterances by a person as senior as the Minister of Finance poses serious challenges to the overall credibility of the revenue service as an institution. Moyane says there are reasons for the decline in revenue collection. First, Custom duties were dragged down by R6.5 billion as a result of a contraction in real terms in imports. Second value added tax similarly was dragged down by import VAT collections to an underperformance by R11.3 billion. Finally personal income tax, which was long the anchor of revenue collections, underperformed by R15.2 billion. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
