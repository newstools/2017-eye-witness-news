Individuals are the beneficiaries, that s why they are protecting the president. For us, it s now to call on South Africans to be active citizens to raise their voices and not be loyal to the political party that brought democracy. But not all Save SA supporters were happy with Pityana insulting Zuma with some chasing him away after the event.WATCH: Angry protesters chase off Save SA campaigner Sipho Pityana(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
