CAPE TOWN - Eskom says Treasury has spoken and the Independent Power Procurement Progamme will go ahead. In his State of the Nation Address last week, President Jacob Zuma said government is committed to the project. He adds the programme will be expanded to other sources including coal and gas, in addition to renewable energy sources.Eskom s Khulu Phasiwe says they are on board with the president s commitment. Indeed the Treasury has spoken and we as Eskom essentially will be making sure we sign on the programmes that have been committed. It has to be at this stage that the ones that have been committed are up to what we call 'window 4.5'. Zuma said that the utility will sign the 37 outstanding power purchase agreements for renewable energy. Last year, some parties accused Eskom of refusing to sign these documents.But Phasiwe says the delay was due to a scheduled meeting between them and the Energy Department. So we can give them the context in which we are going to fund this project going forward. Government has heard our side of the story and we re going to continue with the funding of this project.
