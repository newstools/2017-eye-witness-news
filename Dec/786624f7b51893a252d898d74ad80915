                                         JOHANNESBURG - Five people have been arrested after the City of Joburg raided two hijacked buildings in Hillbrow and Berea. Officials say the group were apprehended in the early hours of Friday morning after being found in possession of drugs. Over a dozen cases of alcohol were confiscated in the raids. Spokesperson Lucky Sindane says: “We’re going to intensify these crime prevention operations leading up to the festive season as we know that hijackers take advantage of people going on holidays and hijacking their properties.”
