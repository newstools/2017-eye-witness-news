                                         JOHANNESBURG - Union representatives say they are willing to negotiate with SABC management but they won't tolerate exploitation. Employees affiliated with the Communications Workers Union (CWU) and Bemawu went on strike on Thursday over salary increases. They're demanding a 10% hike while the employer is offering 4.5%. About 100 workers are camping outside the SABC’s Auckland Park offices for a second day of protests. On Thursday union bosses handed over a memorandum to management. Negotiations are now underway. The CWU’s Tshepo Matlou says: “We are saying that management must meet us halfway. We can’t sit on 4.5%. We refuse that as an organisation. If they can come with a better offer, we can consult with our members.” It's unclear whether a deal will be struck today however unions have promised to continue with protests until an agreement is reached.
