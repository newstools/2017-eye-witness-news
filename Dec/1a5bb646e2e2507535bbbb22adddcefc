                                         JOHANNESBURG - The rand has strengthened by 0.5%. The local currency was already up by 3% at the close of trading on Friday.  It’s been hovering around the R13.07 mark to the US dollar, a level last seen in September. The market is pricing in a Cyril Ramaphosa win as the next ANC leader as he’s seen as a more investor-friendly candidate. Analysts also expect a Ramaposa win to prompt a rally in the rand to levels below R13 to the dollar.  They predict that a Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma win could see the currency touch levels of R14.57 to the greenback.
