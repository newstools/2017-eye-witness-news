                                         PIETERMARITZBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says it is not a coincidence that provinces known to support Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as the party’s next president have faced a barrage of legal battles this year. Secretary Super Zuma was speaking outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Thursday after their lawyers made arguments for leave to appeal. In September, Judge Jerome Mnguni declared the KZN ANC’s 2015 elective conference illegal. Zuma questioned why KZN, the Free State and the Northern Cape have continued to face court battles ahead of the elective conference. Super Zuma addressed dozens of supporters outside court after the proceedings, saying that they are willing to accept whatever outcome. However, Zuma says what they won’t tolerate is members trying to undo democratic processes of the party, making reference to their election at the 2015 conference. Meanwhile, inside court, lawyers representing the applicants Tembeka Ngcukaitobi have argued that the current executive is likely to prolong reaching a conclusion to this matter while frustrating his clients on a political level. The judges listened to arguments about why another court could interpret clause 17 of the ANC constitution which refers to how often conferences can be held. Judgment in the matter has been reserved.
