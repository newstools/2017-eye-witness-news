                                         CAPE TOWN – The family of a grade 11 learner at a Cape Town school is on their way to Vietnam where the girl died. Shannen Rustin was part of a group of learners from Westerford high school who was taking part in a school’s world challenge expedition in Hanoi this week. Rustin passed away yesterday, apparently while on a tour in Sapa valley, a popular trekking base. Western cape education MEC Debbie Schafer says details surrounding Rustin's death are scant at this stage. “I believe that she was on a cycling event on a Vietnam school tour that she collapsed when it was apparently very hot. We haven’t got specifics, surely they will come out in due time but I understand the family is on their way there.” Schafer says this is the second tragedy the school has had to face, following another learner's suicide earlier in the year.
