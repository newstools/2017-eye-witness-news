                                         PRETORIA – The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it’s disappointed but not surprised by NPA head Shaun Abrahams’ decision to grant President Jacob Zuma  a deadline extension over his fraud case. On Monday, the NPA boss announced the president has until the end of January to submit his representations to explain why he should not be prosecuted for corruption and fraud. Zuma missed his November deadline. Last week, the High Court found that Zuma abused court processes. The court also found that Abrahams had not conducted himself in an independent manner when dealing with cases involving the president.  The confirmation on Monday that Abrahams gave Zuma a two-month deadline extension appears to vindicate the court’s findings.  The DA has questioned whether Abrahams has the authority to extend Zuma’s deadline. “In the first place, one wonders whether Shaun Abrahams is in a position to grant Mr Zuma an extension until 31 January 2018 to submit representations as to why he should not be charged, given the decision last week by the High Court in Pretoria that Abrahams must vacate his position as National Director of Public Prosecutions,” a statement reads. The party says Zuma continues to receive special treatment. “The DA is also disappointed that Abrahams still refuses to treat Mr Zuma like any other accused. In the normal course of justice, the accused would be charged before a court of law and only then given the opportunity to make representations.” The party says despite “delaying tactics”, it remains committed to ensuring Zuma has his day in court.
