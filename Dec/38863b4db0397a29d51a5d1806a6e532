                                         JOHANNESBURG - Corruption Watch says it's pleased with the high court judgement which has given Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa the powers to appoint a new director of public prosecutions. Yesterday, the high court ordered prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams to vacate his office and that Ramaphosa and not President Jacob Zuma must fill the post within 60 days. A full bench of lawyers ruled that former prosecutions boss Mxolisi Nxasana's R17 million golden handshake be set aside and that he pay back the money but added that it would not be just if he were to be reinstated. Freedom Under Law, Corruption Watch and Casac had gone to court seeking an order declaring Nxasana's removal invalid. The watchdog's David Lewis said, “We are pleased that the high court declared that the president is not able to make the appointment of the new director of public prosecutions.”
