                                         CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) is considering giving ministers more control when it comes to managing state-owned companies that fall under them. Ayanda Dlodlo, who chairs the ANC NEC’s legislature and governance sub-committee, says the state of some SOEs requires “serious intervention”. New rules for the governance and oversight of SOEs will be debated when delegates gather for the party’s national conference in Nasrec, Soweto. While the focus has been on the leadership race, a range of policy proposals is also set to be decided. State-owned enterprises are supposed to help drive economic growth; instead, some, like Eskom, pose a risk to the economy. Dlodlo said: “The state of some SOEs calls for serious intervention to restore governance and prudential management.” Dlodlo says delegates to the party’s national conference will consider governance and oversight protocols for SOEs. “This will include how we empower the public to hold SOEs accountable, how legislatures play their role in tightening oversight and the executive taking full control in managing their portfolio of SOEs.” Dlodlo says ministers bear ultimate responsibility for SOEs, but boards don’t always want to account for them.
