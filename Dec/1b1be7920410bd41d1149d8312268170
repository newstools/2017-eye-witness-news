                                         JOHANNESBURG - Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says the will of the people has been upheld after he survived a vote on a motion of no confidence. The motion was brought by the African National Congress (ANC) which sought to remove Mashaba and Council Speaker Vasco da Gama from their posts. The ANC claims that Johannesburg residents are receiving poor services under their leadership.  One hundred and-forty-one members voted against the motion while 121 voted in support of it during a council sitting on Thursday night.  Mashaba's spokesperson Luyanda Mfeka says the motion was a desperate attempt by the ANC to regain control of the city’s purse to further corruption. “This was a frivolous motion and fortunately it didn’t affect how we conduct business and this administration will continue running its business.” Mashaba says the ANC’s failed attempt to remove him shows the party will never govern in Johannesburg ever again. “Actually it really makes me sad and angry if the ANC now is trying to destabilise us, particularly in Gauteng where they are used to using the government as their ATM machines.” WATCH: Joburg Mayor Mashaba survives no confidence vote
