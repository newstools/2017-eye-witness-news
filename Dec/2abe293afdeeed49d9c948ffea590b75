                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Water and Sanitation Department says its closely monitoring the Jukskei River with more rain forecast in Gauteng this week. Low-lying areas along the river in Alexandra have been affected by the downpours.  The department's Sputnik Ratua says that while the rain has been widely welcome, they’re concerned about those who live close to the river. “The Juskei is always a concern, you know once it starts rising and flowing strongly because of the proximity to where some of our country people live. We are hoping it will still flow but not negatively impact the people living near the river banks." The weather service has issued a watch for severe thunderstorms in Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
