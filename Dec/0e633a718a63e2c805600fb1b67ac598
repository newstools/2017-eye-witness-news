                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Johannesburg says the red berets will never allow the African National Congress (ANC) to get back in power and remains more willing to work with the Democratic Alliance (DA) despite not agreeing with their policies. This comes after Thursday’s motion of no confidence votes in Mayor Herman Mashaba and speaker Vasco da Gama failed. The EFF’s 30 seats in council helped Mashaba and Da Gama to stay in power, defeating the ANC’s motion with 18 and 19 more votes respectively.

The DA says the failed motions show the strength of the coalition government.
