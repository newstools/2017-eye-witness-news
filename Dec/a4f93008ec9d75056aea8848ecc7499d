                                         POLOKWANE - African National Congress (ANC)  branch delegates have arrived at Bolivia Lodge in Polokwane ahead of the party’s provincial general council. Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal are the last provinces to put forward their preferred candidates for the ANC’s leadership ahead of the national conference in two weeks’ time. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma appear to be the front-runners in the race for the party’s top spot. After intense campaigning in the Sekhukhune and Mopani regions, Dlamini Zuma seems to have gained ground but it’s believed Ramaphosa will come out victorious. ANC officials including Thoko Didiza have already arrived where Limpopo’s preferred top six candidates will be announced from consolidated branch votes. The party’s Deputy General Secretary Jessie Duarte will give the opening address.
