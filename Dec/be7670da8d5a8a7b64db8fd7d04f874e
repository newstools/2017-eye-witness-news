                                         JOHANNESBURG - Outgoing African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe says he wants to be remembered for trying everything to keep the organisation from falling apart. The party's national conference will start at the weekend where a new leadership will be elected. Mantashe says the biggest challenging during his tenure was dealing with the daily damage to the ANC's reputation. “What I want to be known for is that we did everything at the centre to keep the ANC together when it could have torn itself apart. We are going into this election with our eyes not on 20 December our eyes are on 2019. Everything we do we put our energy on ensuring that the ANC comes out intact, better and strong.” Mantashe also reacted to the controversial Mpumalanga unity vote. He reiterated that delegates will not have the option to vote for unity this weekend. “To get into the ballot paper you must be nominated by at least one province. Now if you are not nominated by one province you’re not going to get into the ballot paper. And therefore, unity will not get into the ballot paper because it’s a spoiled nomination. It’s not a spoiled ballot paper, it’s a spoiled nomination.”
