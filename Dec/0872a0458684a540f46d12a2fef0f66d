                                         JOHANNESBURG - It’s unclear when the re-run of the by-election in the Metsimaholo Municipality will take place after the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) ordered a revote in the Zamdela ward. There were claims of irregularities and vote during this week’s elections.  The South African Communist Party (SACP) contested the by elections for the first time going head to head with the African National Congress (ANC) and raised concerns over the legitimacy of the voting process. The Communist Party claimed that dozens of people were bused in to vote and said that even dead people were registered. The party’s Alex Mashilo says the situation in Zamdela was bad. “You couldn’t open a ballot box for PR votes and count votes from that box. That was disrupting the counting process, and you can’t use the ballot papers of one ward in another ward.”
