                                         CAPE TOWN - The Golden Arrow bus service says its commuters can expect a hike in fares from Christmas Day.  Fares will be increased by an average of 7% due to soaring fuel costs. Over the last 12 months, the price of diesel has increased by 12% while the nationally determined wages increased by 9%. Golden Arrow's Bronwen Dyke-Beyer says these two cost items make up about 74% of the bus operator's total costs. “The bus services will regrettably be increasing its passenger fares by an average of 7% as of 25 December 2017. Pensioner fares and most off-peak fares will not increase. A decision to increase bus fares is never taken lightly, in this case, it is simply unavoidable.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
