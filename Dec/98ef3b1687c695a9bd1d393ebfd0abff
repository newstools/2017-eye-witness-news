                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Transport Department has urged law enforcement agencies to assist Metrorail in addressing vandalism to its infrastructure. Large-scale damage has been done to equipment on the rail operator’s central line adding to the woes of commuters. Operations on the notorious central line have on Monday been thrown into disarray yet again due to vandalism and cable theft over the weekend. All trips have been suspended on the line that serves Bonteheuwel, Nyanga and Netreg. Technicians are assessing the damage. Spokesperson for the provincial transport MEC Siphesihle Dube said: “The Western Cape government has strongly condemned these acts by these criminal elements that continue to target Metrorail. We also call on members of the community to assist us as well as law enforcement officials to work together to find a speedy solution to make sure that these elements are brought o justice.” Metrorail says vandals who've been targeting its infrastructure and equipment have been relentless this year. Metrorail's Richard Walker says mini sub-stations were destroyed near Bonteheuwel. He adds the illegal scrap trade is making it impossible for the rail service to secure its infrastructure and equipment. "All other conventional fencing that we’ve put in those areas, in the previous financial year we spent about R10 million on concrete palisades that have mostly been removed.” Last week cable theft in Kuils River caused disruptions on the northern line. Meanwhile, gang-related crimes have also seen an increase in these communities. There’ve been more than 12 attacks on Metrorail officials in the Western Cape this year.
