                                         JOHANNESBURG - In a scathing judgment, the Constitutional Court  has ruled the City of Johannesburg  violated the rights of 11 people who were evicted in 2012. The city moved the residents from Saratoga Avenue in Johannesburg to a shelter in 2012.  There, they were split up from their families into men’s and women’s dormitories and locked out of the shelter during the day. The court has found the city’s treatment of the residents was cruel, condescending and degrading. The Socio-Economic Rights Institute represented the group in court.  Its community research and advocacy officer Edward Molopi said: “It vindicates what the residents have been saying and that there is a place for poor people in the inner-city and just because you do not have a source of income it doesn’t mean that your rights have to be taken away.”
