                                         JOHANNESBURG - Proteas seamer Dane Paterson took 4 for 24, to inspire the Cobras to a narrow 5-run victory over the Knights in Kimberley in the T20 Challenge on Wednesday night.  The Cobras, who are on a 4-match winning streak, set the Knights a competitive 156 for victory, thanks largely to a well-constructed 46 off 39 deliveries from opener Temba Bavuma, and an innings boosting 31 off 20 deliveries from captain JP Duminy late in the innings.  Paterson struck early in the Knights' run chase, removing both openers, Rudi Second and Keegan Petersen, for 1 and 4 respectively. Captain Theunis de Bruyn and the swashbuckling David Miller then went about resurrecting the Knights' run chase with a solid partnership, before Paterson returned in the 14th over to remove Miller for 59 (32) and Ryan McLaren for 19 (14) to end the Knights' chances of victory.  The win keeps the Cobras second behind the Titans on the log, while the defeat sees the Knights drop down to fifth, just two points ahead of the Warriors who are bottom of the log. The Dolphins and the Lions had to share the spoils in Durban, after yet another rained out result. This is the Dolphins' fourth no result in Durban due to rain.
