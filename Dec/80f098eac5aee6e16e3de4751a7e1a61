                                         NEW YORK - The women at the centre of the wave of sexual misconduct allegations, which have inspired others across the world to tell their own stories of harassment, have been dubbed Associated Press's (AP) Entertainer of the Year. This follows on from 'Time' magazine naming the women or as it called them "the silence breakers" its person of the year. In a further indication of just how far-reaching the sexual misconduct claims have been, the Associated Press has added its weight to the issue, naming the women in Hollywood who spoke out as part of the #MeToo movement its entertainer of the year. In the past, the title has gone to the likes of Adele and Lady Gaga, and while some have bristled at the phrase, many say it speaks to the importance of the movement that was sparked by a bombshell New York Times investigation into super-producer Harvey Weinstein. The wave of allegations that have stretched across the country and indeed the world, seeing top TV figures, chefs, journalists and publishers disgraced, was also named the top news story of 2017 in an AP poll.
