                                         CAPE TOWN - A flight attendant has been recognised as one of the Western Cape’s biggest promoters of water saving and awareness. South African Airways (SAA) chief flight attendant Alexander “Zanda” Setlaleleng has been praised by the provincial government. Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde says Setlaleleng has been the star of his OR Tambo to Cape Town flight. Passengers travelling between OR Tambo and Cape Town airports say Setlaleleng’s entertaining approach is key in raising awareness of the Western Cape’s water crisis. For the flight attendant, it’s all in a day’s work: “Ladies and gentlemen, SAA would like to advise you that the Western Cape province is in the grips of the worst drought in 100 years. We’re under extreme water restrictions and appeal to you to stay within the daily allocated water limit.” Setlaleleng even supplies tips on how to save the precious resource. “Keep showers short, very short. Flush toilets less and close the tap while brushing your teeth. Let’s save water while we have water to save. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
