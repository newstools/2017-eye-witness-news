                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Community Party (SACP) says it accepts the outcome of the new African National Congress (ANC) leadership and has called for the “appropriate cleansing” of the party. Cyril Ramaphosa was elected the next president of the ANC at the party’s 54th national conference at Nasrec in Johannesburg on Monday evening. SACP’s first Deputy General-Secretary Solly Mapaila says organisational renewal should start from the ground. Mapaila says the new leadership should be given an opportunity to prove itself. “We mustn’t undermine the fact that comrade Ramaphosa won the presidency of the ANC and that’s extremely important. But is he committed to fighting corruption, corporate capture and to cleanse the leadership image? I think he is.” At the same time, University of Cape Town’s associated professor Richard Calland says Nkozasana Dlamini Zuma may have lost the presidential position, but her faction has won. “I think the faction will be quite delighted with tonight’s results and the premier league and patronage network that lies behind her will be deliriously happy with having secured the deputy presidentship in line for the president next time.” David Mabuza has been elected deputy president. Gwede Mantashe is the new national chairperson, while Ace Magashule is secretary general. Jessie Duarte retains her position as deputy secretary general and Paul Mashatile is the new treasurer.
