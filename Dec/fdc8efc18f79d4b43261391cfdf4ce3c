The cause of the fire is under investigation.  Of the 270 people affected by the blaze, 83 children under the age of 10 have been left homeless.  Fourteen units in four blocks of flats, including 42 informal structures, were either damaged or completely destroyed.  The public and charity organisations are being encouraged to donate nappies, water and non-perishable food. Drakensteinâ€™s Acting Mayor Riaan Smuts says: "They can donate different sizes of nappies, different types of milk formula, shoes, new underwear, sanitary ware, water and non-perishable food." The Drakenstein Municipality says it will assist those who have been left homeless. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
