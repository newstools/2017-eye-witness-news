                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police in Pretoria say the number of car break-ins in Sunnyside is at an alarming rate standing at over 1,600 a year. While there has been a decline in car break-ins between last year and this year, police claim the decline is not a significant one. The police’s Daniel Mavimbela says break-ins can be avoided. “Our people, undoubtedly, have a tendency of leaving their valuables inside their vehicles. Every second or third car that’s broke into you, find that a laptop is among the stolen items.”
