                                         JOHANNESBURG - Save SA convener Sipho Pityana has penned an open letter to newly elected ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa, congratulating him on winning the elections and calling him a person of integrity.  He then uses the letter to launch a scathing attack on former ANC president Jacob Zuma. Pityana says he is hoping not to wait too long before Save SA can congratulate Ramaphosa on his election as president of the country. He says this will "mean we have finally seen the back of the worst president in the history of the ANC, and the most corrupt leader in post-apartheid South Africa, Jacob Zuma". Pityana then calls Ramaphosa "a person of integrity" who has respect for the Constitution. He tells the new ANC president not only to lead the party out of the darkness brought on by his predecessor, but to lead South Africa back to the path of respect for the rule of law, the protection of sovereignty and true inclusive growth. The former ANC official says he believes there must be no hesitation in Ramaphosa mobilising his NEC to recall Zuma and to get rid of the many rotten apples that he and his family surrounded themselves with. He then lists six demands, including an immediate judicial commission of inquiry into state capture.  Pityana signs off by saying “Ke nako”, which means “it’s time”. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
