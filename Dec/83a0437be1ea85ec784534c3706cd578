                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Mathews Phosa  has confirmed his campaign has filed urgent papers in the High Court in Pretoria to nullify the Mpumalanga provincial general council. Mpumalanga delegates say “unity” is their preferred candidate after the close contest between presidential hopefuls Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa. Two-hundred-and-twenty-three delegates abstained from voting in the ANC provincial general council which handed Dlamini Zuma a nomination in that province. Phosa alleges that provincial Premier David Mabuza has a militia made up of MKMVA  members who are being used to disrupt some branch meetings and intimidate members who wanted to vote for either himself or Cyril Ramaphosa. However, the Mpumalanga ANC has denied the allegation, saying it’s an unfounded and desperate attempt by Phosa to rescue his presidential campaign. The matter is expected to be heard in court on Tuesday.
