                                         JOHANNESBURG - Trade union Numsa has criticised the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) for granting Eskom a 5.2% tariff increase, as it's above inflation and will negatively affect the working class. The power utility initially requested a 19.9% electricity hike. The union says the tariff hike is likely to result in some companies shutting down, leading to more job losses, and in turn stifling economic growth. Numsaâ€™s Phakamile Hlubi: "The energy regulator is demonstrating that it does not act in the interests of the working class majority and the public in general. Eskom is poorly led, its senior management team is drowning in scandal, therefore paying more for electricity means endorsing this blatant theft of our country's resources."
