                                         CAPE TOWN - The real work of discussing African National Congress (ANC) policies was expected to get underway once a new leadership was elected and it’s understood some commissions have started. But as a result of several delays and the party's steering committee had to urgently decide how to resolve a dispute over 68 votes that were not counted during Monday's election, it's unclear how the party's going to get through the rest of the programme before Wednesday evening. Officials at the party's 54th national conference at Nasrec in Johannesburg have indicated that voting might take place later on Wednesday evening. The composition of the national executive committee will be crucial in determining the balance of power in the ANC’s top structure since the top six officials are a mix of leaders from both the Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma camps. Some of the work that delegates have to get through include the issue of organisational renewal, strategy and tactics, and important policy matters around land redistribution and economic transformation.
