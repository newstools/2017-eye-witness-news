                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says it's planning to lodge a complaint with the electoral commission over the logo being used by outspoken former ANC MP Makhosi Khoza's new political party. Khoza launched the African Democratic Change in Braamfontein on Friday. The ANC says the use of the colours black, green and gold and the imagery of the newly formed party’s logo is a deliberate attempt to confuse voters. Spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said: “I think it’s a good thing and the right thing to do as the ANC, that when somebody for whatever reason forms his or her own organisation, people must establish their own identity, not appropriate to themselves the symbols, the icons of the African National Congress.” Khoza has not been available for comment.
