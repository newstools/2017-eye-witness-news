                                         CAPE TOWN - The average dam levels that have been recorded for the Western Cape is 32%, 20% less than the previous year. The Western Cape local government department says the ongoing drought that is gripping the province  remains a pressing concern. Alleviation measures continue across the province. The department's James Brent-Styan says areas in the province currently most affected by the drought include Beaufort-West and Kannaland, the City of Cape Town, Bitou and Knysna as well as the Matzikama region on the West Coast. “It’s literally all-hands-on-deck and we can only get through this period by taking hands and working together. We, from a provincial side, have reallocated some money, about R95 million and that will be going towards additional drought relief measure and water augmentation initiatives across the province.”
