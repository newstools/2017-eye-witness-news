                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says she's waiting for the Democratic Alliance (DA) to provide reasons for her extended suspension from party activities. The party on Thursday said she was being given until Monday to defend why she should not resign as mayor.  “I am aware of the media statement by the DA. I can also confirm I received a letter from the party to suspend me. I am still waiting for the reasons of my suspension from the party and will not comment any further.” The DA says its internal investigation has found sufficient cause for concern over De Lille’s governance of the city but won't say exactly what it's found until she's responded to the claims. The party's federal executive will be meeting next week to discuss De Lille’s future. De Lille is also facing allegations of corruption from a top aide in her office, which is now the subject of a separate city investigation. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
