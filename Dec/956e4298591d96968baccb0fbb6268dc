                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) chairperson Paul Mashatile says those who head up the party should prioritise the people they serve at all times instead of using their office for personal gain.  Mashatile was speaking at the Gauteng ANC provincial council, where Cyril Ramaphosa was chosen for the post of ANC president by the provincial structure.  Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu was nominated for the position of deputy president. Mashatile says a leader should carry the characteristics of the iconic ANC members who led the party during apartheid. “We’ve learnt it from comrade OR Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Nelson Mandela and those who before us that you must be brave in leadership… take decisions and that you must always lead with humility.”
