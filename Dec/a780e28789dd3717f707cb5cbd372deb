The congress will take place on Friday which will be exactly a month since the army took control of the country. HARARE - Zimbabwe’s ruling party is due to hold a congress this week to confirm Emmerson Mnangagwa as its candidate in next year’s elections. The congress will take place on Friday which will be exactly a month since the army took control of the country. Huge white tents have gone up in Harare’s Robert Mugabe Square, known to activists as Freedom Square which is the venue of Friday’s congress. This congress will now take place for one day, instead of two. The budget has been slashed from $8 million to $3 million. A party spokesman has said this won’t be an elective congress, although Mnangagwa may get to appoint his two vice presidents and fill vacancies in the politburo created by the expulsion of Grace Mugabe and her allies from the party.
