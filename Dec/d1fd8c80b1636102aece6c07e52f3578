                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says the party's top leadership, including the president, will be announced on Sunday. Delegates will descend on Nasrec in Soweto on Saturday to vote for what has been seen as a race between Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa. Party spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says members will be voting for the top six leaders on Saturday and the outcome will be announced on Sunday morning. “The Sunday morning as we rise, we should be able to make an announcement of the top six and the nominations of the rest of the leadership. “We needed to take out this item from the conference agenda as quickly as possible so that we deal with emotions, we deal with palpitations that people come to the conference with.” Kodwa says the ANC will also make sure that discipline is exercised among all delegates at the conference.
