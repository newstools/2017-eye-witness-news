                                         JOHANNESBURG - The highly-contested Metsimaholo Municipality in the Free State continues to remain a hung council, following the by-elections this week where there’s no outright winner.  The municipality will either face an election rerun or coalition government, as the African National Congress won 16 seats, the Democratic Alliance 11, and the Economic Freedom Fighters eight. The South African Communist Party (SACP) also made a small feature winning three seats in its first ANC-independent contestation. The hotly-contested municipality was dissolved after the coalition-led government failed to pass its budget. SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande says winning three council seats is a remarkable achievement. “The central committee congratulated the SACP Free State comrades on their performance in the Mestimaholo by-election and thanked communities for their support to the party.” Nzimande says their contestants faced threats from ANC members during the campaign. “We also achieved this result in the face of considerable destabilisation efforts and threats emanating from Ace Magashule and his corporately-captured Free State ANC faction.”
