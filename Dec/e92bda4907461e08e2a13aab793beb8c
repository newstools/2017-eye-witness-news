                                         CAPE TOWN - The Eastern Cape Traditional Affairs Department has pleaded with parents to ensure their teenage boys go to legal initiation schools. The summer traditional initiation season has already seen six deaths in that province, caused by dehydration and septicaemia. One boy also committed suicide. Seven more initiatives have been hospitalised following botched circumcisions. The department's Mamkeli Ngam says: “We want to appeal to parents, community leaders and community-based organisations to work together and take over the practice of initiation. You need to monitor it to ensure no forms of abuse takes place in that environment so that they work within the parameters of the law.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
