                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Commission for Gender Equality says it applauds the African National Congress (ANC) for its decision to fully decriminalise sex work in South Africa. The announcement was made by the party's social transformation commission on Wednesday at the ANC's elective conference. Decriminalisation would see criminal penalties being removed for sex workers as well as those making use of their services. The policy is similar to New Zealand's legal framework. The commission's Javu Baloyi said: “The commission applauds the resolution as we have presented before Parliament, calling for the decriminalisation of sex work. It will go a long way in assisting sex workers coming from the heathen peripheries and some of them will accept the health facilities that are there form the government.”
