CAPE TOWN - Additional law enforcement officials have been deployed in Delft  as part of the City of Cape Town's neighbourhood safety team initiative. The initiative was rolled out on Monday and will see officials from the stabilisation unit, school resource officers, gang and drug task team and neighbourhood safety officers being present in the area. The campaign is designed to take the municipality's safety and security interventions to crime hotspots. The city's JP Smith says they're hoping to roll it out in policing precincts with the highest crime rates. “We are committing to at least a three-year and potentially up to a five-year intervention where we will make sure that we turn Delft around. That we give Delft the chance to achieve the kind of social cohesion and economic development that it needs and all of that can only happen if we stabilise the crime and grime.”
