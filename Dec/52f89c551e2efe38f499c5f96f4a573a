                                         JOHANNESBURG - Naspers  says it’s not been informed of any legal action from investors, following reports that a United States (US) law firm intends investigating a number of alleged irregularities. US law firm Pomerantz has confirmed it is now probing whether Naspers and its directors took part in security fraud or other unlawful business practices. MultiChoice has been accused of paying millions of rands to the SABC and ANN7 in exchange for political influence in the ongoing digital migration saga. Naspers says it takes the allegations of improper payments seriously and once the MultiChoice board has investigated the matter, it will verify whether the issue was addressed adequately. African National Congress National Executive Committee member Jackson Mthembu says he supports calls for an independent investigation. “Because If you want to benefit and you then want to influence government policy towards your benefit as a private citizen, or corporate citizen - indeed you might be trying to capture the state.”
