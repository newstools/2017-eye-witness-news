                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department has confirmed a caretaker has been shot and killed during a robbery at a high school in the south of Johannesburg. It's understood robbers broke into Die Fakkel High School in the early hours of Monday morning. Officials say the caretaker heard a suspicious noise and was cornered by the gunmen who then opened fire. The department's Steve Mabona says the robbers made off with some computers and a TV. “I think they were disturbed in that process and they managed to run away. It’s quite disturbing that people would want to go to a school and conduct criminal activities.”
