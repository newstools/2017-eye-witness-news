                                         CAPE TOWN - Sentencing is expected today in the trial of convicted rapist and murderer Randy Tango. He was arrested shortly after the body of 11-year-old Stacha Arendse was found dumped on a field in Tafelsig earlier this year. Tango last week pleaded guilty to raping and murdering Arendse in Tafelsig. In his admissions read out in court last week, Tango admitted to raping Arendse twice in his home and then strangling her to death because he was afraid she would tell her mother. The child killer lived in the same street as the deceased and her family. Judge Robert Henney found Tango not guilty on four counts of rape involving two women between 2010 and 2011, due to a lack of strong evidence. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
