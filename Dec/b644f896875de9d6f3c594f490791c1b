                                         JOHANNESBURG - USA Today is reporting that two American consumers on Thursday filed a proposed class-action breach-of-contract suit, saying they did not consent to allow Apple to slow their older iPhones. On Monday, a company that makes an app for measuring the speed of an iPhone’s processor, the blog Primate Labs, published data that appeared to show slower performance in the Apple’s iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 models as they aged. Apple on Wednesday acknowledged that the company does take some measures to reduce power demands - which can have the effect of slowing the processor - when a phone’s battery is having trouble supplying the peak current that the processor demands. "As a result of Defendant’s wrongful actions, Plaintiffs and Class Members had their phone slowed down, and thereby it interfered with Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ use or possession of their iPhones," according to the lawsuit, which has been posted online by a New York CBS TV station. USA Today reports that Apple didn't respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit. Additional reporting by Reuters.
