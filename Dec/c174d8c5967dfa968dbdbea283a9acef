                                         MBOMBELA – The once controversial ‘Save the ANC’ Mpumalanga group leader Peter Nyoni has urged provincial chair of the African National Congress (ANC) David Mabuza to forge ahead with unity to save the party. During a provincial general council meeting, 223 branches abstained from voting in favour of a so-called unity candidate. Nyoni and the group openly challenged the leadership of the province led by Mabuza, alleging lack of transparency and accountability coupled with corruption. He says the current national ANC top six leaders don’t seem to advocate for unity. He says those interested in the party’s top leadership positions need to sit and talk at the conference next weekend  and have the conference’s outcome show and have unity. “You understand that a house divided against itself can’t stand, and we can’t be bystanders as members of the ANC and leave our fate to people who have interests, 110% interest.” He says party leaders should not be oblivious that the ANC loses votes to opposition parties on every national election since 1994- and should denounce slates politics in an effort to save the ailing ANC. Meanwhile, a Cyril Ramaphosa support campaign continues today at the Elijah Mango College where delegates in favour of his presidential campaign are expected to convene. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
