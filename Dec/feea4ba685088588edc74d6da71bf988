                                         MPUMALANGA - African National Congress (ANC) Mpumalanga chairperson David Mabuza is calling for “unity” ahead of the party’s conference in December. Mabuza and presidential hopefuls have arrived at the Mbombela Stadium ahead of the provincial general council where branch nominations will be consolidated for the party's leadership race this month. Several other provinces, including the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Free State, have already completed their PGCs. Mabuza says that the ANC needs to be unified in order to represent its constituents properly. “We are carrying souls, so we must not fail you.” EWN understands that deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa  and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma have emerged as the front-runners during branch nominations held in the province last month. National chairperson Baleka Mbete  will deliver the opening address before branch nominations are consolidated.
