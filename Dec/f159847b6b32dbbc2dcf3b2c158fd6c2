                                         JOHANNESBURG - KwaZulu-Natal police are searching for murder suspects in two separate incidents where homes were set alight, leading to the deaths of seven people. It's understood the first incident occurred in Umlazi on Thursday night, where a house was set alight with three people still inside. Police were conducting operations in the vicinity when they heard gunshots and started chasing a group of men. The suspects returned fire and managed to flee. The police's Thulani Zwane says the second incident happened on Tuesday in Mtwalume - where four people died after the house they were in was also set alight. “In both incidents, there are no arrests made yet and the police have launched a manhunt for the suspects.”
