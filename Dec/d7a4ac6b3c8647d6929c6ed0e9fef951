It wants bosses to get first-hand experience of what ordinary workers have to endure on the city’s train lines. The city’s Brett Herron, who is spearheading the municipality's plan to take over the management of the rail network, took a train trip from Khayelitsha to Cape Town on Thursday. “I need to bring corporate leaders to do his trip next week. They need to see what their employees go through every day. My next step is to bring the right people to do this trip with me and get the next step of our rail plan into action.” WATCH: CT Transport official experiences Metrorail service first-hand  Meanwhile, it remains to be seen if the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) will appeal the High Court ruling on a negligence case against it. A commuter, who was flung from a moving train in 2011, has claimed victory after the Western Cape High Court ruled that Prasa was negligent. A judge found the company had failed to ensure the doors of the coach that Masibulele Rautini was travelling on were closed and no security guards were on duty. He was pushed from a moving train during a robbery. Rautini’s attorney Jan Potgieter says: “Our client is extremely happy that he’ll receive the compensation. It was a very long and emotional road for him, so he is very happy.” LISTEN: Off the rails: CT's rail woes laid bare  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
