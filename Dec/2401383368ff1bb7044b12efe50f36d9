                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Sevens side are banking on their experience, ahead of the Cape Town leg of the World Rugby Sevens Series starting on Saturday morning.  The Blitzboks kicked off the defence of their series title with the defence of their Dubai 7’s title in the opening tournament in Dubai last week.  Neil Powell’s men went through the Dubai tournament unbeaten, although they started the tournament slowly, with a laboured performance against Uganda, they eventually beat rivals New Zealand 24-12 in the cup final.  Powell has decided to go with an unchanged side for the home tournament, and is still the most experienced sevens squad assembled, boasting a combined tournament total of 458, and an average of 38 tournaments per player.  Four players - Chris Dry (63), Kyle Brown (59), Branco du Preez (56) and Cecil Afrika (54) - have played in more than 50 tournaments, while Blitzbok captain Philip Snyman will be playing in his 49th.  Dry, who is the second-most capped player ever, says that experience in the squad is a big bonus ahead of the home tournament.  "That experience is very important and helps in tight situations. For me personally, to play 300 matches was a massive honour and something I am really proud of.”  The Blitzboks face Russia, France and Kenya in the pool stages starting on Saturday.
