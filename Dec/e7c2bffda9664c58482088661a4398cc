                                         CAPE TOWN - A number of US athletes have spoken out against Donald Trump during his presidency and skier Lindsey Vonn has become the latest to have her say. Targeting Olympic gold at February’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Vonn is in Switzerland, where she spoke passionately about what it means to compete for the US ski team. She said she hoped to represent the people of the United States, not the president. This year Trump has been embroiled in a controversy with the NFL and some of the NBA’s top players after he blasted prominent athletes for kneeling during the national anthem and refusing to come to the White House. And Vonn revealed she wouldn’t accept an invitation to the White House if she were to win gold at Pyeongchang.
