Over 4,000 delegates are expected to descend on Nasrec from 16 December to elect a new leadership and discuss policy. The ANC NEC meeting is expected to deal with court cases confronting the movement ahead of its national congress. The partyâ€™s various leadership in the Northern Cape, Free State, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal are the subject of court cases. The meeting is also expected to address disputes that have arisen from branch general meetings over the past few months. The party's leaders will seek to come up with ways to avoid any threat to the elective conference as a result of disputes and court challenges.
