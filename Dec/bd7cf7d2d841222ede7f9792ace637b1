                                         CAPE TOWN - Two people have been taken in for questioning in connection with the murder of a defence force member in Oudtshoorn. Staff sergeant Preston Titus was stabbed to death last weekend at his home on a military base. His body was discovered by his wife and daughter.  Earlier this week, the police's Malcolm Poje said Titus was killed during a robbery. “Preliminary investigation reveals that the daughter was out for the evening. On her return around midnight there was no response from the victim’s side when she knocked. “She eventually woke up her mother who then opened the door and they discovered the body of the victim in the bedroom.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
