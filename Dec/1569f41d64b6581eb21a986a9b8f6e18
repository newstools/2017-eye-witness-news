                                         JOHANNESBURG - South African Communist Party (SACP) General Secretary Blade Nzimande says the proposed 19.9% electricity increase is unacceptable and will have a negative impact on the lives of ordinary South Africans. Nzimande was briefing the media following the party's central committee meeting which was held this weekend in Ekurhuleni. He says over the past 10 years, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa has approved electricity tariff increases by almost 35%. Nzimande says these increases are way beyond initial justifiable levels and are without policy guidance. He says the increases also reflect years of mismanagement and corporate looting of the power utility. “The proposed 19.9% increase for 2018/19 cannot be justified. It will have a seriously negative impact on the lives of ordinary South Africans as well as mining and industrial users with further retrenchments a likely outcome.”
