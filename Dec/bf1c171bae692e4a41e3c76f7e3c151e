                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former president Kgalema Motlanthe says young people in the ANC have missed a chance to learn from late struggle stalwart Laloo Chiba because of the party’s arrogance. Motlanthe was speaking at Chiba’s memorial in Lenasia yesterday. The 87 year old died at his house on Friday after experiencing a mild heart attack during the week. The former president told mourners that while Chiba took EFF leaders on a tour of Robben Island and its history lessons on Ahmed Kathrada’s request, he would have wanted to do the same for the ANC. He says however that the ANC has a barrier of arrogance and complacency making it difficult to learn from stalwarts. “Instead of learning from comrades like Laloo, young leaders have new role models who present themselves as leaders of some revolution.” Although Chiba had been a member of the ANC for years his branch had failed to renew his membership when he died.
