                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng health's suspended head of department says the negligence that played out in the deadly Esidimeni project is shameful. Doctor Barney Selebano says he is ashamed of the tragedy and realises that traumatised South Africans no longer trust the public health system. Selebano was given the chance to give closing remarks after his testimony at the arbitration hearings in Parktown yesterday.  He apologised for his role in the project which led to the deaths of 143 mentally ill people. “This has brought shame to the department and shame to government. We made an error of judgement.”
