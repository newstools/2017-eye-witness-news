                                         CAPE TOWN - Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe’s employment status has come under sharp scrutiny on Tuesday with two witnesses insisting he was on a permanent contract. Molefe left Eskom last year with R30 million pension payout. But whether or not he was supposed to be a member of the utility’s pension and provident fund in the first place remains an ongoing legal dispute. Different phrases have been used to describe Molefe’s employment contract: some have called it a permanent contract, others say it was a fixed-term contract, but Anton Minnaar  added a new one to the list on Tuesday. Minnaar, the man who facilitated Molefe’s pension payout, understood Molefe to be a "permanent employee with a term.” “That’s why it’s so important to get that opinion finally on the employment with Eskom because that has to pass the way for us going forward as well. We obviously have to look at things totally different going forward.”  He insists Molefe’s early retirement was by the book. Eskom chairperson Zethembe Khoza also shared his take on the issue. “I think it’s a choice of words.” Members of Parliament are attempting to sort through the semantics to find the truth.
