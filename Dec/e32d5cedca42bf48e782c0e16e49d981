                                         JOHANNESBURG - Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe says the issue of not enough women being elected to the African National Congress (ANC)’s top six will be addressed when NEC members are announced. Radebe was addressing members of the Progressive Business Forum at the last breakfast briefing of the conference. Minister Radebe says doomsayers who had doubts about the elective conference will eat humble pie as the ANC is finalising all matters on Wednesday. He also says it is unfortunate that only one woman was elected to the top six. “But I can assure you that as we elect the national executive committee in terms of the ANC constitution, the leadership must be made up of at least 50% women. So, that will be adjusted during the NEC elections.” Radebe also addressed issues around economic growth and implementing the National Development plan to boost investor confidence.
