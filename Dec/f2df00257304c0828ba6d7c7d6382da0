                                         PRETORIA - Public Service Commissioner Michael Seloane says he’s urged President Jacob Zuma to review the delegation of powers to ensure that ministers are able to suspend heads of departments. He says the recent suspension of Home Affairs director-general Mkuseli Apleni earlier this year was not in the then minister Hlengiwe Mkhize’s power. Seloane says only the president has the power to appoint or suspend executives in government departments. He says the Public Service Commission has started talks with Minister Faith Muthambi on the delegation of powers. “The executive authority rests with the president and he has not delegated that to ministers.” Seloane has announced that a report on the financial misconduct of government employees will be released early next year after thorough investigations.
