                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) and coalition partners in the metros say they are determined to make their power-sharing agreement work. In the past week, the DA has had to fend off motions of no confidence in their mayors in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth. Party leaders met in Johannesburg on Wednesday to assess their performance in local government. Coalition parties in Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg and Pretoria say they share a core set of values which includes zero-tolerance for corruption and a commitment to deliver services to the poor. The parties count among their achievements this year, the selling of the mayoral mansion and the creation of more than 23,000 work opportunities in Tshwane, uncovering more than R2 billion in corruption in the City of Johannesburg and boosting capital expenditure and revenue collection in Nelson Mandela Bay to 93%. United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa was not present at Wednesday’s meeting. Relations soured with the DA in August, after it voted out the UDM’s deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani.
