                                         MBOMBELA - African National Congress (ANC)  Mpumalanga Chairperson David Mabuza says if the party's conference elects Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as president, then it would've backed a factional candidate. He made the comment just moments after the province held a general council where 223 abstentions narrowly allowed Dlamini Zuma to emerge as the preferred candidate. He says those abstentions signify unity but stopped short of explaining what exactly unity meant. Of all the top six positions contested, the so-called unity candidate received the most nominations but the abstentions do not count as votes. Two-hundred-and-twenty-three of 463 eligible voters abstained from the presidential nominations, with 231 abstaining from voting for the deputy president. The post for the deputy secretary, however, had the most abstinence with 312 of 463 voters’ tally. Mabuza says his province is just one of many but believes it will remain influential in installing credible leadership. “We’re just a province, the other provinces can overrule us but the journey ahead will be tough for the movement.” He says there must be negotiations to further deliberate on the essential values necessary for leaders.
