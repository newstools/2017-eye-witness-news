                                            Orlando Pirates can leapfrog leaders Baroka FC depending on other results, to the top of the ABSA Premier League, when they take on SuperSport United at the Orlando Stadium on Tuesday evening. 

                                         JOHANNESBURG- Orlando Pirates will go top of the log, should they beat SuperSport United, depending on other results on the night, at the Orlando Stadium on Tuesday evening.  The Buccaneers are currently occupying second position, having played 12 games, with four victories, six draws, two losses and just a single point behind Baroka FC who are on 19 points.  SuperSport United are playing catch up in the league, due to their involvement in the CAF Confederations Cup, where they reached the final and eventually lost out to DRC’s TP Mazembe in the final.  Both Pirates and SuperSport are fresh off 1-0 victories over Bloemfontein Celtic and Ajax Cape Town in the league, and will be looking to continue their winning momentum.  Goals have been a premium for both clubs, they’ve only scored nine goals each in the league, and the clash at the Orlando Stadium will provide an opportunity to improve that record.  In the other fixtures for Tuesday night, Mamelodi Sundowns take on leaders Baroka FC, and Cape Town City are in action against Maritzburg United. All games kick off at 19:30.
