                                         CAPE TOWN - The deputy police minister says commercial crimes are hindering the state from delivering services as it should. Bongani Mkongi adds current police IT systems need to be strengthened to better deal with well-resourced and sophisticated perpetrators who side-step the processes of state.  Mkongi was in Khayelitsha on Tuesday to introduce recently appointed Hawks head Judge Frans Kgomo to the community. The deputy minister says current systems are not tackling commercial crimes effectively. He says these crimes are eating away at state resources. “Paying the teachers and paying the nurses, we can’t pay our own police officers. The money is taken by white criminals and they are taking it outside our own country. We cannot do the development we need to.” He adds better resources are needed to strengthen policing systems. This includes the oversight role of Judge Kgomo, who was appointed as head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation in October.  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
