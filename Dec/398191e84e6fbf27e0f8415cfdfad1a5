                                         CAPE TOWN - Motherwell police have asked community members not to take the law into their own hands. This comes after 18-year old Lindo Kuhle was set alight by a group of about 120 New Brighton residents. The angry locals apparently believe Kuhle stabbed his mother to death on Thursday morning. Police are investigating both incidents. The police's Andre Beetge said, “Revenge attacks or mob justice can’t be tolerated, killing out of revenge will face the same consequences as murder.”
