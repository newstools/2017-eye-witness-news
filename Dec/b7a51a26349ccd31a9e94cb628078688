                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has received seven out of 10 for his performance with the Democratic Alliance labelling him the darling of Makhura’s cabinet. The opposition party on Thursday delivered its cabinet score card, rating Premier David Makhura and all his MECs.  The score is based on an MEC's performance, leadership skills, approachability, willingness to attend oversight committee meetings and oral reply’s in the legislature. Gauteng DA leader John Moodey says Lesufi outshines his counterparts. "He’s a darling of Gauteng provincial government. He’s an innovative MEC, who applies out of the box thinking to the challenges facing his department. "He’s often swift to respond to problems that are raised by the DA, although not always having the best solutions. He’s willing to enter into robust debate on the position." Moodey, however, rated Arts and Culture MEC Faith Mazibuko two out of 10.
