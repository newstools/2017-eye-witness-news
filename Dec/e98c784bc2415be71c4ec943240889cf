                                         CAPE TOWN - Metrorail and Prasa have launched a festive season safety campaign on the back of a week of cable theft, vandalism and disruptions. It’s the usual Friday morning peak with commuters heading to work. On the electronic scheduling board at the Cape Town Station, no delays or cancellations are shown, indicating an improved situation compared to the first three days of the week. The busy central line had to be shut down due to ongoing cable theft and vandalism. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker says security has been sharpened. “Of the criminals that come into our area and the recent attacks on our staff, we can only do repairs during daylight as well as under police or armed guards protection.” Several scrap dealers in the Netreg-Bonteheuwel area were arrested on Thursday after they were found in possession of stolen Metrorail goods.
