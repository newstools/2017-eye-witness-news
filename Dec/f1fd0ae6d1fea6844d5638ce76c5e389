                                         CAPE TOWN - Mayor Patricia de Lille won't have to stave off a motion of no confidence like her counterparts in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth had to, but she's expected to face an onslaught from the opposition amid corruption claims levelled against her by her closest aide. De Lille says she will be responding to the allegations at the final council meeting of the year on Tuesday. The African National Congress attempt to remove won't be put on the agenda because the party filed the paperwork too late. After six years in the job, De Lille is facing her toughest year as mayor. Her administration has come under fire for its delayed response to the drought. Then a public spat between her and Mayco member JP Smith over the closure of the city's Special Investigating Unit exposed political fractures within the Democratic Alliance’s city caucus. The matter remains unresolved and the pair is still suspended from party gatherings. Now De Lille also has to fend off claims from the executive director in her office, Craig Kesson, who she has been sweeping tender corruption under the carpet. “We operate within the systems and procedures of the city to make sure that the audi alteram partem rule applies where you can hear the other side of the story.” Council will also be considering whether to suspend Kesson and city transport head, Melissa Whitehead, who De ille is accused of protecting.
