                                         JOHANNESBURG - Journalist Jacques Pauw looks set to meet with police in the next few days after being summoned last week. It’s understood the author of The President’s Keepers was contacted by a KwaZulu-Natal police officer but no further details are available. The book made serious allegations against President Jacob Zuma and the Guptas, accusing Zuma of tax evasion. Pauw says that a Colonel Govender sent a letter requesting to urgently meet with him and journalist Pieter Louis Myburgh, the author of the book The Republic of the Guptas. It’s unclear why they have been summoned, and if charged, what the charges against them are. Pauw says the officer requested a meeting between Monday or Tuesday in Johannesburg or Durban. He says he suspects the complainant in this matter is linked to President Zuma. "I believe that the complainant is Roy Moodley, who’s a security tycoon in KwaZulu-Natal and close friend of Jacob Zuma." Pauw has reiterated that he is willing to cooperate with the police.
