                                         CAPE TOWN - Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown is keeping Zethembe Khoza as chairperson of Eskom’s board despite the controversy surrounding him. Khoza allegedly asked State Security Minister Bongani Bongo to derail the parliamentary inquiry into allegations of grand corruption at Eskom. He’s denied the allegations. Brown has shown she has confidence in Khoza who will remain Eskom chairperson until the company holds its annual general meeting in 2018. She says these arrangements provide continuity at a difficult time for the power utility. “The board and management must take strides within its control to address the internal control deficiencies and the finalisation of Eskom’s own internal investigations.” The new board comprises seven of the interim non-executive directors and two new ones. Brown says she'll be looking to business organisations to fill the four remaining vacant seats on the board. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
