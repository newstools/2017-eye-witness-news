                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation says its staff is struggling to come to terms with the death of the foundation’s member and struggle stalwart Laloo Chiba. The 87-year-old Robben Island prisoner died at his Lanesia home on Friday after he suffered a mild heart attack a few days ago. Chiba is being honoured at a memorial service in Lenasia. Family members, political heads including former president Kgalema Motlanthe, former ministers Pravin Gordhan and Derek Hanekom and the African National Congress’s (ANC) Jesse Duarte have gathered at the Nirvana Secondary School for Chiba’s memorial service.  The former Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) platoon commander served 18 years on Robben Island alongside former president Nelson Mandela. Hanekom, who worked close to Chiba before his death, could not contain his tears as he said his friend farewell. “Rest in peace. If anyone has deserved it, you have. You have done everything that you could possibly do in your life.” Members of various organisations who were impacted by the stalwart’s life are paying their respects. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
