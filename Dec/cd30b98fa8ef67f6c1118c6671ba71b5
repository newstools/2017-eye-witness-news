                                         JOHANNESBURG - Cricket South Africa (CSA) and the South African Cricketers' Association (SACA) have reached an agreement to compensate all the players that were due to play in the tournament in a three-installment payout plan.  The much-anticipated inaugural Global League T20 was due to start in November but was postponed in October this year, with the CSA board sighting reasons of insufficient time to prepare for the tournament.  Two weeks prior to the decision to postpone the GLT20, CSA and former Chief Executive Officer Haroon Lorgat parted ways and has seen Thabang Moroe being placed as CEO in the interim.  Though not confirmed by CSA, it is reported that the decision to postpone the tournament, was due to a lack of a lucrative broadcast deal, major sponsors and the tournament was expected to run at a loss.  CSA and SACA say a three-installment payout plan has been devised to compensate all the players that were due to play in the tournament. The installments will be paid out between December 2017 and April 2018.  Moroe has thanked SACA for the way they have dealt with the situation.  “I would like to thank SACA for the amicable way this issue was settled in the best interests of South African cricket and the sustainability of its development and international cricket programmes.”  Tony Irish, chief executive of SACA, says the postponement has affected 138 South African and foreign cricketers and is happy that the situation has been resolved in an amicable way.  “This was an issue affecting 138 South African and foreign players and we’re very happy that we’ve been able to resolve it for all of them.” The GLT20 is expected to commence in November 2018.
