                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town police say the man suspected of shooting dead his girlfriend in front of her parents has handed himself over to police. Unathi Sabsana was killed at New Crossroads in Gugulethu last week, two days after the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children Campaign was launched. Deputy Police Minister Bongani Mkongi has since visited Sabsana’s family to offer his condolences. The police’s Novela Potelwa says the alleged shooter handed himself over this weekend, knowing he would eventually get caught. “The suspect handed himself over to Gugulethu police on Saturday when he realised that the police were in hot pursuit. Detectives will oppose bail when the suspect appears in court on Monday on a murder charge.”
