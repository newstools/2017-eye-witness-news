                                         PRETORIA - International forces fighting jihadis in the Sahel are getting a festive treat from French President Emmanuel Macron. He's taking the chef from the Elysee Palace to cook a special meal for the soldiers from France, the United States, Canada and Germany. President Macron’s met his counterpart from Niger Mahamadou Issoufou. The African leader’s support for operation Barkane is vital as Macron wants more African support for the international force fighting people trafficking and terrorism. France itself has committed 3,000 troops; it’s largest military force deployed abroad. But for them and other Western soldiers to feel confident about going home, there has to be buy-in from the Africans and proof that they are committed to the fight against extremism.
