                                         JOHANNESBURG - Outspoken former African National Congress (ANC) MP Makhosi Khoza has officially launched her new political party called the African Democratic Change. Khoza resigned from the ANC and Parliament earlier this year after being targeted for speaking out against corruption within the governing party.  The new party is born out of a merger with civil society organisations and members from other political parties. Khoza has described her new party as a new force of change that will work to solve problems faced by South Africans, especially the poor. Khoza says the party will be built on ethical and moral leadership. She says the newly formed African Democratic Party doesnâ€™t belong to her and should be seen as a new political home for the people of South Africa.
