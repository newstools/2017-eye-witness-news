                                         PRETORIA - The High Court has ruled that the decision to withdraw criminal charges against deputy prosecutions boss Nomgcobo Jiba was based on a material error in law. A full bench in Pretoria reviewed and set aside advocate Shaun Abrahams's decision on Thursday. Jiba is facing charges of fraud and perjury for the unlawful authorisation of racketeering charges against former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Johan Booysen. The High Court rejected Advocate Abrahams’s reliance on a provision in the prevention of Organised Crime Act which absolves a person of liability if they exercise their powers in terms of the act in good faith. The court held that Jiba was not charged for exercising her powers in terms of the law, but rather for her conduct in a review application brought by general Booysen. It’s on this ground that the court ruled Abrahams's decision is based on a material error of law which falls short of the legality expected in a rational decision. The court has ordered President Jacob Zuma to institute disciplinary proceedings against Jiba and Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi after their General Council of the Bar appeal is concluded. At the same time, Freedom Under Law says it's delighted by a judgment against Jiba, who is now facing fraud and perjury charges. CEO of Freedom Under Law Nicole Fritz says this allows for an end to the instability at the National Prosecuting Authority. “We think this judgment, together with the [Mxolisi] Nxasana judgment, which was handed down two weeks ago also by the North Gauteng High Court, potentially allows for an end finally to the chronic instability that has fallen the NPA over the last decade.”
