                                         PRETORIA - The police’s National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structures (Natjoints) say they’re satisfied that all security measures are in place to secure the African National Congress (ANC)'s national conference at Nasrec, which starts this weekend. Thousands of delegates from across the country are converging on Johannesburg to elect the governing party’s new leaders. The so-called Natjoints and their counterparts in Gauteng say the structure will be operational 24 hours a day for the duration of the ANC conference. Their security plan will focus on venue, route, hotel and air security as well as crowd management. A similar plan was implemented during the party’s policy conference earlier this year. Gauteng’s three metro police departments will patrol main transport routes while the National Defence Force is expected to provide logistical, air support and rapid response in the event of an incident. Natjoints has encouraged delegates to conduct themselves responsibly. The structure has also called on leaders to refrain from making irresponsible or provocative statements or pronouncements which may incite such behaviour.
