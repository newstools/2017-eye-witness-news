                                         JOHANNESBURG - ANC's presidential hopeful Cyril Ramaphosa has reportedly rejected President Jacob Zuma's proposal to have the losing contender in the leadership race deputize. The City Press is reporting that Ramaphosa insists that the president's suggestion has never gained traction. After months of lobbying, the leadership election is scheduled to start at Nasrec on Saturday. According to the City Press, the deputy president says Zuma floated the idea of a deputising losing candidate at the policy conference earlier this year but that delegates didnâ€™t warm up to it. The paper quotes Ramaphosa as saying there was a sense that this should be left to branches as they are the custodians of democratic practices in the ANC. However, Ramaphosa has warned that the right for branches to elect their candidate is under threat, as they have been alerted of people being offered money in order to buy their votes. This comes after Mathews Phosa last week alleged that the Mpumalanga general conference had been marred by threats, intimidation and voter buying. Phosa has since approached the court to declare the conference void.
