                                         JOHANNESBURG – Speakers at the memorial services of struggle stalwart Laloo Chiba have described him as a humble and principled leader. The former uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) veteran died on Friday at his Lenasia home, south of Johannesburg, after suffering a mild heart attack a few days ago. African National Congress (ANC) leaders, community members, and the Chiba family have gathered at the nirvana secondary school for the stalwart’s memorial. Posters which read ‘Hamba kahle comrade Laloo Isu Chiba’ can be seen on the walls at the secondary school where people are paying their last respects to the stalwart. Former tourism minister Derek Hanekom told mourners that the struggle stalwart was a proud ANC member, but that the party he had fought for had now changed. “It was also the ANC of Oliver Tambo, Chris Hani, Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Uncle Kathy and Isu Chiba. But it is not the ANC that was the of those great leaders.” Community members who interacted with Chiba are lauding him as a wise and selfless person. The 87-year-old’s remains will be cremated at the Avalon cemetery. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
