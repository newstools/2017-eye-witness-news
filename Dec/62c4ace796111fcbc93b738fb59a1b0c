                                         JOHANNESBURG- The South African Rugby Union (Saru) said in a statement that they will not be making any decisions regarding the national coaching role until 2018. There has been widespread speculation regarding the future of Springbok coach Allister Coetzee after another underwhelming international season.  Coetzeeâ€™s performance as Springbok coach has been under fire since assuming the role in 2016.  In 2016 Coetzee had a dreadful year, as he recorded eight defeats from 13 games, including record defeats to New Zealand, Argentina and Italy. His record improved slightly in 2017, but humiliating defeats to New Zealand, Ireland and Wales have cast doubt over his Springbok future. During the end of year tour, it was reported that Coetzee could be returning to Japan to take up a head coaching position with the Canon Eagles, but he has since refuted speculation that he could be returning to the Japanese league.  The statement said that a number of meeting and reviews are in progress on all national teams and plans for all teams will be announced in 2018.
