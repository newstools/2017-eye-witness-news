                                         CAPE TOWN - The Cape Chamber of Commerce says government needs to think more like engineers to combat the ongoing drought. Chamber executive director, Sid Piemer says the crisis is because of short-term thinking by politicians. The City of Cape Town on Tuesday announced it will introduce level six water restrictions in January and seek to introduce a drought levy. Piemer says politicians are mainly interested in the here and now and election cycles. “Civil engineers, on the other hand, think differently, they design dams and bridges to last centuries and they think in terms of hundred-year flood plans.”
