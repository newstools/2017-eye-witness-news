                                         JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has taken a swipe at the judiciary, saying that some of the decisions it takes, like the recent National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) ruling, are unheard of. Zwane was speaking at the African National Congress’s Free State elective conference on Sunday night. The High Court in Pretoria ruled last week that the appointment of NPA head Shaun Abrahams was invalid, ordering him to vacate office and for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint his successor within 60 days. The court said that President Jacob Zuma is clearly conflicted when it comes to the appointment of prosecutions bosses and that he would likely make an appointment to escape his fraud and corruption charges.  But Zwane has raised concerns with the judiciary. "There are these issues that are taking now of late that we can’t understand. For the president can’t perform his own functions which he is elected for. That’s unheard of."
