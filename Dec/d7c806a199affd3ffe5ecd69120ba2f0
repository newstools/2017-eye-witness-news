                                         JOHANNESBURG - National executive committee member Bheki Cele says it’s too late for the African National Congress (ANC) to advocate for an uncontested united slate, saying even President Jacob Zuma  must take some blame for the problems facing the party before talking about unity. The deputy minister spoke to Eyewitness News on Tuesday ahead of the party’s elective conference this weekend. There are last-ditch attempts by supporters of two the ANC’s two presidential candidates Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma  and Cyril Ramaphosa  to agree on a united slate that may represent both factions. Cele, who has campaigned for Ramaphosa, says it’s a little too late. “It hasn’t happened and I guess it’s too late now so looking at present candidates we think Cyril can give us the best outcomes when it comes to the ANC going forward.” He’s questioned Zuma’s efforts to unify presidential candidates. “I don’t think many people will take him seriously if he doesn’t put some kind of blame on him before he calls for the unity.” Cele also says he will not be surprised if someone tries to interdict the conference this weekend.
