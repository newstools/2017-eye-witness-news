                                         JOHANNESBURG- Cape Town club Ajax Cape Town, announced the resigning of Muhsin Ertugral as the club’s head coach with immediate effect, following the sacking of Dutch coach Stanley Menzo on Thursday. Menzo and Ajax Cape Town reached a mutual agreement to part ways, having had a year-long relationship that didn’t yield any fruitful results. Ajax find themselves languishing in 15th position on the log, with only three wins from 14 matches and 13 points. The club has since seen it fit to bring back Ertugral for a fourth stint with the club, having spent time as Ajax head coach in 2006, 2009, 2013. Ertugral’s last job in South Africa was with Soweto giants Orlando Pirates, which ended in unceremonious fashion when Ertugral resigned after a 6-0 drubbing at the hands of SuperSport United.  Ajax Chief Executive Ari Efstathiou says that Ertugral’s reappointment is about saving the club and the Turkish national has always enjoyed great success with the club.  “The bottom line is that Muhsin has always enjoyed success with the club, and every time that he has left it has always been about situation. The last time he left here was because of a personal issue. We have always promoted players from the academy under Muhsin.” Ertugral and Ajax’s first assignment will come in the new year when they take on Maritzburg United on 5 January at the Cape Town Stadium.
