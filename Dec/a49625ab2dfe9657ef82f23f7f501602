                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) says it's still deliberating on whether to investigate MultiChoice over allegations that it paid news channels for influence over the digital migration saga. Last week, the Democratic Alliance revealed that minutes from an SABC board meeting show that MultiChoice  sought to pay the national broadcaster R100 million allegedly in exchange for its influence over government's position on set-top boxes. The opposition party says this supports allegations that ANN7 was also paid by MultiChoice for similar influence. Icasa's Paseka Maleka said: “We have received a letter from the DA but we currently don’t have a position because council is still deliberating on the issue, as soon as we have a considered view, it is then that we will be able to explain if there will be an investigation or not.”-
