                                            Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt is optimistic about his team’s chances ahead of the Telkom Knockout final against Bloemfontein Celtic in Durban on Saturday.
                                         JOHANNESBURG- Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt says that the return of key players for the Telkom Knockout final bodes well for his team's chances on Saturday.  The Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu will host the 12th edition of the cup competition final and Hunt says that he is happy to have some of his key players back for the final.  “We have a few guys back now. Most of this season, the team picked itself, now I have to sit down and pick a team. It’s also the first team in 16 games we have the whole defence fit, so it’s good,” says Hunt.  Though Hunt is optimistic, he isn’t underestimating Bloemfontein Celtic.  "It’s about doing the little things right and if both teams can do that, they’re in with a good chance. They are also going to be as determined as we are, so we have to play well.”  Defender Buhle Mkhwanazi also emphasised his coach’s sentiments about returning players.  Mkhwanazi says that having captain Thulani Hlatshwayo back from injury bodes well for their defence.  “The centre back partnership is very vital and keeping a clean sheet means you get to win something. Having Thulani back is good for the team,” says Mkhwanazi. The Telkom Knockout Final kicks off at 6pm at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday.
