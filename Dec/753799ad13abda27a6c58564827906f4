The International Monetary Fund says it will be sending its officials to Zimbabwe to help the country in its efforts to design policies to revive the economy. JOHANNESBURG - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it will be sending its officials to Zimbabwe to help the country in its efforts to design policies to revive the economy. The IMF says it will be working closely with the country which has been isolated and unable to borrow money from the IMF. The IMF says it stands ready to assist the Zimbabwean authorities. “The new president (Emmerson Mnangagwa) is putting in place his Cabinet and we stand ready to work closely with the country and the staff should help us to make progress in that direction.” The regular staff visit to Harare in early December “will update our assessment of Zimbabwe’s fiscal position, foreign exchange developments and inquire about the new administration’s economic plans,” IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said. Zimbabwe’s new president Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday appointed a new acting finance minister and announced a three-month amnesty window for the return of public funds illegally stashed abroad by individuals and companies. Just a week in office, Mnangagwa, has promised to tackle corruption that had become endemic under former president Robert Mugabe’s 37-year rule.
