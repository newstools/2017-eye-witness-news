                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) and the South African Revenue Service (Sars) are set to release the Tax Statistics Bulletin for 2017, indicating whether they reached their targets. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced in his medium-term budget speech a shortfall of about R50 billion. He was criticised in a number of quarters over tax collection. Sars will release the statistics bulletin, which will give the exact details on targets for revenue collection. The bulletin will also give an indication of various tax streams including personal income, company income and value added tax. Last year saw a decline in contributions to company income tax, however, an increase in personal income tax made up for the shortfall. Sars exceeded its target of R1 trillion in revenue collection last year. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
