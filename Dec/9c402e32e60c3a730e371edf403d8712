                                         JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the 10-point action plan he presented will focus on job creation and transformation. He was speaking on 702’s Kariba Brown Shown on Thursday night. He says the plan is to get everyone involved in creating jobs for South African citizens. “It is not a new policy, it is a mechanism to get us to focus and I identified 10 issues and we can focus on them in a smart way. For instance, the first one is jobs; I’m suggesting that is we can get all key role-players to agree that we’re going to create a million jobs because all we need to do is to get them together around a table and say what are you going to do to get us to create those jobs? If we can do that, that is a deal in itself.”
