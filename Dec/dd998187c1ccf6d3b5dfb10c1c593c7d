                                         JOHANNESBURG - Suspended Gauteng Health head of department Dr Barney Selebano is expected to find out on Monday morning whether he will be forced to testify at the Esidimeni Arbitration hearings.  Selebano will be appearing in the High Court in Johannesburg today.  He played a key role in the marathon project in which 143 psychiatric patients died.  Judge Daniel Berger will make his decision known this morning on whether or not he will grant Selebano a reprieve from testifying at the Life Esidimeni hearings.  Selebano is fighting a subpoena issued to him by the State.  His lawyer, Craig Watt-Pringle, argued last week that his client is being subjected to a commission of inquiry and not an arbitration hearing.  Watt-Pringle says that there is no dispute because the government has already said that it takes full responsibility for the deaths of 143 mentally ill people. If he was able to convince Judge Berger to declare that the process is not an arbitration, it would mean that none of the involved parties have the right to subpoena Selebano under the Arbitration Act.
