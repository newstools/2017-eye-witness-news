The national investigation unit received a tip off on Sunday night about a group of men targeting travellers from OR Tambo International Airport. Officers spotted the men on the N3 highway travelling in a stolen car and a shootout followed.  The police's Vishnu Naidoo says: “Two firearms were recovered. That vehicle that the suspects were using was reported hijacked in the Norwood area in October this year and that vehicle was also recovered. “The suspects that were arrested now facing charges of being unlawfully in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, armed robbery with all the things that were discovered from them.”
