                                         LONDON - Clashes have broken out between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops across the West Bank over American president Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. It comes as Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu joins a chorus of international leaders who have denounced the American president's comments. He says God is weeping over what he says is American President Donald Trump's inflammatory and discriminatory recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Tutu says it is our responsibility to tell Trump that he is wrong. His comments come as violent protests erupt in the Palestinian cities of Ramallah, Bethlehem and Hebron, where Israeli security forces fired teargas and plastic-coated rounds as hundreds of protesters threw stones and set alight barricades. A fresh round of violent protests is expected on Friday at mass demonstrations called to follow Friday prayers.
