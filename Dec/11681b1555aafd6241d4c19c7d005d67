                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Human Rights Commission says it’s received a letter from the vice-chancellor of the University of South Africa (Unisa), asking it to intervene and deal with allegations of racism, sexism, and harassment at its Law College. The commission says its concerning that such claims are coming from such a distinguished institution of higher learning. Gauteng provincial manager Buang Jones said: “It’s quite disappointing but we hope that through this investigation we’ll be able to find a lasting resolution to the challenges that the university faces. We hope our interventions will yield the necessary and desired results.”
