                                         CAPE TOWN - A Rhodes University activist expelled for life for her actions during a protest against rape culture  on campus will turn to the courts. Two students banned last month have now been banned for life. It's understood they were part a group of female students which publicly identified four male students suspected of rape and allegedly dragged those suspects out of their dorm rooms. The Socio-Economic Rights Institute  represents Yolanda Dyantyi, one of the students sanctioned. The institute's Nomzamo Zondo says they deem the sanction as harsh and unreasonable. “They sanctioned Yolanda and the other student, probably the most severe sanction that has been given by the university in the last seven years. In this year alone there were students who were found guilty of rape, but those students were expelled for 10 years.” Zondo says they'll fight the ban. “The university has sanctioned her in a way that closed any hope that she has of a bright future.” Meanwhile, Rhodes University says the expulsions are not related to the right to demonstrate, saying the two have been sanctioned for committing acts of criminality and violating the rights and liberties of others.
