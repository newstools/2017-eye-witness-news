                                         CAPE TOWN - Plett Rage has given the Plettenberg Bay area a financial injection of up to R40 to R50 million. This year about 4,000 matriculants are attending the annual end-of-year party bash in the seaside town. Plettenberg Bay Tourism says this number is lower than the previous years. Plett Rage spokesperson Ronen Klugman says the event, which comes to an end on 8 December, has been a success so far. “We’ve also invested quite a bit more in terms of our security. We always believe it’s a big focus. We’ve got a wonderful transport solution that’s been running brilliantly. We’ve got triple amount of volunteers from around the Plettenberg Bay community that have been making sure that the students are getting home safely.”
