                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) electoral commission chair Sindiso Mfenyana says it’s important that the power of the ruling party’s branches is recognised and respected within the party. Mfenyana was speaking at the Gauteng ANC provincial council on Saturday night. At the meeting, the provincial structure announced Cyril Ramphosa as its preferred candidate after he received 374 branch nominations. Ramaphosa's rival Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma came in second with 64 nominations.Mfenyana says the electoral commission has put measures in place so branches no longer feel ignored by larger party structures. “When we sing, we sing songs that say the power is within the branches and then go on to ignore them. So, we wanted to make sure that this time the branches will feel that their power is recognised and respected.”
