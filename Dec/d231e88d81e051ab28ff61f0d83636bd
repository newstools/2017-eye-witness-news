                                         CAPE TOWN – A non-profit organisation is expanding its food garden initiative to feed more learners in needy communities in the Western Cape. Call 2 Care's iGardi Project allows schools to cultivate their own water-wise fruit and vegetable gardens. There are 60 gardens catering for 3,500 learners. Learners are encouraged to lend a hand in tending the gardens, which are also used as educational tools in science and economics lessons. Call 2 Care founder Alex Audagnotti said: “We plan on implementing more next year and there’s holding plans to implement another 25 gardens this year on top of the 36 that we’ve already sponsored. We’ve got a lot in the pipeline and it’s exciting.”
