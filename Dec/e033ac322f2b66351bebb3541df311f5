                                         CAPE TOWN - Bitcoin has on Wednesday leapt above the $12,000 mark for the first time. It takes the virtual currency’s gains since the start of the year to over 1,100%. Bitcoin has crashed through a series of milestones in recent weeks despite warnings of a potential bubble. After starting the year below $1,000, it hit $8,000 for the first time in November and topped 11,000 last week. Bitcoin’s moves dwarfed any traditional currency's once again, with the cryptocurrency hitting a new record high of more than $12,500, up almost 7% on the day. It is on track for its strongest quarter since 2013 after almost tripling in price since the start of October. Additional reporting by Reuters.
