                                         JOHANNESBURG - Outside the African National Congress national conference, street vendors have been instructed by Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers to leave the area or else they will be forced to move. Visibly angry street vendors say the JMPD officers are being unfair and have even lashed out against Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba, saying he is xenophobic. “Poor South Africans, we are just here for four days. Only for the conference. Just making our kids' money, to buy food and Christmas things.” The JMPD has confirmed that according to by-laws, the vendors are not supposed to be trading there. Some women have now packed up trying to relocate as soon as possible while others stand firm, refusing to move.
