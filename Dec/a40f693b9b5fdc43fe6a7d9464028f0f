                                         JOHANNESBURG- England opening batsman, Alastair Cook is set to play in a record 150th Test match for his country, but says the behavior of the England players in Australia has been widely blown out of proportion in the media.  Cook started his career as a fresh-faced 21-year-old against India in Nagpur, where he scored a century on debut, and 11 years later, Cook is England cricket’s leading run scorer in test match cricket with 11,691 runs.  Cook has also captained England, and during his tenure as the leader of England cricket, he established himself as a leader with great integrity and led from the front with the bat. Though the third Ashes test match at the WACA will be an emotionally filled occasion for Cook, it is also the last test match that the venue will host.  Cook says that milestone is a proud moment in his career and one that he will cherish for a long time.  “When I turned up in Nagpur all those years ago, I didn’t think I would be here now but playing 150 test matches is a proud achievement, and not a lot of people get to play 150 test matches, especially at the top of the order.” Cook also says the events of the past few months surrounding their behavior as cricketers haven’t been good but maintains that some of them have been blown out of proportion.  “It’s sad and ever since the [Ben] Stokes incident in September, we have been a different team but some of the events have been made to seem bigger than what they really are.”  England will be looking to stay alive in the series as they currently trail Australia 2-0 in the five-match series.
