                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan says the North Gauteng High Court’s ruling is again an indication that state capture and corruption is a reality in South Africa. The High Court ruled on Wednesday that President Jacob Zuma had no justifiable basis to ignore the impact of state capture and object to the Public Protector’s remedial action to address the problem. Zuma has been ordered to appoint a state capture inquiry within 30 days and to personally foot the bill for all the legal costs. Gordhan says public officials have a choice to do right by country’s citizens. “Given a choice, we can either carry on with impurity thinking that the situation will last forever, or we begin to realise that change is around the corner. That change is going to negatively impact both individuals and collectives, and give us an opportunity to step onto the right side.” Meanwhile, the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services in Parliament has welcomed the judgement. In a statement released on Wednesday evening committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga says this assures the nation that there will be an independent judiciary that will uphold the constitution and the rule of law.
