                                         JOHANNESBURG - A trio of Proteas stalwarts in AB de Villiers, Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander have been included in the South African Test squad for the one-off day-night Test match against Zimbabwe starting on Boxing Day in Port Elizabeth.  De Villiers makes a return to the Test squad after recently availing himself for Test selection again after missing numerous series when he decided to take a break from the longer format of the game.  Steyn is included for the first time almost almost a year out with a shoulder injury he sustained on the tour of Australia last November. The veteran bowler has played domestic Twenty20 cricket in the T20 Challenge recently and chief selector Linda Zondi believes that Steyn is ready to play Test cricket again.  “It is a very exciting moment, not just for South Africa, but for world cricket to have Dale and AB, two icons of the game, back in the multi-day format.” The 34-year-old Steyn will have the opportunity to overtake Shaun Pollock as South Africa’s leading wicket taker in Test match cricket this summer. Steyn currently has 417 wickets and is just four wickets shy of Pollock’s 421 wickets. Vernon Philander also is back in the squad after missing the recently concluded series against Bangladesh due to an injury he picked up on the tour to the UK in the winter.  Proteas squad: Faf du Plessis (captain), Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma ,Quinton de Kock (wicketkeeper), Theunis de Bruyn, AB de Villiers, Dean Elgar, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, Morne Morkel, Andile Phehlukwayo, Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn
