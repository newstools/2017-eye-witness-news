                                         JOHANNESBURG - Woolworths has announced that it's removed a range of children's T-shirts from its shelves because the pom-pom trims are made of animal fur. The company says it initiated a recall as soon as it became aware of the problem because the retailer's policies ban the use of animal fur. Woolworths says it's committed to animal welfare and believes it's the company's ethical obligation to ensure animals are treated humanely. The retailer says its animal welfare policies form part of contractual agreements with suppliers. In this case, the supplier purchased fur from a third party without testing whether the fibre was synthetic or not. The recall applies to three T-shirts with fluffy pom-pom trims. About 1,276 have already been sold.
