The school governing body claims the Gauteng Education Department has been made aware of the problem. JOHANNESBURG - Parents are protesting outside the Bryneven Primary School in Bryanston on Tuesday morning, demanding the removal of the principal. They're accusing the principal of mismanaging funds and bullying teachers. Their representative Philippa da Costa says: “The parents have had enough and we want her out immediately and we’re protesting today out here in the rain.” Dominque Wolf has two children in the school and says she’s concerned about their future. “We need to see a change and show solidarity, that's we're doing here today. The things she wants to implement are absolutely ludicrous.” The school governing body claims the Gauteng Education Department has been made aware of the problem. MEC Panyaza Lesufi is aware of the protest and says he's looking into the allegations.
