                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police have been deployed around the Noordgesig Primary School ahead of a meeting between the Gauteng Education Department and the Soweto community over the appointment of a new principal. At the heart of the protest is the principal's race, which the community says is not reflective of them. One parent says: “If you go to an African school, you won’t find a coloured principal in their schools. It’s only Africans strictly.”  On Monday morning, the provincial department's spokesperson Steve Mabona says they need to sort out the matter before school closes for the year.  “We must be very clear on what we want. We rush into saying we are not racist but raise a race issue. People need to become clear on what they’re complaining about.” On Friday, learning was disrupted by protesting parents, saying the appointment was imposed on them.  But the department maintains it received approval from the school governing body.
