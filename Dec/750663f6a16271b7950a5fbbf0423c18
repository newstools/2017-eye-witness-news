JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department says it's concerned by reports of children who commit suicide after failing the academic year. A Soshanguve pupil took his own life after discovering that he had failed grade 11. The South African Depression and Anxiety Group says it expects a spike in suicide attempts as young people receive their end-of-year results. The department's Steve Mabona is urging pupils to use their support programmes. “There are multiple options with the department when you don’t pass. Don’t choose the option of suicide.” The department is working together with organisations, such as Lifeline, to support learners who may be battling depression and anxiety.
