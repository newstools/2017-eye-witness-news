                                         JOHANNESBURG - There’s more than usual interest in the outcome of the elections of the African National Congress’ (ANC) extended national leadership because it will reveal the balance of power in the party. Vote-counting has concluded in the elections for the 80 new members of the party’s NEC. Lists have been circulating on social media for the preferred candidates of both the Cyril Ramaphosa and the Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma camp. A list purporting to reflect Ramaphosa’s top picks includes former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his ex-deputy Mcebisi Jonas, both vocal opponents of state capture.  Current Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s name is nowhere to be found, but it does crop up on two lists circulating that are said to be the Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma camp’s slate for the conference. Bathabile Dlamini, Faith Muthambi and Jeff Radebe are among serving ministers high up on that list, with Cabinet colleagues Nomvula Mokonyane and Fikile Mbalula lower down.
