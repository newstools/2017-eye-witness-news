                                         CAPE TOWN - A ward councillor in the Northern Cape has been suspended over a social media post that went viral. Ockert Fourie posted his frustration towards bikers on Facebook. In Afrikaans, he wrote: “When they rev their engines I wish to see pieces of steal, intestines, blood and brain cells on the road.” The Democratic Alliance's Andrew Louw says the party condemns Fourie's statement. “A lot of people, especially the bikers’ community, are completely disgruntled on the utterances of councillor Fourie. As the DA in the province, we distance ourselves completely.”
