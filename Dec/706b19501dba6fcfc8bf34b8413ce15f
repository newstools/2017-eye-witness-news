                                         JOHANNESBURG - Cosatu says unions must fight harder during wage negotiations to get better salary adjustments for workers after President Jacob Zuma  approved a salary hike of up to 8% for public office bearers. Zuma on Thursday accepted the recommendations of the Independent Commission for Remuneration of Public Office Bearers, which suggested an increase of members of Parliament and other officials. The president will now earn nearly R3 million, up from R2.8 million.  The economy has been battling to recover, with Treasury making calls to department to tighten the belt. Cosatu's Sizwe Pamla says that government can no longer tell workers that there is not enough money. “What have they done for the people of South Africa, particularly the workers? We are sitting with unemployment and an economy that’s haemorrhaging jobs.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
