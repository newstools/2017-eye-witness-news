                                         CAPE TOWN - The United National Transport Union (Untu) and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) have agreed to work on a comprehensive plan to ensure the safety of employees on the rail network. Untu says the plan will be announced on 8 January. The union says it recently met with Prasa to discuss ways to stabilise the passenger rail service in the Western Cape. Services on the Central Line between Cape Town and Khayelitsha have been thrown into disarray due to ongoing vandalism, cable theft and attacks on Prasa employees. Untu's Steve Harris says its job is to ensure workers are able to operate in a safe environment. Last month, a Metrorail  protection service officer was shot while on patrol in the Bonteheuwel-Netreg area. The father of two, who's been working for Prasa for seven years, has had to undergo surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his liver.
