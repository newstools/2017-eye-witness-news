                                         CAPE TOWN – The South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) says it will have 24-hour support services available for those struggling to manage substance abuse during the festive season. The organisation says many people often turn to alcohol, drugs and prescription pills to help them cope with various issues, and for enjoyment, especially during the holiday period. Sadag’s Dessy Tzoneva says the consequences are not worth it. “If we use a certain substance and the short-term effect is that maybe we feel less intense emotion and less anxiety, but that effect is normally very short-lived and thereafter actually – for example alcohol – it makes us feel more depressed. Certain substances can make us feel worse.” She adds South Africa's ranked among the top 10 countries with alcohol and narcotics abusers worldwide. The helpline number is 0800 12 13 14.
