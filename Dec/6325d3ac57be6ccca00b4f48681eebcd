Xolisa and Athabile Mafilika were arrested shortly after the young woman's body was found in a communal toilet in Khayelitsha in March last year. CAPE TOWN - Two cousins accused of the rape and murder of 19-year-old Sinoxolo Mafevuka in Khayelitsha have been found not guilty. Xolisa and Athabile Mafilika were arrested shortly after the young woman's body was found in a communal toilet in SST Block in March last year. She'd been strangled to death. The Mafilika cousins have been acquitted on charges of rape and murder in the Western Cape High Court. Judge Taswell Papier found the evidence presented to the court was of poor quality and the state failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the cousins were responsible for Mafevuka's rape and murder. He says no reasonable court can convict upon the evidence. No fingerprint or DNA evidence linked the accused to the young woman's death and the State relied principally on circumstantial evidence gathered from several witnesses.
