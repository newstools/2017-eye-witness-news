Police in the area have vowed to intensify police visibility during the festive season and the four recent arrests form part of this plan.  One man was arrested at a house in Kamesh, for the illegal possession of dagga on Thursday.   Officers targeted the house after receiving countless complaints from community members about the frequent drug activity on the premises.  Two other suspects were arrested at a supermarket later that day for the illegal possession of ammunition, while another suspect was arrested for being in possession of tik.  The police's Gerda Swart said: “The suspects will appear in Uitenhage Magistrates Court on various charges on Monday.”
