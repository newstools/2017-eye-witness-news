                                         JOHANNESBURG- English Premiership Rugby club Gloucester says they will support head coach Johan Ackermann and his son Ruan, in an investigation over an assault incident that took place in a Cheltenham pub on Sunday morning.  Gloucester, who are second on the Premiership log, were fresh from a 69-12 mauling of Italian side Zebre in the European Challenge Cup, when the incident happened in the early hours of Sunday morning.  It is alleged that Johan and Ruan Ackermann were involved in a scuffle that left a man with facial injuries. The man’s injuries were posted on social media by his sister, alleging that the Ackermann’s had assaulted her brother.  However, the Ackermann’s employers, Gloucester, have released a statement stating that they will investigate the incident, but they stand by the South African duo. Gloucester CEO Stephen Vaughan said that the club is aware of the incident and will be investigating.  "Gloucester Rugby takes any allegations extremely seriously and we have conducted a full investigation in to this matter. "Having spoken to Johan, Ruan, the club where the alleged incident took place, the police and other independent witnesses as well as viewing subsequent CCTV footage, I am completely satisfied that whilst an incident did take place, it was instigated by others and not by Johan and Ruan as has been incorrectly reported. "Both Johan and Ruan have been upset and disappointed by the allegations, but do appreciate the support from Gloucester Rugby fans, players, colleagues, friends and family." Johan Ackermann, coached the Lions to two back to back Super Rugby finals in 2016 and 2017.
