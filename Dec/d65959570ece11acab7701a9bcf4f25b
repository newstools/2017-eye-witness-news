                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police have found more than 200 bullets in the Sandton office of a banking official accused of killing his wife. Manuela Pietropaolo was shot nine times at her Brockenhurst house in Alberton three weeks ago. Her estranged husband and treasurer at the Bank of Athens, Enzo Pietropaolo, allegedly tried to flee to Italy after the crime. Pietropaolo will be applying for bail on Friday, just days after evidence was collected from his office at the Bank of Athens in Sandton. The bank was contacted by Eyewitness News but refused to comment on the new evidence. Police also found two firearms in Pietropaoloâ€™s possession at his house in Randburg in November. Security guards, who were first on the scene, claim all his clothes had been packed and he was ready to leave, presumably for his home country, Italy. Evidence found on the scene also indicates that the accused may have used gloves to clean his firearms with chemicals after the crime. The state is expected to oppose his bail application in the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court on Friday. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
