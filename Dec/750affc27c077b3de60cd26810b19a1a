                                         CAPE TOWN - Reaction is continuing to pour in following the African National Congress (ANC)'s decision to downgrade the South African embassy in Israel. The Congress of the People (Cope) has described it as myopic, saying that it will have devastating consequences. The ANC resolved at its conference, which wrapped up early on Thursday morning, to downgrade the embassy to a liaison office. Cope adds that it won't contribute towards resolving the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. Spokesperson Dirat-Sagae Kganare: "Let's say Israel responds in kind, then we have to go to Kenya to get a visa."
