                                         JOHANNESBURG - A man accused of attempting to murder Amcu branch leader Malibongwe Mdazo is expected to appear for bail in the Brits Magistrates Court on Friday.  Samkelo Mkhutshwa allegedly shot and wounded Mdazo in Mooinooi near Brits in July. Eyewitness News earlier revealed that recent killings in the area are linked to the associationâ€™s resistance against new leadership. At least six Amcu leaders have been killed execution-style since July. It is understood that Mkhutshwa was arrested in the beginning of this month in the Eastern Cape in connection with another attempted murder in the North West in September. He was released on bail but was then arrested for the latest incident. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
