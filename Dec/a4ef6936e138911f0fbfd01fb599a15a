                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it’s still waiting for a response from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) to the party’s request for an investigation into allegations of corruption by MultiChoice. It’s the latest statement since the party released minutes of a South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board meeting that revealed how MultiChoice offered to pay the public broadcaster R100 million in exchange for political influence on digital migration. Naspers chairperson Koos Bekker has denied that anything untoward took place. Countries worldwide have a 2019 deadline to migrate to digital technology. The DA’s Phumzile van Damme says: "The DA has referred this matter to Icasa for thorough investigation. We believe that Icasa must absolutely look into this matter and take a clear stand against what appears to be seriously unethical conduct by a company that it regulates."
