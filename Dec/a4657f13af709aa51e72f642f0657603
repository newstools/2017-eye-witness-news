                                         CAPE TOWN - A second clinical trial to assess the efficacy of an experimental HIV vaccine has been rolled out in Sub-Saharan Africa. This experiment sets out to gauge whether the vaccine regimen is safe and able to prevent HIV infection. Results for this experiment are expected by 2021. The new Phase 2b study, called Imbokodo, will enrol 2,600 HIV-negative women in Sub-Saharan Africa between the ages of 18 and 35. The vaccine will be implemented at clinical trial sites through a private-public collaboration. South African Medical Research Council Professor Glenda Gray says 43% of 1.8 million new HIV infections globally occurred in eastern and southern Africa. “We want to make a vaccine that has a global impact, not just a vaccine that may only have an impact in a specific region.” Two HIV vaccine efficacy trials are currently being rolled out.
