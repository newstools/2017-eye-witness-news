                                         JOHANNESBURG - Keenan Davidse goes into the second round of the Joburg Open with a one shot lead after his opening round of 8 under par 63 at the Randpark Golf Club on Thursday.  Three other South Africans are tied for second place on 7 under, while two more are a further shot behind. Davidse says it was a satisfactory round, and he was surprised about his efforts.  “I’m very relieved, I had a lot of pressure this week but I know God was looking over me today. He showed me a sign this morning and I just went out there and did what I had to do.”
