                                         CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu's office has come down hard on Mervyn Dirks, a day after he allegedly insulted a party colleague. The ANC in Parliament says Dirks's behaviour was "despicable" and should not go unpunished. The party has now asked Luthuli House to take disciplinary steps against him. Priscilla Mantashe has confirmed to Eyewitness News Dirks launched into a tirade, insulting members of her family during a sitting of the National Assembly on Thursday. “I can’t give sanction myself, that will depend on the person who is going to deal with this matter. But I want a punishment that will make him refrain from being rude.” ANC spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli says the Speaker has been asked to investigate the matter. “We’ve also written to the secretary general of the ANC to institute disciplinary hearings against this matter.” On Thursday, Dirks denied he had done anything wrong and he was eventually asked to leave the House after he'd showed the middle finger to the Democratic Alliance.
