                                         JOHANNESBURG - Universities South Africa says it's decided to cap fees at 8% for the 2018 academic year. The body announced earlier on Thursday that fees will be hiked in line with inflation. Last month President Jacob Zuma  released the findings of the Heher Commission, which was tasked with investigating the feasibility of free higher education in South Africa. It found that fee-free education is not viable at this stage and recommended that other funding models be utilised. Universities South Africa says it simply cannot wait any longer for Zuma to make a pronouncement on the future. Its CEO Ahmed Bawa said: “With regard to whether we’re going to have a fee system or not in 2018, but it’s already too late, and universities have to start budgeting so that they can start procuring things for 2018.”
