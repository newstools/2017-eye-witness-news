                                         JOHANNESBURG - India’s stand-in captain Rohit Sharma scored a record third One Day International double century as India beat Sri Lanka by 141 runs in the second ODI in Mohali on Wednesday.  Batting first India posted a mammoth 392 for 4 in their allotted 50 overs at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium.  The opening pair of Shikar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma shared in a 115-run opening stand before the former held out at short mid-wicket off the bowling of Sachith Pathirana for 68.  Then it was the Sharma show, and with an able partner in Shreyas Iyer accelerated the scoring for the Indians.  Sharma brought up his 16th ODI hundred, and in the process leapfrogged Virender Sehwag into fourth place in the most hundreds made by Indian batsmen. Sharma was most severe on Nuwan Pradeep who finished with figures of 0-106.  Sharma brought up his third ODI double century and became the first batsman to record three double centuries in ODI cricket.  Sri Lanka’s reply never got going as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah started the rot by removing the opening pair of Upul Tharanga and Gunathilaka before 18-year-old debutant Washington Sundar removed Lahiru Thirimanne.  All-rounder Angelo Matthews was the only shining light in a dismal Sri Lankan batting performance with a fighting 111 not out.  Sri Lanka eventually finished their innings on 251 for 8 in 50 overs. The victory for India ties the series at 1 all with the final ODI scheduled for Sunday 17 December at Visakhapatnam.
