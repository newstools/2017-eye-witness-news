                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former African National Congress (ANC) NEC member Lindiwe Zulu has refused to answer questions about state capture. She was speaking to journalists at the party’s 54th national conference on Tuesday at Nasrec in Johannesburg. Zulu was asked what she thinks the approach of the new top six toward state capture should be and whether she agrees that it is a serious problem. She said: “I’m not commenting on that because now I’m not dealing with state capture. That issue cannot be discussed by me here, it is going to be dealt with by the congress.” Zulu says branches must decide if they want to discuss state capture. “If that’s an issue for the branches, they will raise it there.” The ANC has identified state capture as a major problem for the party and the country and has resolved that a judicial inquiry will investigate. But President Jacob Zuma has denied that it exists.
