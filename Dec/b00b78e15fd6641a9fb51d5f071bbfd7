                                         JOHANNESBURG - It's understood that President Jacob Zuma is seeking leave to appeal the state capture ruling. Earlier this month, the High Court found that none of the grounds of review of Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report has any merit and, therefore, Zuma is not entitled to the review he seeks. Now, Zuma’s lawyers are seeking leave to appeal on all 20 grounds, including arguments that the court was wrong to order him to personally pay for legal costs. Zuma's lawyers are arguing that the High Court was wrong to say he was ill-advised to challenge advocate Madonsela's report. They say the Constitutional Court has stated that government should approach the courts when there is uncertainty over the Public Protector's remedial action. Zuma's legal team is also arguing that the court was wrong to find that he was too conflicted to appoint a judge to oversee the state capture inquiry. However, judge Dunstan Mlambo had ruled that the president was reckless to launch this review, adding that his court challenges had delayed the resolution of state capture allegations. “The review application was a clear nonstarter and the president was seriously reckless in pursuing it as he has done. His conduct falls far short of the high standard expressed in Section 195 of the Constitution.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
