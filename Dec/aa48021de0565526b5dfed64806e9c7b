                                         MBOMBELA - Several African National Congress (ANC) branches in Mpumalanga have gathered outside the provincial offices in Mbombela demanding answers as to why some names have been removed from the list of delegates for the elective conference next week. It follows allegations that the provincial office has manipulated the list in favour of presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. Brian Zondo says as the elective conference draws closer, disputes from his branch and several others have not been attended to by the provincial executive committee (PEC). “We’re frustrated but we’ll wait because we need answers.” He also gave a list of some of those concerns. “Change of delegates and those that appear on the list are not the rightfully nominated delegates.” Zondo says besides the 16 branch leaders present, there are others whose grievances have not been attended to. The PEC has been locked in a meeting at a lodge outside Mbombela since Friday morning with chairperson David Mabuza in attendance. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
