                                         UMLAZI - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says officers will work towards building trust with Glebelands residents to root out thugs living at the hostel. Mbalula was speaking at the Umlazi residence on Friday where he launched a satellite police station in response to the high level of killings.  At least 95 murders have been linked to hitmen who are believed to live at Glebelands.  Questions have been raised about how effective the satellite police station will be if Glebelands residents continue to fear speaking out. The hostel has become infamous for allegedly harbouring hitmen who have also been linked to other political assassinations in KZN. Mbalula says a different operational strategy will be used at this particular station. “First we need to have up-to-date tactical response teams so that we’re able to respond at any time. But over and above that we should ensure that even our police are secured whenever they execute the mission.” The station is a reinforcement of the already existing 24-hour police deployment in the area.
