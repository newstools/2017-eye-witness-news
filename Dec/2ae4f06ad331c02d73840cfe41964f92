                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Johannesburg says it has tabled a successful motion in the Johannesburg metro council for the provision of safe and affordable accommodation for previously disadvantaged students. It says more than 50,000 registered students who applied for student accommodation at accredited institutions of higher learning in Johannesburg couldn't be housed in the 2017 academic year. The party is calling on the metro to take at least 10% of the identified bad buildings in the city and convert them into safe, affordable and well-furnished student accommodation. EFF's Musa Novela says the City of Johannesburg  should immediately establish a process to form a partnership with all the institutions of higher learning that are within the city's jurisdiction. “The city can be able to make such important intervention in making the learning environment as conducive as possible because without proper accommodation students won’t be able to study properly and pass.” Novela says some students end up living in environments detrimental to their studies due to the lack of accommodation. “We have a lot of students whom have been reported sleeping in libraries, sleeping in toilets and all those other places. So we feel like the city has a responsibility to try and make the environment for students as conducive as possible.”
