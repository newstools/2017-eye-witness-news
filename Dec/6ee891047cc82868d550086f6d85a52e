                                         JOHANNESBURG - Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says the Western Cape drought has shown little improvement after not receiving the expected winter rains. Mokonyane was speaking on the sidelines of the Water Infrastructure Investment Summit on Tuesday at in Sandton. The various water boards and the department have invited big business to share investment opportunities in water infrastructure. Mokonyane says the Western Cape is the last province still majorly hit by the drought. “It is where KZN was two years ago at this time and where other provinces were in 2016 during this time. Unfortunately, we were relying on the winter rains which did not come.” Mokonyane says the department has opted to look at alternatives ways of providing water. “We’re investing in the acquisition of groundwater through the refurbishment of boreholes as well as the purification. The second option is to explore the desalination solutions that can yield more water for the City of Cape Town.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
