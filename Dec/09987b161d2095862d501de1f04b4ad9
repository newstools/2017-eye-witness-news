                                         JOHANNESBURG- Cape Town City ended Mamelodi Sundowns’ winning streak when they beat the log leaders 1-0 at Loftus Versfeld on Tuesday night.  The win ensures that City finish the year in second position, while Sundowns will be disappointed with the defeat but will be buoyed by the fact that they will go into the new year at the summit of the Absa Premiership log.  Ghanaian youngster Nana Akosah-Bempa scored the only goal of the match, in a game that was electric from start to finish. The Brazilians' attacking force were menacing the whole night, but City’s defense and goalkeeper Sage Stephans ensured that they kept a clean sheet on the night. Talisman Aubrey Ngoma, who has struggled with injury in recent times, beat the Sundowns off-side trap after a slick counter-attacking move, and calmly played a square ball to find Akosah-Bempa in the box whose side foot effort went past a diving Dennis Onyango to find the back of the net.  City’s victory is the third consecutive victory over Sundowns, which is an impressive feat considering that Sundowns have only lost ten league games since October 2015.
