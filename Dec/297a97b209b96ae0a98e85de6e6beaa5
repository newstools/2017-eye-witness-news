                                         JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Mathews Phosa says that he has given secretary-general Gwede Mantashe until the end of Thursday to declare the Mpumalanga provincial general council  unlawful. He says he will approach the court if Mantashe fails to do so.  Phosa claims that provincial chairperson David Mabuza has a militia made up of MKMVA members to disrupt branch meetings and intimidate members who wanted to vote for either himself or deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. The party in the province has, however, denied the claims saying that they’re unfounded and a desperate attempt to rescue his presidential campaign. Despite the Mpumalanga ANC labelling Phosa’s statements a fabrication, the presidential hopeful has given Mabuza and Mantashe an ultimatum. “Unless they ask for the unity vote to be declared illegal, we’ll ask the courts to declare it.”  He says this issue and others bubbling up in KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State are clear threats to the ANC national conference meant to start in just over a week. “I don’t want to go to the extreme and say the conference should be stopped, but you should worry about this.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
