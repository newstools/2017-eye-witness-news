                                         MPUMALANGA - African National Congress (ANC) Mpumalanga chairperson David Mabuza  says individuals elected at this month’s 54th elective conference must put the interests of those they lead first. He says his province remains united in fighting for unity. He’s addressed hundreds of delegates at the Mbombela Stadium who’ve convened to consolidate branch nominations. Mabuza has a message to those contesting leadership roles in the ANC. He says liberation movements in Africa have died because they lost touch with those they led. He’s called for a united front. Mabuza says members should respect the outcome of the conference and rally behind those elected to power.
