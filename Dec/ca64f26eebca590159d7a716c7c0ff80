                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Townâ€™s water crisis has worsened with dam levels dropping and consumption increasing this week. The average dam level has dropped by 1.1% to 33%, while water use rose to 641 million litres per day. That means only 34% of residents are meeting the target of 87 litres or less per day. The City of Cape Town says at this rate the water system will fail on 29 April.
