                                         CAPE TOWN - Amid regular reports of a growing brain drain at the South African Revenue Service (Sars), the tax-collecting agency has now confirmed that over 500 people left its employ in the first 10 months of the year. More than two-thirds are as a result of voluntary resignation. In response to a Parliamentary question from the Democratic Alliance, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, says at least a fifth left for other career opportunities. The revelation comes in the wake of a R50 billion revenue shortfall this year and controversy around Sars commissioner Tom Moyane. Sars says the Protection of Personal Information Act makes it unable to disclose the names of those who have left the service. At least 85 of those who left over the last 10 months have said they were leaving for personal reasons, while another 81 have chosen not to provide a reason for resigning. More than a fifth of the 506 employees who have left worked in customer service. But the revenue service has also lost at least 58 auditors, with an average of 17 years of experience, and 27 legal staff with more than 10 years of experience. Sars says it fired at least 40 people due to misconduct or incapacity, while 83 retired. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
