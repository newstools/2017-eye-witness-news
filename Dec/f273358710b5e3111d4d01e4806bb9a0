Tropical storm Tembin has lashed the country's second-largest island of Mindanao since Friday, triggering floods and mudslides. Emergency rescue officials are digging through the mud and debris in search of more possible bodies The Philippines is often hit by as many as 20 major storms in a year but rarely affecting Mindanao. Soldiers and police joined emergency workers and volunteers to search for survivors and victims, clear debris and restore power and communications. Disaster officials said many villagers had ignored warnings to leave coastal areas and move away from riverbanks, and got swept away when flash floods and landslides struck. The storm was moving west on Sunday, over some outlying Philippine islands and the South China Sea towards southern Vietnam, at a speed of about 20 kph (12 mph). It intensified into a typhoon with winds of 120 kph (75 mph) as it moved out of the Philippine area of responsibility, the national meteorological agency said.
