                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (Sars) says the decline in personal income tax contributions could be attributed to consumer reluctance and a slip in tax compliance. The revenue service says tax revenue collection has almost doubled in the last decade. However, personal income tax, which is the largest contributor to revenue, dropped in the last year. Sars' Randal Carolissen said: “It is a slowdown from the previous growth levels. In the past it used to grow by over 12% and that speaks directly to the moderation of bonuses that were paid out in the financial sector. It also speaks to the reluctance of companies to hire and a lot of managers have lost their jobs.”
