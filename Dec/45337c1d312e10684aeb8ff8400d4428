                                         JOHANNESBURG - With only 9 days to go before the African National Congress (ANC)’s elective conference, the race for the party’s leadership has entered a crucial stage where the jostling, lobbying and even the possible buying of delegates heading to the conference has intensified. Eyewitness News takes a look at what will potentially play out over the next few days, now that the provincial parties have consolidated nominations from branches and made their preferred candidates official. The race is now tight between Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa, who will battle it out to be President Jacob Zuma’s replacement come the 16th of this month. Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa may be in the lead as far as provincial nominations are concerned, but the real numbers are those of voting delegates coming to the conference. Presidential hopefuls will be hoping that the number of delegates coming from branches that nominated them is large enough to secure them victory. But this crucial stage of the race opens the door to some dirty activities, such as the manipulation of who ends up at the conference, as political analyst Lukhona Mnguni explains. "If you are not supporting what the province is supporting, will the province sabotage your ability to be in Nasrec?" ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa agrees that this period will be heated and may lead to money exchanging hands. "If there is somebody who runs around with bags of money, take money but keep the money off the branch." It will all be about loyalty and honesty at the conference as branch delegates who will vote for leadership won’t have to prove to their branches that they cast their ballots as mandated.
