                                         MPUMALANGA - The African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga is set to hold its provincial general council on Friday where it’s expected to consolidate branch nominations for the party’s leadership race later this month. Several other provinces including the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Free State have already completed their PGCs, with the Cape nominating Cyril Ramaphosa for ANC president, while the Free State opted for Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma during a hastily organised council on Tuesday. Mpumalanga, the ANC’s second largest province, will send over 700 voting delegates to the party’s elective conference in the next 16 days. During a special provincial general council in Mpumalanga in September, chairperson David Mabuza said that the ANC is bigger than an individual, that it has trained leaders, and that the PGC will work towards the unity of the ANC by allowing delegates to vote freely and without fear.
