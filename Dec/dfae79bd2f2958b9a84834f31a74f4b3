                                         PRETORIA - The High Court has ruled that the Public Protector’s remedial action that the chief justice appoint a judge to preside over a state capture Commission of Inquiry is appropriate because President Jacob Zuma is personally implicated in corruption. The full bench in Pretoria rejected all of Zuma’s grounds for reviewing the State of Capture remedial action. The president has been given 30 days to appoint a Commission of Inquiry as instructed by the Public Protector. Judge President Dunstan Mlambo says President Zuma has a clear interest in the outcome of the state capture Commission of Inquiry. “The president is implicated in the state capture report and is at the centre of the allegations regarding the Gupta family’s involvement in the appointment of Cabinet ministers.” He says the Public Protector’s remedial action took into account the context. “The Public Protector’s direction that the chief justice selects the judge who is to preside over the Commission of Inquiry is both necessary and appropriate in order to render the remedial action taken, suitable and effective. The president’s contrary arguments must be rejected.” Zuma has been ordered to fully support the judge appointed by the chief justice to preside over the inquiry.
