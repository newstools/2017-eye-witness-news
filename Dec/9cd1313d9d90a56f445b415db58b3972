                                         LONDON - The African National Congress (ANC) election has been making world news for several days now. With the outcome receiving a lot of attention in Britain. It began with a cover story in The Economist last week, which urged the ANC to ditch the Zumas and avoid what it called a dire two-decade dynasty of dysfunction. In a runup to election night, the BBC and others offered explainers of what’s at stake. When the announcement was made, both the BBC and Sky News took it live. There hasn’t been any formal reaction from the government yet, but this may well come later on Tuesday. The outcome, however, is in all the newspapers and all major websites, with headlines like, “Can Ramaphosa give South Africans new hope?” WATCH: The new ANC top 6 announced  Meanwhile, Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga has congratulated new ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa, saying that he is confident he will give new energy to Africa’s economic dynamism. In a statement released shortly after Ramaphosa had been declared ANC president, Odinga said it will thrill democrats in South Africa, across Africa and throughout the world. The 72-year-old former Kenyan Prime Minister said it’s from this pivotal ANC position and drawing on South Africa’s still vibrant global standing that Ramaphosa would restore the high respect the country, as well as the continent, enjoyed under the fabled leadership of Nelson Mandela.
