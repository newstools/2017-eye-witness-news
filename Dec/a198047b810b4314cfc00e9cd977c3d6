                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament has confirmed that a complaint against African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Mervyn Dirks i s receiving the highest attention. Dirks is accused of insulting fellow MP Priscilla Mantashe during a fiery session in the National Assembly on Thursday. After denying he'd done anything wrong and then showing the Democratic Alliance the middle finger, he was eventually asked to leave the House. Luthuli House has also been asked to look into the matter. Parliament's spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says Speaker Baleka Mbete is attending to the complaint against Dirks. “The Speaker will determine what should be the appropriate cause of action, which includes which suitable committee should the matter be referred to in order for an investigation to take place.” He says the incident flies in the face of the 16 days of activism aimed at challenging behaviours and norms that allow violence against women. Dirks's conduct has been an issue in the past; he has previously been accused of using a racial slur to refer to DA MP Phumzile Van Damme.
