                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Chamber of Mines has welcomed the 5.2% tariff hike granted to Eskom. The scandal-plagued parastatal had asked Nersa approve a tariff hike of just under 20%, arguing it needed to shore up its balance sheet. The chamber says while the latest hike is welcomed, it's concerned that electricity costs continue to be the fastest growing component of the mining sector's cost base. Chamber of Mines chief economist Henk Langenhoven said in a statement: “While we welcome Nersa’s decision to limit the increase to an estimated allowable revenue of about R190 billion rather than the R220 billion requested by Eskom, electricity costs continue to be the fastest growing component of the mining sector’s cost base having increased by more than 300% over the past eight years."
