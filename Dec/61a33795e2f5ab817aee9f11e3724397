                                         CAPE TOWN - Just days after being named Traffic Officer of The Year, Kevin Baker has assisted an Eerste River couple who was in labour in peak hour traffic. Officer Baker was on duty on the corner of the R300 highway and Van Riebeeck Road on Monday night when a man came running towards him, fearing that his wife was going to give birth in their car. The officer moved the pregnant woman into his patrol vehicle and rushed her to Karl Bremer Hospital. The city’s Maxine Bezuidenhout said: “Officer Baker moved the woman to his patrol vehicle and rushed her to a hospital with blue lights and siren. Baker got the mother to be in the hospital in time and the father arrived in time to witness the birth of a healthy baby boy.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
