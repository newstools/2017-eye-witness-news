                                         JOHANNESBURG - There have been calls for the Basic Education Department to intensify efforts to improve literacy and numeracy in the classroom, especially in the foundation phase. An international study measuring literacy levels found that the majority of grade four pupils at South Africa’s schools are illiterate. The ANC’s commission on education, health and technology on Wednesday reported back on its resolutions. Minister Naledi Pandor says South Africa’s literacy and numeracy rates needs urgent attention. “With recognition of some of the gains made over the past few years, we need to see much stronger levels of achievement within the basic education system.” LISTEN: Here's what may be a solution to SA's literacy problem  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
