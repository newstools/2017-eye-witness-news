                                         CAPE TOWN - New National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole says all members of the police service should be vetted.  But the system cannot keep pace with processing more than 100,000 members. Parliament’s Police Portfolio committee was, however, outraged to learn that the brigadier who allegedly faked a security clearance certificate for the former acting head of crime intelligence is still in her job.  Sithole says that in future, no police officer will be appointed or promoted unless they’ve been vetted. He also plans to initiate lifestyle audits for the South African Police Service (SAPS)'s top brass. But police are still investigating the fabrication of security clearance for former acting head of crime intelligence Pat Mokushane. “She’s still employed and working. I need to be very honest about it.” MPs say it’s unacceptable that since August, no disciplinary action has been taken against Brigadier Leonora Bamuza-Phetlhe. Sitole says the new acting ahead of crime intelligence, King Bhoyi Ngcobo, will be taking charge of the investigation. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
