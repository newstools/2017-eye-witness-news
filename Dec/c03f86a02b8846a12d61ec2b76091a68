                                         DURBAN - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says it is worried about a developing narrative that it is hell-bent on rigging the numbers in order for a particular candidate to win. This comes after KZN was the only province to question discrepancies with the nomination figures announced on Monday evening at its general council. After deliberation with the ANC’s election’s agency and officials from the IEC nominees like Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, David Mabuza and Jessie Duarte had their branch nomination figures increased. In a crucial announcement on Tuesday, Dlamini Zuma received an additional 21 branch nominations because of discrepancies in certain regions. Cyril Ramaphosa was one of the candidates who had his number reduced from 193 nominations to 191. So what then happened to the two branches that had supposedly voted for CR17? Was there an incorrect recording of names? KZN ANC spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli says the Abaqulusi region’s branches were counted more than once. “It was a deduction because of the miscalculation, so two branches were to be removed because they were counted twice.” Ntuli says the KZN PEC has raised concerns that people believe it is trying to rig the numbers and maintains the integrity of the conference should be important to all ANC members.
