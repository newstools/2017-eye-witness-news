                                         JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress (ANC) lawmakers have been ordered to move quickly on the question of a media appeals tribunal. The proposal has been on the governing party’s agenda for several years and has been fiercely opposed by the media fraternity as an attack on press freedom.  The South African media has a self-regulatory system. WATCH: Sanef: Zuma attack on media unacceptable  ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says MPs have been told by delegates at the party's national conference to set up an inquiry to explore a new mechanism to regulate the media. Mthembu also chairs the party’s communications sub-committee where the idea of a media appeals tribunal was discussed. He told journalists on Wednesday that delegates expect him to drive the proposed parliamentary inquiry. “The best forum to look at this matter is Parliament. They said, ‘Chief whip you should have made this inquiry happen.’ So I came for a caning as well on this matter.” The ANC has also set a new deadline for digital migration which was supposed to have taken place more than two years ago, along with other countries. If all goes according to plan, the move from analogue to digital television should happen by 2019. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
