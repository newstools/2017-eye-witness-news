                                         JOHANNESBURG - The treasurer at the Bank of Athens is set to apply for bail at the Palm Ridge magistrates court on Friday morning in connection with the murder of his wife.  Enzo Pietropaolo allegedly shot his wife 11 times at her Brackenhurst home in Alberton last month.  It’s understood that Manuela Pietropaolo was in the process of divorcing her husband at the time of her murder. The police's Andre de Jager says that the investigating officer has now obtained four statements from family members which will be used in court to oppose bail. This week, police confirmed that more than 200 bullets were seized from Pietropaolo’s office at the Bank of Athens in Sandton.  Security guards, who were first on the scene, claim that he had packed his clothes and was ready to flee presumably to his home country Italy. It’s also believed that Pietropaolo may have used gloves to clean his firearms with chemicals after the crime.
