                                         JOHANNESBURG- Mamelodi Sundowns carried on with their impressive winning form, when they dispatched Bloemfontein Celtic 4-1 on Saturday to extend their lead at the top of the standings to six points.  Sundowns recorded their sixth win in seven games, and they look like firm favorites to win the Absa Premier League title, but the volatile nature of the league means that Sundowns will have to continue with their current form if they are to claim the title from defending champions Bidvest Wits. The Brazilians dominated proceedings in the early stages of the match at Loftus, but they nearly found themselves on the back foot when Celtic’s Victor Letsoalo left foot shot cannoned off the crossbar.  Sundowns then found their feet again and regained the ascendancy two minutes into the second stanza when Thokozani Sekotlong’s magnificent diving header gave the hosts the lead. Sundowns didn’t take too long to double their advantage, as a neat one-two between Tiyani Mabunda and Oupa Manyisa resulted in Mabunda firing past Patrick Tignyemb in goal. Then it was the turn of Percy Tau and Themba Zwane who scored the third and fourth respectively for Sundowns.  Ronald Pfumbidzai scored the consolation goal for Celtic but it was all too late as Sundowns wrapped up an emphatic 4-1 win and claimed all three points.
