                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape road death toll is approaching 100 deaths since the start of the month. Earlier on Friday, a motorist was killed after he was struck by a taxi while he was changing his car's flat tyre near Rawsonville. Five others were killed when their vehicle rammed into a jackknifed truck near Beaufort West late on Thursday night. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said: “We’ve already lost 97 lives on our roads since 1 December and this is way over last year’s total already. We are pleading with motorists, urging them to come on board and we cannot go on like this.”
