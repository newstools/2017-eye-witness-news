                                         CAPE TOWN - Despite failing to win the Cape Town Sevens, the Blitzboks side were full of praise for the home support in the Mother City. The event was once again a success with over 100,000 people in attendance over the weekend. New Zealand ran out as eventual winners after beating Argentina in the final, with South Africa finishing third. Blitzboks captain Phillip Snyman says that from the opening match the home crowdâ€™s support was electric. South Africa lost in the semi-final to eventual winners New Zealand, which stunned the home crowd but Snyman says the support never waned despite the heart break. The Blitzboks finished with the competition with a victory after beating Canada in the bronze medal match. South Africa were strong favourites to win the tournament but in an effort to please the enthusiastic support of the home crowd they lacked their usual fluidity, often looking frantic during matches. Coach Neil Powell admits this could have been a factor. WATCH: Weird and wacky costumes at 2017 Cape Town Sevens
