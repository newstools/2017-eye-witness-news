                                         CAPE TOWN - State Security Agency head Arthur Fraser says plans are in the pipeline to introduce regulations to punish those in state-owned companies who refuse to be vetted. He's told Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) a new online vetting system could be introduced as early as April. Fraser and Security Minister Bongani Bongo were called to explain why so few officials at South African Airways (SAA) and Transnet in particular, have not been vetted given the dire mismanagement of the two companies. Bongo says he's still verifying a report on exactly how many staff members at SAA have refused to be vetted. “Another person at Treasury who refused is saying the former minister is the one who said he must not be vetted.” Spy boss Arthur Fraser says current legislation allows some departments to provide their own security clearance. “Heads of institutions can override. So even if the agency decides not to give clearance, the heads of institutions can still say I want [to employ that person].” Fraser and Bongo have suggested Scopa hold a closed-door meeting, so the agency can share more details about those who have refused to be vetted.
