                                         JOHANNESBURG - Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa)'s new acting CEO Cromet Molepo says one of his first priorities will be tackle vandalism of trains. Molepo says that an average of 80 coaches are targeted across the country every month either due to protests or frustration.  He says a lack of communication has also led to anger among commuters. “We’ll be introducing radios where there will be proper communication, we’ll also be introducing Metro Apps so that people on their cell phones can get information.  “We’ll also have a similar system where we communicate with employers in terms of train movements, if there are any undue delays.” Molepo is the third acting CEO at Prasa in two years. It’s being reported that he was suspended by KwaZulu-Natal Umgeni Water following allegations of financial misconduct. He has however denied it, saying that he resigned. Meanwhile, Metrorail in Cape Town has confirmed that its services are derailing. The rail company's own statistics confirm this along with the complaints from hundreds of commuters. In Metrorails recent Myline newspaper distributed at many stations, stats further confirm the ongoing problems seen on many train lines. They show in the week from 30 November to 6 December, only 14% of trains on the busy central line were on time in the mornings and only one train in three in the evenings.  On the southern line, only 40% of trains were on time in the mornings and 54% in the evenings. About 40% of trains were cancelled.
