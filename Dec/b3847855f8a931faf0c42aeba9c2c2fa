                                         CAPE TOWN - Judgment in the Winnie Rust murder trial will be delivered on Monday.  Nigel and Johannes Plaaitjies stand accused of robbing and killing the author at her Wellington home last year. Rust financially supported 19-year-old Nigel Plaaitjies and took on the role of his mentor.  The State claims that the duo went on a shopping spree shortly after they robbed and murdered Rust in her home while her husband was asleep. The prosecution says that the men spent nearly R20,000 using Rust's bank cards and money they withdrew from her accounts. Nigel Plaaitjies has admitted to the robbery, but denies killing the 77-year-old, who he says was like a second mother. His uncle Johannes Plaaitjies denies any involvement and claims he was not in Wellington at the time of the attack.Both accused have opted not to testify in their own defence.
