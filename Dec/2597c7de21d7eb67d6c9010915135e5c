                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma insists everything possible is being done to ensure next week's African National Congress (ANC) elective conference is successful, peaceful and orderly, adding that he is happy to be stepping down as president. Zuma addressed the energy indaba underway in Midrand. President Zuma says people don’t know how happy he is to be stepping down as ANC president. “If you come to realise that in one week and a few days that Zuma will be president, he will no longer be and he’s very happy.” He says the party’s elective conference next week is the biggest story and he agrees it will have an impact on the economy. “A united and strong ANC is good for business and the country, that is our conviction.” Zuma says in his recent meeting with presidential hopefuls, dubbed “the last supper”, everyone agreed on the need to ensure unity, order and cohesion at the conference. President Zuma says as he steps down next week, he is promising to work with whoever emerges victorious at the party's elective conference to ensure a seamless handover. He has acknowledged there’s anxiety in the business community about what will transpire at the ANC’s conference next week and the impact the outcome of that gathering will have on the country’s future. In an attempt to allay fears, he’s given this assurance. “Let me assure you that everything possible is being done to ensure a successful conference and transition to the future.” Despite having endorsed Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma over her rival Cyril Ramaphosa, the president says he will work with whoever wins next week. “To ensure a successful and seamless handover to the new leadership.”
