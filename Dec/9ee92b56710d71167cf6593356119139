Nasrec was already a well-secured venue, but Monday saw increased numbers of South African Police Services and Johannesburg Metro Police deployed. PRETORIA - Intelligence sources have confirmed to Eyewitness News that the heightened police presence at the African National Congress (ANC) national conference  on Monday is to quell possible disruptions by a losing faction. The announcement of who will be the new president of the ANC as well as the other top leaders is imminent. The top positions are being hotly contested by Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa. Nasrec was already a well-secured venue but Monday saw increased numbers of South African Police Services and Johannesburg Metro Police deployed. Gauteng police confirmed this morning that police had been placed on high alert pending the release of the election results. But Eyewitness News’ crime intelligence sources say there is a strong likelihood that a losing faction will attempt to disrupt proceedings, in order to force a review of the election process. In October, the police were forced to intervene in the Eastern Cape provincial conference when rival factions attacked each other with chairs and bottles, leaving several people injured. The police’s spokesperson Vish Naidoo says he has not received any report to suggest police are expecting any form of unrest at the national conference.
