                                         JOHANNESBURG - The so-called "missing 68" voters are considering an offer from the African National Congress (ANC)'s leadership to meet with them at Luthuli House on Thursday or Friday and avoid going to court.  Lawyers for the ANC have responded to a letter of demand from the 68.  They demanded that their votes be considered in the count for the top office bearers of the ANC after there was a dispute over counting.  The attorney representing the 68 says that his clients are considering the request and that he's responded asking for more details about the meeting.  They've drawn up legal papers and are prepared to go to court over the matter but had said they will wait for the plenary at the conference at Nasrec to discuss the issue first. Lawyer Dexter Selepe says that there's no court action at present. "We're still exploring the internal remedies that are available to ANC members and it would be premature to talk about going to court. But we are ready in any event. We are letting processes take their course."
