                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Water and Sanitation Department says recent rainfalls in Gauteng have resulted in the integrated Vaal River system increasing its levels to 71.2%, from 69.9% just last week. The department says the system, which consists of 14 dams that are vital for the province, had been decreasing week-on-week before the downpours. The department's Sputnik Ratau said: “Well, we are quite pleased with the fact that we have seen a slight increase with regards to the integrated Vaal River system. This has been very, very helpful for us because we know that last year this time we were dealing with matters that were not really in our hands but that were very difficult.” However, Ratau says the Western Cape is still worrisome, with dam levels there being extremely low. “Unfortunately, the Western Cape is a winter rainfall season area and unless they pray very hard, I doubt there’ll be any rain soon.” Meanwhile, Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane  will on Wednesday morning give an update on how far defaulting municipalities are on making payment arrangements to settle their outstanding debts. Last month, Mokonyane revealed that R10 billion is owed to her department by defaulting municipalities. She said the department had explored all options to recover the monies to pay outstanding water bills but more than 180 municipalities remain in arrears. The department says it will target 30 municipalities owing individual debt of R50 million older than six months.
