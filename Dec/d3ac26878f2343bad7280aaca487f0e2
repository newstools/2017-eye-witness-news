                                         CAPE TOWN - Consumers are being urged not to overspend during the festive season.  Economist Dawie Roodt  says people often hear a voice telling them to spend and to buy goods. “You go into the holiday season and you start spending money. And there’s this little monkey on your shoulder that keeps on pulling your ear and whispers that you don’t have the money…that really spoils the whole holiday.” Roodt adds people should buy what they want only if they have planned ahead.  January is a month many dread. Roodt says with the necessary planning consumers can survive the Christmas blues. “So if you really want to spend money this holiday season, go ahead and spend the money, provided that you’ve planned for this."
