                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it has filed criminal charges against the reinstated acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko following what it calls the sham of a disciplinary hearing. Koko was found not guilty of all charges relating to misconduct during disciplinary procedures which led to his reinstatement. He came under fire earlier this year because he allegedly awarded lucrative Eskom contracts, worth R1 billion, to a company linked to his stepdaughter. The opposition party says it believes Koko may have used his position at Eskom to improperly benefit his step-daughter and her company. The DA’s Natasha Mazzone said: “Since Eskom and minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown are incapable of holding the seemingly captured and heavily implicated culprits to account, it will now be up to the SAPS and the Hawks to investigate the matter and take action should they find evidence of wrongdoing.”
