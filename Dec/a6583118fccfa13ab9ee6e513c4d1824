                                         PRETORIA - The Cape Law Society says its deeply worried by recent baseless attacks on the judiciary. Last week, the court set aside the appointment of Shaun Abrahams  as head of the National Prosecuting Authority and barred President Jacob Zuma f rom playing any role in the appointment of a new national director. African National Congress Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini  was quoted over the weekend saying she believed the judges were told what to write in their ruling. The Cape Law Society says it regrets Dlamini’s statements, which suggest that the court was lobbied by one or other group in society. It says no serious observer will believe that Dlamini has evidence to support her claims. The society says attacks on the judiciary undermine the standing of the courts in the minds of the people. It has called on leaders of public organisations to desist from bringing the judiciary and the judicial system into disrepute. Meanwhile, President Zuma has filed his application for leave to appeal against Friday’s ruling. The president has been given 30 days to set up inquiry into state capture and must personally pay the costs of his failed attempt to block the release of the State of Capture report.
