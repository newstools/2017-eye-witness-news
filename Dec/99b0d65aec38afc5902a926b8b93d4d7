                                         CAPE TOWN - Rebuilding efforts following the massive Knysna wildfires will include getting rid of alien vegetation to prevent another disaster. Seven people died and at least 1,000 homes were destroyed when fires blazed through Knysna and Plettenberg Bay in June. Garden Route Rebuild co-ordinator Hildegard Fast says there has been a steady rebuilding of homes in the areas. Fast says alien invasive species need to be removed or controlled, as they burn more quickly and generate more heat than indigenous plants. “We’ve been able to raise funds from two municipalities - Eden and Knysna, which has enabled us to start doing some alien eradication work. And we’ve also managed to raise some private money to do so. So, in the next two months, there’s going to be a programme to spray herbicides and all of the alien seedlings that are now coming up.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
