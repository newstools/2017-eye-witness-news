The council suspended its president Danisa Baloyi after she was implicated in the disappearance of a R5 million donation by Acsa. JOHANNESBURG - Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) says it entered into its arrangement with the Black Business Council  in good faith but was misled about the receipt of its donation. The council suspended its president Danisa Baloyi after she was implicated in the disappearance of a R5 million donation by Acsa. The council says its investigation is at an advanced stage. Acsa’s Bongani Maseko says they assumed the donation reached the council’s account until they received a second request for a donation from the council. “It was when they realised that the documentation sent to us with regards to where the payment should be made, was not their account and that's when they said they would like to initiate their own investigation.” He says on their part they followed all due process in making the donation. Meanwhile, the council says it's investigating how the payment was made into the account of a company called Merit Energy and not the council’s account. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
