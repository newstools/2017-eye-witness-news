                                         CAPE TOWN – Eleven-year-old Stacha Arendse’s killer has asked her parents for forgiveness. Randy Tango has been convicted on two counts of rape and murder on Thursday. The young girl had been killed and dumped on a soccer field in Tafelsig in March this year. Defence attorney Koos Smit has told the court his client wishes he could say sorry to the girl he killed. Smit says Tango has pleaded for forgiveness from Arendse’s parents. The lawyer has asked the court to consider not handing down a life sentence. But prosecutor Marèse Engelbrecht says her Cape Town office has dealt with 56 child murder cases this year and that a harsh sentence is needed to deter others. Engelbrecht has also read out a letter from Arendse’s mother Sandy Markgraff in which she writes: “The sudden death of our daughter left an emptiness that would never be filled again.”  Sentencing takes place on 11 December.
