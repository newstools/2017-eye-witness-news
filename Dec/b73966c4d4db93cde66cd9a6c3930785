                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) reasons warrant neither her suspension nor her removal. In a statement, De Lille has reaffirmed her plans to turn to the courts should the party boot her from her position. A party sub-committee probe has found management and government-related problems in the City of Cape Town. In October, DA leader Mmusi Maimane had placed both De Lille and Councillor JP Smith on special leave from party activities. It followed allegations of maladministration within the city. De Lille had accused Smith of making malicious and defamatory remarks after her decision to shut down the city’s Special Investigations Unit in August. She says she and her team have worked extremely hard to elevate the administration to its current position of being the best run in the country. De Lille has requested an extension of the period for her to provide reasons why she should not resign. DA officials say that she’s now been given until Tuesday to do so.
