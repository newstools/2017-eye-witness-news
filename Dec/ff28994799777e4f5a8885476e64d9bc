                                         JOHANNESBURG- The Warriors scraped into the T20 Challenge semi-finals when they beat the Cobras by 18 runs in East London on Sunday.  The Warriors batted first at Buffalo Park and amassed a competitive 169 with two of their experienced players, Jon-Jon Smuts (48) and Colin Ingram (41) shared an 80 run partnership.  Left-arm spinner George Linde was the pick of the Cobras bowlers, returning figures of 2/29 in his allotted four overs.  In reply, the men from the Cape got off to a fast start with openers Richard Levi and Hashim Amla, showing scant respect for the Warriors Bowlers. The pair put on a quickfire opening stand of 55 in 6 overs.  The Warriors frontline bowlers couldn’t provide the necessary penetration, prompting Captain Smuts to turn to the part-time spin duo of Colin Ingram and Colin Ackerman, who not only put the brakes on the Cobras innings, but took crucial wickets.  After the departures of Amla and Levi, the middle order couldn’t provide any sort of notable contribution and the Warriors were able to restrict the visitors to 150 for the loss of six wickets.  The win is the Warriors third in a row and catapults them into the semi-finals at the expense of the Lions whose game against the Knights was abandoned due to rain. The Dolphins thrashed a weakened Titans team in Durban to secure their spot in the semi-finals.  The first semi-final will feature the Titans against the Warriors in Centurion on Wednesday 13 December, while the Dolphins will welcome the Cobras at Kingsmead in Durban the following day.
