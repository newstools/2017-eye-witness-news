                                         CAPE TOWN - As the globe marks World Aids Day, parents are being urged to educate their children on the pandemic and its causes. Speaking at government's official event in Umthata, in the Eastern Cape, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says parents and guardians should openly talk about sensitive issues. Ramaphosa is the chairperson of the South African National Aids Council (SANAC). More than 19% of adults living with HIV in South Africa are between the ages of 15-49. With a significant proportion of young people affected, Ramaphosa has called on parents to educate children about HIV/Aids. He says education plays a critical role in the wellbeing of the country. Ramaphosa has also reiterated the importance of school children abstaining from sex, but he's added young girls who fall pregnant should go back to the classroom. The deputy president says the National Aids Council is happy to announce that the business community has joined it in the fight against HIV/Aids. Meanwhile, the Treatment Action Campaign says the public health sector should do more to serve people living with HIV/Aids. According to the World Health Organisation, almost 21 million people are receiving antiretroviral treatment.
