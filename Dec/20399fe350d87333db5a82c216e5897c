                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance says its concerned with the appointment of Dudu Myeni  as special adviser to Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi. This is according to reports in the Sunday Times. The newspaper also reported that South African Airways (SAA) may be moved from National Treasury to the Transport Department. The DA says it is concerned that if the airline does move, Myeni will meddle in SAA affairs despite laws restricting her from doing so. The DA's Alf Lees said: “One of the bigger problems is that SAA is now proposing to be moved from National Treasury to Transport. What that would do, would be to put SAA back under the influence of Ms Myeni.” The country’s top banks, however, have warned that they may recall some R8 billion that SAA owes to the banks if the airline is removed from Treasury. The banks and Investec are believed to have written to SAA introducing the new loan agreement that changes to its shareholder would trigger a recall.
