                                         PRETORIA - While President Jacob Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) have indicated they will appeal Friday’s High Court judgement, the applicants in the matter may seek an enforcement order to ensure it remains in effect, even while the matter is being appealed.  The full bench in Pretoria set aside former prosecutions boss Mxolisi Nxasana’s settlement as well as the appointment of Advocate Shaun Abrahams as the current head.  The court also ruled that Zuma is prohibited from appointing the NDPP because he himself faces fraud and corruption charges and is conflicted.  The effect of the appeal by Zuma and Abrahams is that the court order is suspended until the matter is finalised which could take months.  But the court has found that Abrahams has not acted independently in cases involving the president, which raises serious concerns over his suitability to be the one deciding whether to reinstate fraud and corruption charges against him.  The court was also highly critical of the president, whom they found repeatedly abuses court processes to gain benefits from delaying proceedings.  The first step that Corruption Watch and Freedom Under Law may pursue is to apply for an enforcement order.  But even then, Abrahams will remain in office for at least 60 days, during which time the deputy president must appoint a new prosecutions boss.
