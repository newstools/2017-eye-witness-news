                                         JOHANNESBURG - A new survey has found that citizens believe government and President Jacob Zuma are to blame for the country going in the wrong direction. Ask Afrika interviewed almost 3,000 people and 77% of the group agreed the country is going in the wrong direction due to unemployment and corruption. Ask Afrika CEO Andrea Gevers says half of the respondents believe that fighting corruption will unite the country. “What are the things our respondents want the government to address as soon as possible? The first thing, more important than employment, is fighting corruption.” She says a new African National Congress president will face a tough task to meet communities’ expectations. Gevers says 90% of those interviewed say they will vote corrupt government officials out of power.
