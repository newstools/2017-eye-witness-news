                                         JOHANNESBURG - Lawmakers have been told about incidents of intimidation against staff at the Auditor-General (AG)'s office in recent months, specifically during the municipal audit. In his general report on the accounts of departments and state entities, Kimi Makwetu also mentioned that certain audit findings are being contested and that people have received threats. Parliament's Standing Committee on the Auditor-General says these reports are shocking. Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said: “From what we gathered, there are instances where the auditees are not happy with the audit finding. And of course, it’s intimidation more than anything else to force the Auditor-General to change his audit opinion.”
