                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it’s still not receiving adequate amounts of coal from Gupta-owned Tegeta and teams have been sent to the Hendrina Power Station in Mpumalanga to verify the stockpile. In an Amabhungane exclusive, it's been revealed that Tegeta threatened to cut supply because it wants Eskom to increase the amount it pays for coal. Leaked minutes of an Eskom meeting on Friday revealed that managers were warned that the power station could be forced to shut down. Alternatively, they would have to use expensive open cycle gas turbines or contend with load shedding. The power utility needs at least a 20-day stockpile at the power station but it's been reported that there was only a seven-day supply on Monday. But Eskom’s Khulu Phasiwe says loadshedding is not a risk at this stage. “What is comforting, at least, is that we entered into discussions with them and if push comes to shove, then clearly we are going to have to pursue other means, including legal actions.  “So far, we still continue to get coal but we’re not getting as much as contracted between Eskom and Tegeta.”
