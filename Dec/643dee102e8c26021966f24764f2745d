                                         JERUSALEM - The Israeli military said on Thursday that two rockets launched at Israel from the Gaza Strip fell short inside the Palestinian enclave. Sirens sounded in Israel at various locations around the northern Gaza Strip on a day of heightened tensions following demonstrations in the coastal enclave and the occupied West Bank in which Palestinians protested at US President Donald Trump’s announcement on Wednesday that he was recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital city. There was no initial claim of responsibility from any militant groups in the Gaza Strip for the launchings.
