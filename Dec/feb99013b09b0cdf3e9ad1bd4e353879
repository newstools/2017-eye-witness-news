                                         MBOMBELA - The African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga has nominated Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as its preferred candidate for the ANC presidency. Dlamini Zuma received 123 nominations while her rival Cyril Ramaphosa clinched 117. The provincial general council has voted for Mpumalanga chair David Mabuza for the position of ANC deputy president. Two-hundred-and-twenty-three delegates have abstained from voting in the ANC provincial general council which handed Dlamini Zuma a nomination in that province. Abstentions in the vote for the presidency outnumbered the votes gathered by presidential front-runners. The council argued that it wanted the electoral commission to consolidate the abstained votes after delegates had written the word "unity" on the nomination forms. Delegates say “unity” is their preferred candidate after the close contest between presidential hopefuls Dlamini Zuma and Ramaphosa. Mabuza said: “Unity is the bedrock on which the ANC was formed, that is the foundation.” Among those nominated was General Secretary Gwede Mantashe as national chairperson and embattled KwaZulu-Natal secretary Senzo Mchunu as secretary general. Jessie Duarte is nominated to keep her position as deputy secretary and Paul Mashatile for the position of treasurer general.
