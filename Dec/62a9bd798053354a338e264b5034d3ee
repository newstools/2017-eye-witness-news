                                         JOHANNESBURG - The SABC says it has on Monday reached a wage agreement with the Communications Workers’ Union for the 2017 and 2018 financial year. Last week workers downed tools over salary disputes, demanding 10% salary adjustments while the employer was offering on 4.5%. The public broadcaster says CWU has agreed to a 4.8% increase, back-dated to July 2017. It says this has brought to an end the workers strike after Broadcasting, Electronic, Media & Allied Workers Union also signed the agreement last week following the CCMA intervention. The SABC's Kaizer Kganyago said: “Saturday we indicated that we had signed with Bemawu and today we have finalised the matter with CWU, who is our second union, and we are happy that now the matter has been resolved and the strike has been called off.”
