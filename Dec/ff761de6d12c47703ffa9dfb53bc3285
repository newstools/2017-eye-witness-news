                                         JOHANNESBURG - Australia’s fast bowler Josh Hazelwood says he is hoping for a fast bowler friendly pitch ahead of the third Ashes Test match against England at the Western Australia Cricket Association ground starting on Thursday morning. The Australians currently lead the five-match Test series 2-0, following convincing 10 wicket and 120 run victories at the Gabba in Brisbane and Adelaide Oval respectively.  The lanky New South Wales paceman has grabbed 8 wickets so far in the series, and says the WACA pitch hasn’t been favourable for bowling, but hopes that it will have something on offer in the third Test.  “It’s been pretty flat to be honest, especially the New Zealand game last summer where there were big scores, but hopefully it’ll have a bit of pace in it.” Hazelwood also says he's looking to improve with every game that he plays for Australia.  “I think I’m getting better as the series goes on, my lengths improved a lot in the last Test match and that’s what I need to keep working on.” The WACA will be hosting its 44th and final Test match, as future games are set to be hosted a new 60,000 capacity Perth Stadium from 2018.
