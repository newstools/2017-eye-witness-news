                                         BLOEMFONTEIN – The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State says its elective conference will still go ahead, despite a four-hour delay so far. The party was meant to hold the gathering last month but the Bloemfontein High Court ordered that it can’t go ahead until branches in four regions rerun their general meetings constitutionally. This elective conference was scheduled to start at 10am but hours later there is still no sign of the over 600 delegates.  Free State ANC Secretery William Bulwana explains why this is the case. “The delegates are at a registration point, they are busy registering. In terms of the arrangement, they will move to come this side where the conference will take place.” He also says it’s still unclear who Secretary General Gwede Mantashe will be sending to represent the top officials here. “He even promised to send the president or the deputy president. This morning he called to tell me that he hasn’t found both of them, but he promised to send an official.” He says the party will know after registration which branches decided to boycott this gathering.
