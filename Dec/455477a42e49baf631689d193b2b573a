The provincial party will elect the new leadership after its mandate expired in May. The conference which was scheduled to start at 10am has yet to convene. The party says the delays are due to the registration of delegates which has been underway for hours now. Free state ANC Secretery William Bulwana says: “We have measures that everything is in place. We are not worried about any violence.”
