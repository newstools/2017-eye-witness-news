                                         JOHANNESBURG - FNB says all its system are now fully operational following a glitch with its banking application earlier on Saturday. Some frustrated customers took their complaints to social media. On Friday, FNB-users were unable to withdraw cash and use other services due to a technical problem. Spokesperson Peter Alkema said: “We did have a minor glitch on our app. We picked up less than ten mentions on social media and the reason for that was some fuse building up on some of our chat messaging features. It’s all been resolved.
