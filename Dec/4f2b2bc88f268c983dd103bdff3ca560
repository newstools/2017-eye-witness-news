                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy Police Minister Bongani Mkongi says current systems are not sufficient to tackle commercial crime in South Africa. Mkongi was in Khayelitsha on Tuesday to introduce the head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation to the community. Retired judge Frans Kgomo was appointed to the position in October after it was left vacant following the passing of Judge Essa Moosa earlier in 2017. Community members and leaders, NGOs and police officers from across Cape Town were at the Luhlaza Secondary School where new Hawks head Kgomo was introduced.  The retired judge says he is aware of the importance of his role as overseer. “Fundamentally, it also protects the members of the public.” Mkongi says Kgomo’s role, as well as other policing systems, will need to be strengthened to better deal with commercial crime. “Commercial crimes are committed by sophisticated individuals who have a lot of resources in order to sidestep the processes of the state. So, what is very important is to strengthen the Hawks and IT systems of the SA Police Service.” Kgomo has visited other provinces as well. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
