                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department has denied claims that it’s imposed a principal on a school in Soweto, saying the appointment was made according to the procedure. Parents at the Noordgesig Primary School have accused the department of appointing a new headmaster without their consent. The principal was supposed to start his first day on Friday, two years after his predecessor was sacked amid a circumcision scandal. However, parents at the school have rejected him. Parents at the school say they feel disrespected by the appointment of a new principal, as the acting headmistress was doing a good job and there was no reason to remove her. In a statement, they refer to the new headmaster as “a Bantu African” but insist they are not rejecting him on the basis of race. The department’s Steve Mabona says all necessary channels were followed. “The responsibility of appointing a principal rest with the SGB. The SGB went through the process of shortlisting and had the to interview the shortlisted candidates.”
