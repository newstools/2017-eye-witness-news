                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says its rules do not allow it to suspend Patricia de Lille from her position as mayor at this time. De Lille has until Monday to provide reasons why she should retain her job as the party's longest serving mayor. The DA announced her continued suspension from party activities on Thursday night while its federal executive considers an internal report on allegations of maladministration against her. Tensions within the DA's city caucus spilled over into the public domain recently over De Lille's decision to close down a special investigating unit. Mayco member JP Smith reported the matter to the DA. He's also currently suspended from party activity.  But the DA is playing its cards close to its chest on exactly what the investigation has revealed. National spokesperson Phumzile van Damme says: “I am unfortunately not at liberty to discuss the report until the mayor has been given the opportunity to respond. She’s been given until Monday to do so. In the interest of fairness, we want to give her the opportunity to respond.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
