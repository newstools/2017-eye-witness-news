                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says a second senior military general has been arrested and charged with fraud and corruption. The department says the first general was arrested three weeks ago, while the other was handcuffed on Wednesday. The SANDF's Simphiwe Dlamini says the top officials had allegedly been selling off defence force assets. “Selling of the defence’s assets and buying rations and other stuff for the defence force in an improper way. Selling and purchasing of goods for the SANDF by certain individuals in the defence force and using that as a money-making scheme.”
