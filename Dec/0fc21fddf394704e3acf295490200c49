                                         CAPE TOWN - A man is expected to appear in the Oudtshoorn magistrates court on Wednesday in connection with the murder of a soldier.  Preston Titus, aged 47, was found dead by his wife and daughter at their home more than a week ago. Titus’ daughter alerted her mother, when she couldn’t get into the family home after a night out. They found him in the early hours of Saturday morning inside the bedroom with multiple stab wounds to his back, arm and under his chin.  Titus’ wife, Magdalene, was taken in for questioning last week but has since been released.  The accused is expected to apply for bail on Wednesday.  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
