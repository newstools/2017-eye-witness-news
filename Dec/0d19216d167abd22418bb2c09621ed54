                                         CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has appointed law firm Bowman Gilfillan to conduct an investigation into allegations of tender irregularities in its Transport and Urban Development Authority. The probe will have to be completed by the end of December.  On Tuesday, the council decided behind closed doors not to suspend any of those linked to the alleged cover-ups or those who attempted to expose and investigate the matter. Council refrained from discussing in public why it had decided not to suspend transport commissioner Melissa Whitehead or city manager Achmat Ebrahim. Executive director in the mayor's office Craig Kesson, who blew the lid on the alleged tender corruption, will also remain in his job.  Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says: “I don’t want to enter into the merits or demerits of the allegations contained in Kesson’s report. That will be tested.” The city's head of probity Lindiwe Ndaba, who was suspended earlier this month after attempts to investigate Kesson’s claims, will be asked to return to work until the investigation has been concluded.
