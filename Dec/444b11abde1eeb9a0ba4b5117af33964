                                         CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) says it won’t hesitate to act against those who are trying to buy votes or using other fraudulent means to influence delegates who will choose new party leaders at the weekend. Senior ANC member Jackson Mthembu in a Facebook post this week alleged desperate attempts to sway delegates in favour of Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, and a number of court challenges over processes in the run-up to the party’s national conference. With just days to go before the ANC elects a new president and leadership, lobbying is approaching fever pitch amid claims of vote buying and other dodgy schemes to try and decide the outcome. The ANC’s Zizi Kodwa says they’re aware of the allegations: “We will not hesitate to take any decision here at this conference of anybody, regardless of which camp you come from, to remove you, but also to make sure that we subject you to the disciplinary action of the organisation.” Kodwa says such practices subvert the ANC’s internal democracy and undermine the right of branches to decide on new leaders. Voting will be by secret ballot, and no cellphones will be allowed in the booths. “We’ll look for the culprits who are said to be running around with bags of money, we are following them, and we’ve identified that on all sides, there are culprits. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula tweeted a picture of a bag of cash and the hashtag vote buying, but the photograph was found to be several years old.
