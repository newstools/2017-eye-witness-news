                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) General Secretary Gwede Mantashe says all branches disputing provincial general council outcomes have until Saturday to hold reruns. Mantashe says the party is just about ready to host its elective conference. “The NEC was unanimous on the need to commit itself and all the members of the organisation to work in hand and working together for unity.” He says seven of the nine provinces have concluded their general councils but there are a number of disputes by branches which still need to be cleared. “Where there were appeals and decisions taken to re-run the PGMs, those branches are given until Saturday to re-run those PGMs.  Mantashe didn’t give the number of disputes before the party but says they must be sorted by Saturday.
