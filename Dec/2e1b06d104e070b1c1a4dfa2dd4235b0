This rhino calf is the second one born in the past three weeks. CAPE TOWN - The Aquila Private Game Reserve is celebrating a new addition to its family, a baby rhino. The white rhino calf came as a surprise at around lunch-time on Sunday. The reserve’s Lynley Mitchell said: “It was an absolute surprise to everyone, as currently, the rhino cow has a two-year-old calf that’s still walking with her. So, it’s a unique story because the rhino cow will not mate with a male until her calf has left her side, which is usually up to three years old.” This rhino calf is the second one born in the past three weeks. Reserve owner Searl Derman says it’s been a remarkable few years for the rhino population at Aquila, where the endangered species is under the constant watchful eye of a sophisticated and experienced anti-poaching unit.
