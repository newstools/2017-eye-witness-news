                                         CAPE TOWN - Safety and security worries among some rail workers is at the heart of a potential strike. The United Transport & Allied Trade Union (Untu) has given the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) 48-hours to respond to its demands to drastically improve regulations around safety or face an industrial action on Monday. The move comes after Prasa suspended several Untu-aligned train drivers on Thursday morning after they refused to work on the central line. Prasa has, since then, agreed to lift the suspension and meet with the union's leaders. Untu's Steve Harris said: “You can decrease the service totally and ensure that you stay within the limits of the agreement and the rules, and you can still deliver a lesser service and you can back up the service with bus transport. But then you need to advise the commuters upfront.”
