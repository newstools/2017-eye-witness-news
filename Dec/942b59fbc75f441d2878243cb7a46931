It’s understood seven gunmen entered the store and shots were exchanged between the criminals and the owner of the store. Police say the men fled the scene and no one has been arrested. The police's Daniel Mavimbela said: “Currently, there are indications that one of those suspects is injured, wherever they are. The message from the awareness campaign that we have been doing is paying off because people seem to be vigilant and more aware [of their surroundings].”
