                                         TEL AVIV - Clashes have broken out across the West Bank  where dozens of Palestinians are reported injured. Tensions are high in the wake of American President Donald Trump’s announcement that he recognises Jerusalem  as Israel's capital.  His policy shift was hailed by Israel but condemned across the Arab and Islamic world. Western allies of the United States have also disavowed the move, which reversed decades of US neutrality on the status of Jerusalem. In the West Bank, Israeli forces are clashing with Palestinians in the cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah, Hebron and Nablus, as well as smaller locations. Clouds of tear gas and thick, black smoke from burning tyres filled up the air. In some cities, dirty water was sprayed on stone-throwing protesters. There are also reports of rubber bullets being fired by troops. In East Jerusalem, there have scuffles with Israeli police pushing back hundreds of demonstrators outside the Old City. There’ve also been injuries in Gaza after Israeli forces opened fire on protesters who threw stones at Israeli army posts on the border.
