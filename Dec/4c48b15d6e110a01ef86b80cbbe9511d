                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Black Business Council says its stalwarts are at an advanced stage of an investigation into the disappearance of R5 million. The council announced the suspension of its president Danisa Baloyi on Monday after she was implicated. The money was a donation from the Airports Company South Africa in March this year. The Council's George Sebulela says the probe has been handed over to its stalwarts because of their experience. “The highly experienced, professional, reputable business persons are running with the investigation in conjunction with lawyers and audit firms.” He says at this stage, Baloyi is the only person implicated in the matter. “Dr Baloyi is not guilty until proven so, hence the suspension to clarify her role.” There has been no indication of who will assume the role of acting president, however, former COO Kganki Matabane has been now appointed CEO.
