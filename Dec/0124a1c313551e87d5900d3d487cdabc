Thirty-one-year-old Madihlare Tlailane stands accused of spiking a security officer at the premises' drink, that left her unconscious before suspects gained access to the facility. Two safes were ground open and an undisclosed amount of money was stolen during the hit. Hawks Nothern Cape spokesperson, Captain Philane Nkwalase, said: “Our security member that was on duty was assisting another lady and during that process her cold drink was spiked and she was left unconscious.” Meanwhile, in Springbok, two police officers accused of submitting fictitious financial claims are appearing in the Springbok Magistrates Court on Monday. The 45-year-old captain and 31-year-old administration officer, who resigned recently, stands accused of forming part of an investigation relating to fraudulent travel claims of around R 3.4 million.
