                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Sugar Association is changing its constitution to ensure greater inclusivity in the industry. The Sugar Association currently has two members, the Cane Growers' Association and the Sugar Millers’ Association. The new changes will see the reconfiguration of these two members to ensure they are more representative of the sector. The Sugar Association’s Cedric Mboyisa says the changes come into effect in April 2018. “The South African Sugar Association council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a Constitutional amendment which will make sure that the reconfigured members are more inclusive and representative.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
