                                            MMC for Social Services JP Smith says parents and caregivers should look out for early signs of diarrhoea, the risk of which increases during the hotter months.
                                         CAPE TOWN – The City of Cape Town has warned parents to monitor their children's hygiene practices with the onset of the diarrhoea season. “The important thing is to be vigilant for early signs of diarrhoea and knowing what to do. Health workers can only assist when a child is brought to the clinic so we rely heavily on parents and caregivers to act quickly before signs of dehydration present themselves.”  In November 2,100 diarrhoea cases were reported. Over the past financial year, 17 children under five years died as a result of diarrhoea compared to 170 in 2009/10.
