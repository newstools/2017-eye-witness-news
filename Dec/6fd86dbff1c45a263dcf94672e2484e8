                                         JOHANNESBURG- The venues for the inbound England tour against South Africa have been confirmed by the South African Rugby Union on Friday.  This will be the first-time that England tours South Africa in six years, with the last tour coming in 2012, when the Springboks beat the English 2-0, with the last Test ending in a draw. SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux says that England have re-established themselves as one of world rugby’s powerhouses in recent times.  “Under Eddie Jones, the English have re-established themselves as one of world rugby’s powerhouse and they have lost one Test match in two seasons.” Roux also says that facing England is exciting but is going to be hard too.  “Our history against England goes back more than a century and we are looking forward to welcoming them back to South Africa next year in what promises to be a tough tour.” Newlands will welcome England for the first time since 1998.  “In 2012, they played in Johannesburg, but it’s been 10 years since they last visited Bloemfontein, while the Test in Cape Town will be England’s first visit to the Mother City since 1998.” The tour schedule is as follows:  9 June: Emirates Airline Park, Johannesburg16 June: Toyota Stadium, Bloemfontein23 June: DHL Newlands, Cape Town
