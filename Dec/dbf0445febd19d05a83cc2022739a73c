The NGO has over the past few weeks conducted awareness campaigns in the area, alerting communities to dangers facing the youth, especially during the holiday season. Mitchells Plain has seen a series of violent and deadly crimes involving children over the year. The association's Joanie Fredericks says parents should always be aware of their children's whereabouts. “A lot more still needs to be done at family and community level in terms of keeping our children safe. The people that hurt our children are from within our families and communities, therefore, the solutions and preventive measures need to come from inside.”
