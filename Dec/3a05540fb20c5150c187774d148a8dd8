                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town's water crisis has worsened, with dam levels dropping and consumption increasing.  The much feared day zero has been brought closer to the 29 April. Only 34% of Capetonians are meeting the daily limitation of 87 litres of water per person. Mayoral spokesperson Zara Nicholson: "Only 34% of our residents are saving water. We need all residents to save. If consumption continues to rise, together with the very hot, windy conditions which increases evaporation losses, we can expect day zero to happen as soon as 18 March 2018."
