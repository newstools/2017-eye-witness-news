                                         CAPE TOWN - The United National Transport Union (Untu) has slammed Transnet as salary hike negotiations head for an impasse. The parastatal is offering a 6.5% increase.  The union wants a 12% hike for its members. It points out that in late October, Transnet boss Siyabonga Gama had boasted of a more than R37 billion increase in profits.  But due to the recent credit rating downgrades, its balance sheet has been hit hard. Untu general secretary Steve Harris says that bosses have until mid-January to come up with an improved offer or face a national strike. “We’ll get a mandate first and if that fails, we’ll declare the dispute in terms of legislation. We will ask the conciliator to issue a certificate of non-resolution. That will give us an opportunity to go on a legal strike.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
