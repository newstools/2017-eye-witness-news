                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town police are investigating the circumstances behind a car chase which led to the death of three people.  Officers reportedly came across a motorist in a bakkie in Khayelitsha driving recklessly on Friday and subsequently gave chase. During the suspects' apparent attempt to evade police two men were flung off the back of the bakkie before it crashed into another vehicle.  The police’s Noloyiso Rwexana says the surviving suspects were apprehended and will appear in court soon. “A case of possession of stolen property has been opened against the three suspects who were found in the bakkie. Charges of reckless and negligent driving and capable homicide were also opened for investigation.”
