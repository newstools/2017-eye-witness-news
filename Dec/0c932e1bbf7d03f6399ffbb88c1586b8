                                         JOHANNESBURG  - A Durban woman says her four-year-old child is now afraid to go to the movies after they were robbed at a Ster-Kinekor cinema at Gateway Mall. Melissa Malliah was robbed at knifepoint inside the movie house last month. Hers is the third tale of robbery in a Ster-Kinekor cinema in the last two months following incidents at Rosebank and East Gate malls. Malliah says she feels nothing has been done by authorities or Ster-Kinekor. “My cellphone was gone. I had R4,500 cash in my wallet. It was just gone. They found my bag two hours later and that’s what happened. My daughter refuses to go to the movies. She’s traumatised by this incident. She’s four-years-old.” Ster-Kinekor says it's working with police to investigate the robberies. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
