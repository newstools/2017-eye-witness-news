                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) has rejected the Water and Sanitation Department’s proposed tariff increases of more than 14%. The party presented the outcomes of its weekend central executive committee meeting on Sunday. It says that the proposed increases would have the biggest impact on working class and poor people. The Water and Sanitation Department last week announced plans to cut supply to around 30 defaulting municipalities which have racked up more than R10 million in debt. The Communist Party's Blade Nzimande has made it clear that they don’t agree with the decision. “This high-ended pronouncement fails to address the underlying problems of municipal sustainability as well as massive irregular spending in her (Minister Nomvula Mokonyane) own department.”
