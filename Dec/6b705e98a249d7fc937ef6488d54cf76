                                         CAPE TOWN - Many Capetonians have already been warned by the City of Cape Town about the possibility of their rates bill increasing in the new year. Although the city is waiting on the go-ahead by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, emails and letters have been sent to ratepayers sharing details about the drought charge. The city says it has to charge households this fee (on top of current municipal rates) to cover the R1 billion a year that’s needed to pay for drought interventions while dams recover. Residents whose properties are valued under R400,000 will be exempt from the tiered drought charge, which is set to be implemented in February.  The charges start at R25 for a property worth R400,000, all the way up to R2,800 for R50 million properties.  The city’s Johan van der Merwe said: “If approved, the charge will be valid from 1 February 2018 until 20 June 2020. It’s not a punitive charge, but it’s absolutely vital to fund our emergency water programme and water services.” Ratepayers are able to comment on the drought charge on the city’s website.
