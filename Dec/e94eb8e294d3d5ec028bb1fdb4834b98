                                         JOHANNESBURG - There’s intense speculation about whether the new national executive committee (NEC) will reflect a similar balance of power as the top six positions which saw a three-all draw between Cyril Ramaphosa’s camp and that of losing contender Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma This means the announcement of the African National Congress (ANC)’s 80 additional national executive committee members and Ramaphosa’s first speech as party leader are only likely to take place later on Wednesday.  The make-up of the new national executive committee will be critical for Ramaphosa.  The highest decision-making body of the ANC between conferences, it does so by consensus and he will need a significant majority to steer things. As new ANC president, Ramahosa will be in charge of driving the implementation of policy decisions taken, but he also wants to clean up corruption and steer the party along the path of renewal. Delegates were allowed to take lists of preferred names into the voting booths, and lists doing the rounds ahead of the vote showed little common ground between the Ramaphosa and Dlamini Zuma camps. Ramaphosa already has officials who do not share his vision or principles; a hybrid NEC might look like a unified leadership but could cause problems for him on the road ahead.
