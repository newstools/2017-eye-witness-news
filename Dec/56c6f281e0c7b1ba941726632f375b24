                                         JOHANNESBURG - Author of the President's Keeper's Jacques Pauw has confirmed that the South African Revenue Services (Sars) has opened a case against him. Pauw says the revenue service has served him with a notice of motion to obtain an order from the Western Cape High Court. It argues that Pauw contravened the Tax Administration Act by disclosing confidential taxpayer information in his controversial book. But Pauw says Sars laying charges against him only confirms the credibility of his book. The President’s Keepers alleges that millions of rands in taxpayers' money flowed into the bank accounts of spies and members of Jacob Zuma’s government. It also accuses Zuma of tax evasion. The author says he and his legal team will fight the matter. “They want an order from the Western Cape High Court that I’ve contravened the act. Now, what is interesting, they’ve laid charges against me at the Hatfield police, according to them. Now if they succeed in getting an order, what do they intend to do with it?” Sars says after seeking legal counsel, it's concluded that there are legal grounds to for both criminal and civil charges against the Pauw. Sars says in the book there is a blatant contravention of the law, in that an individual’s tax affairs are discussed and allegations are made that Sars commissioner Tom Moyane aided an individual to avoid paying taxes. A case has been opened at the Hatfield Police Station. Sars spokesperson Sandile Memela said: “We must remind ourselves that it is a criminal offence for anyone, including current and former Sars officials, to divulge or discuss an individual taxpayers’ affairs. This is stipulated by the Tax Administration Act of 2011.”
