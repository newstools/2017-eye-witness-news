                                         JOHANNESBURG - Amid concerns about the African National Congress' (ANC) resolution on land expropriation without compensation, Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says it is "not economically viable” and does not expand the wealth to poor South Africans. Heated discussions among ANC delegates on the issue ended up in an alleged shuffle revealed through video footage released by the Sunday Times. The party resolved that the Constitution must be amended to take land without paying for it. United Democratic Movement president Bantu Holomisa believes that the only reason the ANC took the decision to expropriate land without compensation is to win over Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) voters.  “I don’t think the ANC will implement that. It’s intended to disrupt the EFF on the issue of land.” Maimane agrees with Holomisa and says it will never work. In order to change the Constitution, the ANC needs a two-third majority in the National Assembly. On this it can rely on the EFF’s vote. Meanwhile, Congress of thr People president Mosiuoa Lekota says it’s blatant populism on behalf of the ANC. “Because if you are going to take land and give it to people who don’t farm, they’ll walk away from it.” The EFF says it will only respond next year.
