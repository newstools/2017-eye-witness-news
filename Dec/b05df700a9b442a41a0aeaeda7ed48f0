                                         MPUMALANGA - With exactly two weeks to go until the African National Congress (ANC)’s national elective conference gets underway, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma is tailing Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa with presidential nominations. The ANC in Mpumalanga on Friday endorsed Dlamini Zuma to take over as president of the party. Dlamini Zuma received 123 nominations while her rival Ramaphosa was short of just six votes at 117. The party held its provincial general council at the Mbombela stadium. A song titled Unity was the order of the day. Some 223 delegates abstained by writing unity on the nomination forms. Now with those votes consolidated, Dlamini Zuma has been named the preferred candidate but provincial chair David Mabuza says a vote for her at the elective conference in two weeks will be a fractional decision. “I’ll take this view of the province to other provinces and we’ll discuss with them.” Mabuza is calling for thorough negotiations in an effort to elect a credible and united leadership at the conference.
