                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has emphasised that it has prioritised an investigation into claims of maladministration in the City of Cape Town.  Last month Craig Kesson, the executive director in the mayor's office, submitted a report for further investigation.  Mayor Patricia de Lille has been accused of covering up the claims. The DA’s James Selfe says the document is not a forensic report and the contents are only allegations at this stage. “I think they’re overstating it. It’s a report that makes a series of allegations and raises a number of serious questions. The independent investigator has 30 days to investigate all these claims.” In the report it is alleged that the city had lost millions in the MyCiTi bus fares and some officials are implicated in tender irregularities.  Meanwhile, divisions in the DA in Cape Town may cost the party votes in the 2019 election, according to a political analyst Erwin Schwella. Schwella explains: “If it’s not resolved, it will impact the quality of governance in the city, which is a pity because the city is well governed. It will eventually impact the support for the DA.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
