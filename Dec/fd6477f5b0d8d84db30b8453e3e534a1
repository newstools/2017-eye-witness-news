Last season’s runners-up, the Lions unveiled two jerseys, a home and away strip that comprises of the traditional red and white colours the franchise has donned for many years. The Durban-based Sharks also unveiled two strips that were inspired by the fans and designed in Durban. The Stormers opted for a black away jersey that has a snug collar, and a traditional blue and white home strip. The 2018 Super Rugby season has been reduced from 18 to 15 teams, with the Cheetahs, Kings and Australia’s Western Force cut from the competition. The competition starts on 17 February when the Stormers host the Jaguares in Cape Town.
