                                         JOHANNESBURG - Outspoken former African National Congress (ANC) MP Makhosi Khoza says her newly formed political party seeks to bring change to South Africa’s politics and governance by contesting the upcoming 2019 general elections. Khoza launched the African Democratic Change (ADC) in Braamfontein on Friday. The organisation is holding a conference this weekend aimed at adopting the party’s identity and principles ahead of its first policy conference next year. Khoza has vowed not to repeat the same mistakes made by the ANC. “One of the things that I think has been a major problem within the ruling party is not so much that they’re not good men and women but that leaders are not principled.” WATCH: African Democratic Change launched  HONEST LEADERSHIP Khoza says her newly formed political party plans to win elections based on integrity and honest leadership. The new party is born out of a merger with civil society organisations and members from other political parties. Khoza has described her new party as a new force of change that will work to solve problems faced by South Africans, especially the poor. Khoza says honest leadership is one the most important factors that will sustain the party. “Ours is not about numbers. Yes, we want to win the elections, but we want to with the elections on a moral and ethical platform.” Khoza resigned from the ANC and Parliament earlier this year after being targeted for speaking out against corruption within the governing party.
