                                         MBOMBELA – The South African Communist Party (SACP) in Mpumalanga has urged voting delegates going to the elective conference next week to not be tempted to accept bribes. The party is currently holding its imbizo at the Elijah Mango college outside Mbombela. Hundreds of the party constituents have been bussed there. While the African National Congress’s (ANC) provincial general council has convened to consolidate policies in Mbombela the SACP is holding an event, seemingly a send-off for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.  Some women dressed in the ANC Women’s League regalia have been singing.  Provincial SACP leader Lucky Mbuyani says: “We are tired of these things comrades, 2018 shall be strengthening our campaign of ensuring Zuma steps down.” He says this event has also served as a fundraiser for delegates to help with funds for the conference fearing money may be withheld.
