                                         JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways (SAA) has issued a statement reassuring its Muslim customers that the airline institutes the "highest Halaal standards" when serving food. This follows reports in which staff at the food company that caters to the national airline claimed their "food is not Halaal". SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali says the catering subsidiary of the airline which also caters for SA Express and all SAA corporate functions, is Muslim Judicial Council  compliant. “In our view, this seems to be the work of a few disgruntled employees who’s intention is nothing but to bring the company into disrepute and we reject these claims as baseless as ones that are motivated by nothing but malice.” Meanwhile, The Sunday Times is reporting that SAA may be moved from National Treasury to the Transport Department. The country’s top banks, however, have warned that they may recall some R8 billion that SAA owes to the banks if the airline is removed from Treasury. The banks and Investec are believed to have written to SAA introducing the new loan agreement that changes to its shareholder would trigger a recall.
