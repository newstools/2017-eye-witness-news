CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has praised its water and sanitation workers for their diligence in keeping wastage in its network to a minimum. Engineers worked overnight this weekend to repair a bulk water pipe in Paarden Island. The city says these large-scale repairs are one way the municipality is trying to prevent further water losses during the ongoing water crisis. The Western Cape is grappling with the worst drought in decades, with several areas being declared disaster zones, and others implementing level five water restrictions. Cape town water and sanitation Farouk Robertson said: “Our teams are working around the clock, I can tell you. If you have the opportunity to witness a team working on these pipelines especially the burst pipelines at night, you’d be surprised at the quality of workmanship that goes into it. They go beyond the call of duty in terms of trying to restore that water supply.”
