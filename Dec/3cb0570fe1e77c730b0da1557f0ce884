                                         JOHANNESBURG - While the country waits to hear the outcome of the African National Congress (ANC)'s national conference, business leaders will be seeking clarity from Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe at Wednesday morning’s business breakfast. Radebe is due to address the Progressive Business Forum at Nasrec. The minister is expected to deliver the keynote address on Wednesday. Like other ministers who’ve addressed business leaders this week, he may focus on the economy. The business community has raised concerns about support for SMMEs, the slow economic growth and investor confidence. Radebe may also be joined by newly elected treasurer-general Paul Mashatile, as it’s tradition for the treasurer of the party to speak at these breakfasts. This is the last breakfast briefing organised by the Progressive Business Forum. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
