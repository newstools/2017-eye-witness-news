                                         CAPE TOWN - Opposition parties in the Cape Town council say the Democratic Alliance (DA) must come clean regarding allegations against Mayor Patricia de Lille that have led to her suspension from the party. The DA has given De Lille until Monday to provide reasons why she should not resign. Last week, the African National Congress (ANC) attempted to have a motion of no confidence tabled against De Lille, but the speaker said proper process had not been followed. The DA says it can’t divulge the nature of the findings against De Lille until she’s been given the opportunity to respond. De Lille was investigated by a DA sub-committee after a complaint from Mayco member JP Smith that she shut down a special investigating unit within the city. It’s believed De Lille was of the view that the unit was overstepping its mandate, while others saw it as an attempt to block investigations into councillors. But ANC councillor Xolani Sotashe says the problem in the City of Cape Town is not De Lille, but the DA’s way of governance. “The DA’s been embarrassed because what they’ve done in the City of Cape Town is to professionalise corruption.” The African Christian Democratic Party’s Grant Haskin says the party will support a motion to remove De Lille. “The mayor has proven herself over a number of years now in the best interests of Capetonians, and we believe it’s time for new, accountable leadership in the city.” The Economic Freedom Fighters says the allegations against De Lille have exposed the DA for trying to hide corruption and wrongdoing.
