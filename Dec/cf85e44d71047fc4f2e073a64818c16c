                                         JOHANNESBURG - The United National Transport Union says it has not yet reached an agreement on salaries with Transnet, although there is an offer on the table. The union is demanding a 12% salary increases every year for the next three years and increases in medical subsidy and housing allowance. But Transnet is offering a 6,5 % increase for 2018, 7,25% for 2019 and 8% for 2020, with no increase in medical aid and housing allowance. The union is also demanding an additional 2% wage increase for employees who earn less than R100 000 per annum and no retrenchments for the next three years. General Secretary Steve Harris said: “Transnet’s biggest argument because they’ve been downgraded to junk status they are not in a position to make a better offer. As labour, we have decided to take this to our constituency and we’ve got to revert back to the employer.” He says if the offer is rejected by their members, a decision on a protected strike will be made. “Obviously if we don't accept that then we will have to declare dispute in terms of non-resolution to the bargaining council which will revert to conciliation and we will then be issued with a certificate which will allow us to go to a legal strike.”
