                                         PRETORIA - The Public Protector’s legal team has told the High Court that while it may find she acted inappropriately, it does not mean she acted in bad faith. This was among the submission in the Reserve Bank, Absa and Treasury’s review of Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s investigation of the apartheid-era Bankorp bailout. The Reserve Bank has asked the court to declare that Mkhwebane abused her office and breach the Constitution. Advocate Paul Kennedy says the court would have to find Mkhwebane acted in bad faith in order to rule she abused her office. “Even if she acted inappropriately by having, for examples, meetings with the presidency and the State Security Agency, that doesn’t justify finding that she acted out of bad faith.” Kennedy says his client acted in good faith. “There cannot be any doubts either that she was well motivated and in good faith.” Kennedy has accused the Reserve Bank of trying to lay the groundwork to have Mkhwebane removed from office.
