                                         JOHANNESBURG - Moody's has downgraded Steinhoff to CAA1 on review for a further downgrade. The agency says that it's facing the probability of a further downgrade. This is because it's concerned about Steinhoff's liquidity levels, which could prove insufficient to sustain its European operations in the near term. Earlier this month, Moodyâ€™s downgraded Steinhoff International by four notches. The company is under investigation in Germany following allegations of fraud. Locally, the Financial Services Board and Parliament are also investigating.
