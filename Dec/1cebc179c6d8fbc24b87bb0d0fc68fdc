                                         CAPE TOWN - Eight people have been arrested for copper cable theft after raids at several scrap dealers in the Netreg-Bonteheuwel area. Metrorail’s protection services, along with police, on Thursday arrested the suspects and issued fines worth R10,000. Vandalism and cable theft led to the suspension of the central line for days this week. Transport MEC Donald Grant said: “We’re very hopeful with the raids that were made at various scrap dealers on Thursday, between Langa and Philippi area, that the people who are accessing and stealing the copper cables will soon be brought to book.” Meanwhile, a summit is being planned to help find solutions to Cape Town’s perennial train problems. Two weeks ago, the City of Cape Town’s Brett Herron experienced the service first-hand to get a better idea of what tens of thousands of commuters have to endure almost daily.

Myburgh says that a solution is needed. “This is why the summit is taking place so that everyone can play a role in finding a solution. Something drastically needs to be done and we’ll only find a solution if we do this together.” Additional reporting by Monique Mortlock. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
