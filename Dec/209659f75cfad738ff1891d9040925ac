                                         CAPE TOWN - Metrorail commuters travelling on the northern line can expect more delays on Friday. Thursday was a hellish journey for thousands as cable theft in Kuils River caused disruptions. Metrorail has told commuters to make alternative travel arrangements due to delays of more than 60 minutes. Metrorail’s Riana Scott said: “The Monte Vista and northern line are operating their usual routes, but we might still expect residual delays of up to 60 minutes due to signal and equipment failure between Elsies River and Parow.”   (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
