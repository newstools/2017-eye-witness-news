                                         CAPE TOWN - The body of a Cape Town girl who died while on a school trip in Vietnam is expected to be repatriated back home.  Shannen Rustin, a grade 11 learner at Westerford High School, died on Friday.  Rustin was part of a group of pupils taking part in a school’s world challenge expedition in Hanoi. The details around her death are still unclear, but it's believed she died while the group was hiking in Sapa Valley.  Western cape education MEC Debbie Schafer said, “I can’t imagine what the parents are feeling, I’m really sorry and they must make use of all resources available to them like counselling.”
