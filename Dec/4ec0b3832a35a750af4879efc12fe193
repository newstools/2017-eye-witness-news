                                         CAPE TOWN - The Cape Winelands District Municipality says the fire on the Bainskloof Pass has been contained. The fire started at around 10am on Saturday and grew out of control due to gale force winds. At least 2,800 hectares of five-year-old fynbos have been destroyed. The municipality’s Jo-Anne Otto said: “A current ground crew of around 63 firefighters will stay on the scene overnight to extinguish flare-ups. Meanwhile, the three helicopters that were deployed for water bombing, as well as the majority of support vehicles, will return to base.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
