                                         JOHANNESBURG - The family of former MK veteran Laloo Chiba says the late struggle stalwart had requested President Jacob Zuma to step down. In a letter his family says was written by the Robben Island prisoner last year, Chiba details how Zuma’s leadership has demoralized ANC members. The letter was read at Chiba’s memorial in Lenasia yesterday. Chiba’s family says his letter was directed to the president last year and cc’d Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Gwede Mantashe and Jesse Duarte who was also at the memorial. But upon his death on Friday, his son-in-law Rashid Moosa says they felt it was time the world knew. “On behalf of my family, I appeal to you in all sincerity to step down with immediate affect in the interests of our people.” Chiba’s letter on the president echoes the sentiments expressed by his close friend the late Ahmed Kathrada in a letter released before his passing.
