                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Johannesburg says its motion for the provision of safe and affordable accommodation for previously disadvantaged students has received support from the Johannesburg City Council. The party says it’s concerned about the lack of accommodation for university students in the city, which leads to some students sleeping at places which are not conducive to living and studying. The red beret says over 50,000 registered students who applied for student accommodation at accredited institutions of higher learning in Johannesburg couldn’t be housed in the 2017 academic year. It’s called on the metro to refurbish and convert some identified bad buildings in the CBD to affordable students’ accommodation. EFF’s Musa Novela said: “We tabled the motion and it was supported by all the parties represented in the Johannesburg City Council. And now the resolution of the council, what’s left is for the executives to implement and ensure that we make our contribution to the education of all those who come to Johannesburg to study.”
