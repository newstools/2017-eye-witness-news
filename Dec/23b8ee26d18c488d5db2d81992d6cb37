                                         JOHANNESBURG - Striking Shoprite and Checkers workers say if management does not respond to their grievances within seven days they will take further action. Yesterday, thousands of workers, belonging to Cosatu affiliate Saccawu, went on a nationwide strike over working conditions. A memorandum was handed to representatives from the stores demanding a guaranteed minimum number of working hours for part-time workers and the provision of safe and reliable transport for late-shift workers. Saccawu's Colin Tyhalidikazi said, “In Gauteng, Free State and Western Cape there are workers who were raped while coming to work or leaving work. Some were killed. Our members must be safe and when they go back home there must be transport waiting for them.”
