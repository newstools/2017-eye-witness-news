                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has called on ANC delegates to recall President Jacob Zuma at Saturday’s national conference. Late struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada wrote to Zuma in 2016 asking him to step down for the good of the country. ANC members are expected to choose the party’s new leader and executive committee at the conference. The foundation’s Zaakirah Vadi says delegates have the opportunity to remove the man at the centre of state capture allegations. “President Zuma has come to represent and symbolise much of what's wrong in the society. He’s the head of the state that's fraught with repeated scandals around state capture, corruption, maladministration and disregard for the Constitution.”
