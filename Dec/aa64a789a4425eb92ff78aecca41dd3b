                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has decried the African Democratic Change (ADEC) for appropriating its colours. ADEC was offically launched as a political party on December 1 by former ANC Member of Parliament Makhosi Khoza. Khoza left the ANC earlier this year after being targeted for speaking out against corruption within the ruling party. Her new party consists of a merger of civil society organisations and members from other political parties. The ANC on Monday welcomed the launch of ADEC but hit out at the party for "blatantly" appropriating "the colours of the ANC into its logo". pic.twitter.com/cgVaxxBuky  In a statement, the ANC accused ADEC of attempting to attract supporters by subterfuge, describing the party's use of the ANC's colours as a "paucity of ideas at best, and political chicanery at worst."

"Undoubtedly the ADEC has taken this decision with the possibility of contesting the national elections in 2019 and thus intending to confuse voters who rightly associate the colors with that of the ANC. This undermines the spirit of free and fair elections. Accordingly, the ANC has briefed it's legal team to lodge an objection with the Independent Electoral Commission against this blatant mischief."
