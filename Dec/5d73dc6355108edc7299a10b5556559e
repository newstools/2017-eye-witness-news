                                         CAPE TOWN - The traffic department says that a South African National Defence Force (SANDF) helicopter has crashed in Worcester near the side of the Huguenot Tunnel on the N1 highway. One person has sustained serious injuries following a South African air force helicopter crash on the n1 highway between Worcester and Paarl in the Western Cape. Seven others have sustained minor to moderate injuries during the accident. The du Toitskloof pass and Hugeunot tunnel have been closed to traffic. Er24 spokesperson Russell Meiring says: “ER24 paramedics along with several other services arrived on the scene to find a large helicopter lying across the entire highway. Debris from the highway was spread across the scene. Paramedics on the scene provided the seriously injured with advanced life support intervention before they were transported to the nearest hospital for further care.” At the same time, the Western Cape traffic department says it is believed that eight occupants were inside the helicopter at the time of the crash. The Du Toitskloof Pass and Huguenot Tunnel have both been closed following the crash. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa: "Currently we have a situation just outside the Huguenot tunnel next to the N1 where a chopper went down. The chopper struck overhead power cables. We're urging motorists coming from Cape Town to please make use of the Sir Lowry's Pass, Grabouw-Villiersdorp road towards Worcester or from Cape Town via Paarl, Wellington, Tulbagh, Wolseley to get back to Worcester."
