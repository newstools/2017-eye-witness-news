                                         CAPE TOWN - The South African wine industry is bracing itself for what might be the smallest harvest in more than a decade. According to a survey done by the industry body SA Wine Industry Information and Systems, wineries are predicting a much smaller 2018 crop compared to 2017 and possibly the smallest since 2005.  Vingro’s Hanno van Schalkwyk says the drought is one of the major reasons for the reduction in crops for 2018. “As a result of very little water resources being made to wine producers, all the regions are affected.”
