                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng’s suspended Health HOD Dr Barney Selebano has conceded that the lives of psychiatric patients were compromised and that he and his team were negligent when implementing the Life Esidimeni marathon project.  Hundred-and-forty-three mentally ill people died after being moved to ill-equipped NGOs by the provincial Health Department allegedly to save costs.  Selebano is testifying for a second day at the arbitration hearings in Parktown.  Negligence has featured strongly as the cause of death of the 143 psychiatric patients in Health Ombudsman professor Malegapuru Makgoba’s damning report.  This is what Selebano admitted to on Wednesday as he told retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke that he takes responsibility as Gauteng Health Department head. The doctor is being questioned about receiving several warnings from clinicians’ psychiatrists and many other professionals in the mental health fraternity but failing to heed the warnings.
