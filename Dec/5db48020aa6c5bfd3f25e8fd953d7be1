                                         JOHANNESBURG - Parents at a school in Soweto have rejected the appointment of a new principal, saying they feel the decision was imposed on them. Learning was disrupted at Noordgesig Primary School on Friday where parents protested against the appointment. A new headmaster was supposed to start his first day on Friday morning, two years after his predecessor was sacked amid a circumcision scandal Parents at the school say they feel disrespected by the appointment of a new principal, as the acting headmistress was doing a good job and there was no reason to remove her. In a statement, they refer to the new headmaster as “a Bantu African” but insist they are not rejecting him on the basis of race. Their representative Roseline Harrison said: “I mean if you go to the African school, you won’t find a coloured principal in their school. In their school, you find that its only Africans strictly.” She says they don’t understand why the department did not promote other competent teachers from the school. A meeting will be held between at the school on Monday. DEPARTMENT INTERVENES The Gauteng Education Department says it won't tolerate any form of racism in schools. Officials from the department were sent to intervene at the school after parents shut the school gates. Parents claim that coloured teachers have been sidelined at the school. The department's Steve Mabona said: “We don’t understand why now you will have people who will want to complain about the appointment of the principal without raising genuine reasons because you cannot raise an issue of whether one is African.”
