                                         CAPE TOWN - The Monday blues await already beleaguered train commuters. Train services are in disarray once again. All trips on the busy central line have been suspended. This has left thousands of commuters in the lurch. Metrorail explains it had no choice but to suspend services due to months of vandalism and cable theft in the Bonteheuwel, Netreg and Nyanga area. At the same time, delays of up to 60 minutes are expected on the northern line.  Commuters using the southern line should also brace for an extended travel time of between 15-20 minutes.  No buses have been made available by the rail company. Last week, the City of Cape Town invited business leaders for a train trip. WATCH: CT Transport official experiences Metrorail service first-hand  It wants bosses to get first-hand experience of what ordinary workers have to endure on the city’s train lines. The city’s Brett Herron, who is spearheading the municipality's plan to take over the management of the rail network, took a train trip from Khayelitsha to Cape Town on Thursday. “I need to bring corporate leaders to do his trip next week. They need to see what their employees go through every day. My next step is to bring the right people to do this trip with me and get the next step of our rail plan into action.” Additional reporting by Monique Mortlock. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
