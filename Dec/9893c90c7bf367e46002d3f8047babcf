                                         CAPE TOWN - Rural land rights activists say they want the African National Congress (ANC)’s national conference to seriously reconsider government’s stance on land reform. They say rural dwellers are increasingly losing out on their rights to land because in their view, current legislation is empowering traditional leaders instead. In November, former President Kgalema Motlanthe submitted a review of key legislation to Parliament. His high-level panel proposed the Restitution of Land Rights Act and the Communal Property Associations Act be urgently amended to address land imbalances. The panel led by Motlanthe found land rights provided for in the Constitution are not being effectively promoted, enforced or upheld. Now, a think tank of civil organisations meeting in Cape Town say they want the ANC conference to give meaningful consideration to the panel’s findings and to adopt its proposals. The Alliance for Rural Democracy’s Constance Mogale says there’s more to land reform than expropriation. “Challenges in the land reform will not be solved through one programme which is restitution, but we need to look at other legs like redistribution and communal land tenure.” The advocacy groups say Parliament is adopting legislation without proper consultation with those it will affect.
