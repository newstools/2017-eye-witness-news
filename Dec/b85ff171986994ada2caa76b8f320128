                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini says that she is proud that there were three female candidates nominated for the party’s leader this year. The women's league president says that this is despite Baleka Mbete endorsing Cyril Ramaphosa for ANC president on Saturday night.  Dlamini says that in this current patriarchal society, she’s proud that women have taken a step forward. She says that for the first time there are three female candidates for the ANC presidency and despite the outcome of the conference this alone is an achievement. "We are not going to chaperone people and force them to nominate their candidates, what we are proud of is that we've moved a step further, we did not chicket out as we did in the North West." Dlamini says that whoever wins, she’ll support, because that’s the culture of the ANC. WATCH: #ANC54 Bathabile Dlamini: We did not chicken out
