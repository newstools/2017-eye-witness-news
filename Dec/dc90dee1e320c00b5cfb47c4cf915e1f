                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa and the rest of the top six are expected to face pressure to sack Jacob Zuma as head of state early next year. It’s understood some of Ramaphosa’s backers want Zuma to be recalled after their victory at the ANC’s 54th national conference. But analysts say it won't be that easy to get rid of Zuma because some of his supporters have also made it into the top leadership of the party. Political analyst David Maimela says the real test for Ramaphosa and the rest of the ANC leadership's starts now. “What will be more important will be what happens from January. I hear this buzzword 'unity'. But what is it that really divides them?” Head of political futures consultancy Daniel Silke says the NEC has no choice but to get rid of Zuma. “The ANC desperately needs to distance itself from its immediate past. That is really its weak link and that all centred around the presidency of Jacob Zuma.” LISTEN: Mufamadi: 'ANC can break free from Zuma stranglehold'  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
