                                         JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the United Nations as a “house of lies” ahead of a vote on Thursday on a draft resolution calling on the United States to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. “The State of Israel totally rejects this vote, even before (the resolution’s) approval,” Netanyahu said in public remarks.  “Jerusalem is our capital and we will continue to build there, and foreign embassies, led by the United States, will move to Jerusalem. It will happen.”
