                                         CAPE TOWN – Cape Town Mayor Paricia de Lille has pleaded with residents and visitors to remember to conserve water while they enjoy the festive season. The city says less than half a million households in Cape Town are using less than the prescribed 87 litres of water per person per day. This means the city is missing its savings target and at that rate, the water supply system will fail on 29 April. “While we’re on holiday, the one thing we cannot relax is our water saving efforts. Please continue to save water and work with the city to avoid day zero.”
