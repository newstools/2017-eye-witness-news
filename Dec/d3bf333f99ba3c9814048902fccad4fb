                                         CAPE TOWN - The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) has ruled in favour of a single mother seeking a school fee exemption based on her income. Michelle Saffer took the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) to court after Fish Hoek High School refused to give her a fee exemption unless she provided details of her former spouse’s income, even though they were estranged. The High Court in 2016 maintained the South African Schools Act holds parents jointly liable for the payment of school fees. On Wednesday the SCA set aside the department’s refusal to grant Saffer a fee exemption, saying public schools may not grant a conditional fee exemption to the custodial parent if one parent refuses or fails to provide their income details. The Equal Education Law Centre’s Nurina Ally said: “The court has vindicated Saffer’s rights, confirming that she was mistreated and her rights were violated. It also highlighted the burden single mothers face when seeking fee exemption in public schools.” The WCED’s Milicent Merton said: “The Western Cape Education Department takes note of the judgment and will consider the implication thereof.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
