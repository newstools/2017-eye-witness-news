                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa says emergency services workers will be on standby for  heavy downpours in low lying areas. The Water and Sanitation Department has previously said it’s expecting significant rain this festive season and Ramokgopa has promised officials are ready to safeguard residents. Ramokgopa says the province’s Emergency Medical Services workers are ready to ensure residents are safe this festive season. “There’s a joint disaster and preparedness management team which is led by the Department Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs.” Gauteng EMS CEO Arnold Mmolotane says they are working with the South African Weather Service for a preventative approach instead of a reactive one. “We have an ongoing disaster forum that’s going proactively with South African Weather Service to notify communities that might be affected.” Meanwhile, the Water and Sanitation Department says the recent downpours have yielded positive results for the 14 dams that are essential for Gauteng.
