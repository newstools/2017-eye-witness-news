                                         JOHANNESBURG - The ANC and lawyers for 68 voters who lodged a dispute at the party's elective conference will now meet in the new year to find a solution. Lawyers for those involved met with the ANC at Luthuli House in Johannesburg yesterday. Ace Magushule beat Senzo Mchunu by 24 votes to be secretary-general and this was later adjusted to nine votes when 15 additional votes were allocated to Mchunu after a recount. The 68 were allowed to vote, but their votes were set aside due to credential irregulates. At the time of the announcement at the conference, Mchunu approached the podium to take a look at the numbers. This was because he had received overwhelming support from the branches in the run up to the conference. All parties have agreed to deal with the issue in the new year.
