                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Institute of Directors in Southern Africa says company directors could face criminal sanctions if they've failed to perform their duties. The institute says recent reports about global retailer Steinhoff, EOH and MultiChoice  bring these duties directly under the spotlight. Steinhoff lost about 90% of its stock value on the JSE after CEO Markus Jooste stepped down last week amid allegations of fraudulent transactions. The Federation of Unions of South Africa has now questioned why the CFO of Steinhoff did not resign. The institute's Parmi Natesan said: “Directors could be subject to criminal sanction like fines, jail time and even disqualification from serving as a director in future if they fail to perform these duties.  "However, I think it’s important to note that these duties and potential liabilities should not prevent directors from making the necessary bold decisions that are often required to drive growth.” At the same time, Reuters is reporting that Steinhoff is now considering selling stakes worth a combined R19 billion in local companies to help plug the liquidity gap at the retailer.
