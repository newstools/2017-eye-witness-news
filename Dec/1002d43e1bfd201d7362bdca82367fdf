                                         PRETORIA - As European leaders meeting in Brussels discuss forcing European Union (EU) members to accept asylum seekers, more than 900 migrants rescued off the Libyan coast have arrived in Italy. Chairman of the EU summit Donald Tusk says mandatory quotas are ineffective and highly divisive. The EU is committed to reaching a deal on accepting migrants by June. Poland and neighbours Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia are refusing to accept asylum seekers. They say they cannot accommodate large numbers of people from different cultural and religious backgrounds. In any event, the migrants are more keen to settle in Western European countries. Tusk, whoâ€™s a former Polish prime minister, has his work cut out. Driving a deal that will ease the pressure on Italy, Spain and other Mediterranean countries inundated with migrants from Africa.
