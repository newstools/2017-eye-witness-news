                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament says National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete is in the process of determining what action to take against African National Congress (ANC) MP Mervyn Dirks. Dirks is accused of insulting fellow parliamentarian Priscilla Mantashe during a fiery session in the National Assembly on Thursday. After denying he’d done anything wrong he then showed the Democratic Alliance (DA) the middle finger, he was eventually asked to leave the House. Parliament’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said: “It’s particularly concerning because Parliament and the rest of society are currently marking 16 Days of Activism, where every South African, including men, in particular, are urged to promote a conduct that seeks to protect the right of women.” The ANC has also been asked to look into the matter.
