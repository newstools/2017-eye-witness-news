                                         JOHANNESBURG - Broadcasting regulator Icasa says its council will meet on Tuesday to discuss whether it will investigate MultiChoice. The Democratic Alliance revealed last week that minutes from an SABC board meeting  show MultiChoice sought to pay the national broadcaster R100 million in exchange for its influence over government's position on set-top boxes. The opposition party says this also supports allegations that ANN7 was paid by MultiChoice for similar influence and asked Icasa to investigate. Icasa's Paseka Maleka said: “At the moment, I can’t confirm whether a decision will be made before the end of the year. However, the council has a meeting every Tuesday where these issues will be discussed.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
