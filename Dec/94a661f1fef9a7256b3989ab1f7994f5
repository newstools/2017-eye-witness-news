                                         PARYS - As the ANC in the Free state prepares to hold its elective conference today, it’s confirmed that not all the branches that the Bloemfontein High Court ordered to rerun their general meetings have done so. Last month, the court ruled that branch meetings held in four regions breached the ANC constitution and ordered that the provincial party’s elective conference cannot go ahead until the unlawful branch general meetings are rerun.  Free State ANC secretary William Bulwana says only 28 of the 29 branches have rerun their meetings as ordered by the court. “The last remaining is sitting at 9am. They are still busy and we will get a full report when they are finished.” If the last branch currently sitting doesn’t rerun it’s meeting successfully, that may pose a legal challenge to this conference. But Bulwana says they have a plan. “If it doesn’t then we will write affidavit because it has failed twice.” The provincial party expects at over 600 delegates will attend the conference. But it’s unclear if just like with the provincial general council, some branches will boycott this gathering.
