In doing so, Laureus Sport for Good contributes to the peacemaking in the region using sport. The Peres Centre for Peace in Tel Aviv has been a leader in building social cohesion among the community. Despite ongoing violence and political setbacks, the Peres Centre has been able to expand its influence in the Middle East by finding an understanding between Arab and Jewish children through sport. Through their soccer programme, which has involved over 20,000 kids, Jewish and Arab children are brought together where an understanding and appreciation of each other's cultures has been achieved. Soccer has helped to build bridges between the two cultures and helps overcome traditional prejudices on both sides. The soccer programme has been recognised globally, including numerous awards and partnerships with big European clubs. The programme's headquarters was founded by Nobel Peace Laureate and former Israeli President Shimon Peres.
