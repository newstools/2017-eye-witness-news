                                         CAPE TOWN - A Dutch fugitive convicted of selling weapons to former Liberian president Charles Taylor, will remain in custody after he was arrested in Cape Town. Augustinus Kouwenhoven was arrested yesterday following a police raid in the mother city.  He has since appeared in the Cape Town Magistrates Court where the matter was postponed until next week for a bail application. Reports suggest he was convicted by the Dutch Appeal Court for being an accessory to war crimes and for selling weapons to Taylor, during civil wars. Judgment was handed down in absentia against him in April and he was sentenced to 19 years. His lawyer Gary Eisenberg said, “The National Prosecuting Authority made the decision to have my client remanded pending bail hearing on Thursday.”
