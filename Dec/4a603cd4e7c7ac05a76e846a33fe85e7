The army says the operation to remove Robert Mugabe from power largely achieved its goals and the army will now hand over all policing duties to the police. JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwean media is reporting the end of the military operation that facilitated the resignation of former president Robert Mugabe and the subsequent appointment of Emmerson Mnangagwa as interim president. Concerns had been raised over the continued presence of the army on the streets of Zimbabwe nearly three weeks after Mugabe s resignation. The Zimbabwean defence force has announced at a media briefing that the military takeover dubbed Operation Restore Legacy has come to an end. The Herald newspaper has quoted army commander Lieutenant-General Philip Valerio Sibanda as saying the operation largely achieved its goals and the army will now hand over all policing duties to the police. During the military operation, Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri was confined, along with other key figures, including former finance minister Ignatius Chombo who was recently arrested on charges of criminal nuisance. Earlier, concerns had been raised over the failure of the soldiers to return to the barracks, with some reports of rogue soldiers assaulting civilians. Sibanda has urged the police to carry out their duties diligently and called for peace ahead of the 2018 elections.
