                                         MPUMALANGA - The ANC Mpumalanga executive committee has moved to distance itself from any intimidation of branch delegates who are en route to the elective conference at the weekend. Despite that, some delegates have come out to say they have been offered bribes to vote in favour of presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. A delegate says he was offered a mere R150. He also alleges that there have been death threats and other tactics to try ensuring that he complies with the stance of other branches voting for Dlamini Zuma. However, the Mpumalanga ANC’s Sasekani Manzini has denied such incidents took place. “There are allegations but I can’t confirm that I have seen them in the province.” On Friday, several branches gathered at the ANC offices in Mbombela demanding some of their delegates be removed from the provincial list to be reinstated. It is understood that most of those queries have been resolved at this stage. (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
