                                         CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) is still gunning for Mayor Patricia de Lille.  But it’s proposed motion of no confidence in her will not be tabled next week.  The city council's Speaker, Dirk Smit, says that the notice is defective as it doesn’t comply with municipal rules. “Every note of motion shall be in writing in a form of draft proposal and shall be submitted to the Speaker. Such notice shall be signed by the members submitting it and by the members seconding them.” But the Democratic Alliance’s arch rival in the city isn’t deterred. The ANC’s Xolani Sotashe says: “I have seen the response from the Speaker and for me it’s just a question of compliance.  “I have advised the Chief Whip of the ANC just to correct whatever is required to be corrected and then resubmit the motion so that it can be tabled next week Tuesday.”
