                                         MBOMBELA - Final preparations for the African National Congress (ANC) Mpumalanga provincial general council are underway at the Mbombela Stadium.  Members from over 700 branches are expected to consolidate nominations ahead of the party’s elective conference later this month.  The province will then make an announcement on its preferred presidential candidates and other nominees to fill the top six positions. The ANC in Gauteng and the North West will also hold their general councils on Friday. Mpumalanga has had its fair share of controversies this year with questions asked about its rapid growth in the last five years. This province went on to overtake the Eastern Cape in membership numbers, becoming the second largest after KwaZulu-Natal. Presidential hopefuls, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa both enjoy support in the province, making it unclear who will emerge with the most votes. Police and the ANC’s military wing, the MKMVA, are already here at the stadium to provide security. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
