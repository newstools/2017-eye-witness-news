                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has urged residents living at the Glebelands Hostel to collaborate with the police to fight crime. Mbalula has officially launched a satellite police station at the infamous KwaZulu-Natal hostel that’s been linked to the deaths of 95 people since 2014. The Moerane Commission of Inquiry investigating political killings in the province has also heard that hitmen are also living at the residence Mbalula says officers have been well trained to deal with the high rate of killings. “You come to the police station as a victim and you leave the police station not as a victim because you feel protected by the law, you leave this place as a survivor.”
