                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says his passion for educating the young is what lead to him declining a nomination to serve as a member in the African National Congress (ANC)'s National Executive Committee (NEC). Lesufi was nominated at the ANC's conference this week to serve in the party’s highest decision-making body. Many took to social media wanting to know why. Lesufi says he is humbled to have been nominated as an NEC member, but declined to focus on education in Gauteng. “I declined purely because of my work commitments in Gauteng, I really feel we’ve introduced a lot of ideas and invested a lot in terms of infrastructure in the form of building new schools and the paperless education platform that we’ve introduced. I honestly feel that our children deserve attention and if we can't give special focus to our children’s education and ensure that it is quality education, we might lose an opportunity.” He says there are mega projects being rolled out that require his attention. “I felt that if I left in the middle of all these major projects, the investment we’ve made in Gauteng might go to waste because we need to guard those investments; it’s a huge investment. Even if I can go to the NEC, it will be very difficult to monitor and support that investment. We might lose an opportunity that may benefit the entire country.” The MEC says he believes he still has time on his side to one day join the NEC but for now, his attention remains fixed on education.
