                                         CAPE TOWN - Five suspects will be appearing in court on Monday for various crimes in the Nyanga area. The group was arrested on Thursday during police operations, which have intensified ahead of the festive season. Four suspects were arrested in a house, in Crossroads, where officers found a gun, ammunition and cellphones. Officers have urged anyone who was robbed of their cellphone in Philippi Plaza to go to Nyanga Police Station to see if it might be one of the confiscated goods. Another man was arrested in the Siyahlala Informal Settlement on Thursday when he was caught stripping a car that was later found to have been reported stolen in Ottery in October. The police’s Noloyiso Rwexana said: “The five suspects will appear in the Athlone Magistrates Court on Monday for possession of a hijacked vehicle, prohibited firearm and ammunition as well as possession of stolen property.”
