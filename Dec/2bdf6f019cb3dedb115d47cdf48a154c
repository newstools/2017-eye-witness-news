                                         CAPE TOWN - AgriSA says that amending the Constitution to allow land to be expropriated without compensation would amount to no less than economic suicide.  The issue of land is one of the biggest talking points to come out of the African National Congress (ANC) commissions in Nasrec this week. The party says expropriation must first pass a sustainability test, so as not to threaten food security or undermine the economy. AgriSA’s Dan Kriek says that financial markets will undoubtedly divest in South Africa and investor confidence will be shattered. “I think the decision is very vague. Firstly, I think the ANC and its new president needs to explain to South Africa what exactly this means, how this will work and how it will be used in the same breath for economic growth and food security.” The decision was taken on Wednesday night after a furious debate in a plenary session that became so heated, it came close to collapsing the conference.
