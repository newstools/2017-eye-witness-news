                                         JOHANNESBURG - North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo says he’s received information that there’s a plot to have him and his entire family killed. Mahumapelo says that he has been told that the mastermind behind the alleged plan is a former employee from his office. The Premier’s spokesperson Brian Setswambung says: “He has expressed serious concern about this but he has said that as a leader, these are some of the things that come with leadership position. “And he says this will not deter him from continuing to do his work as a leader for the people of the province.” In October, a former African National Congress councillor accused of plotting to kill Mahumapelo was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Gaasite Legalatladi was arrested in December 2014 for consulting a traditional healer asking him to help her kill the premier.
