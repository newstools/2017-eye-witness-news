                                         JOHANNESBURG - Rhodes University's SRC says its concerned by the council's decision to set aside the renaming of the institution for a later stage. The council met last week and decided against changing the name of Rhodes despite calls by students and staff members wanting transformation. The council says financial constraints won't allow for a renaming process at this time. However, the SRC's Rolihlahla Mabaso says finances shouldn't be placed above moral obligations. “It is even of greater concern that the rhetoric of the consequences and costs of the name change remains the leading argument against the name change. This point continues to embroil us in the Cecil John Rhodes legacy that we’re trying to move away from.”
