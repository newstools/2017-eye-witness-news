                                         CAPE TOWN - The city council on Tuesday afternoon approved a drought levy. If given the go-ahead by Treasury, residents will be charged according to property value from February until 2021. The city hopes to raise almost half a billion rand in the first year of implementing the drought charge, which will fund water projects. MORE WATER RESTRICTIONS The City of Cape Town will introduce level six water restrictions in January. Mayco member for water and utilities Xanthea Limberg says this is in response to national government imposing further instructions on the province. It will mean households using more than 10,500 litres per month could face fines and penalties. In a notice published in the provincial government gazette, the city says further restrictions are necessary. The new restrictions will mean that non-residential properties will have to reduce consumption by 45%, while agricultural users will have to lower their water use by 60%. The use of borehole water for outdoor purposes is being discouraged, to preserve groundwater. Meanwhile, the council on Tuesday approved budget adjustments to fund water projects. Limberg said: “We can adjust our budget to ensure the provision of new water supply and to ensure that the Water Services Department operations are not negatively hindered.” No watering and irrigation will be allowed from municipal drinking water.
