                                         CAPE TOWN - The appointment of former Treasury Director-General Lungisa Fuzile as CEO of Standard Bank South Africa has been met with positive reaction. Fuzile left his position at the Treasury earlier this year, shortly after the sacking of former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Standard Bank group chief executive Sim Tshabalala says that he began courting Fuzile more than a year ago.  Tshabalala says that he's thrilled Fuzile accepted the role of CEO for Standard Bank's South African operations. “He also knows corporate South Africa very well, and banking is a people and relationship business. Both of those networks with customers and shareholders is important to us.” Economist Thabi Leoka says this was a great move for Standard Bank. “He understands the difficulties and challenges of the country, and what Standard Bank’s contributions should be. I think he’ll be very good at steering the ship, that is Standard Bank, into the right direction.” Treasury has also wished Fuzile well, saying that it looks forward to working with him again, albeit in a very different role.
