                                         CAPE TOWN - As the South African Revenue Service (Sars) faces a revenue shortfall of R50 billion this financial year, a fraudster has been sentenced to an effective 12 years imprisonment for VAT fraud totalling more than R15 million.  Johannes Wessels from Kraaifontein fabricated invoices from five of his businesses to claim fraudulent VAT refunds over a period of seven years.  In a plea and sentencing agreement with the state, Johannes Wessels pleaded guilty to 403 charges of fraud and 11 charges relating to contraventions of the Income Tax Act.  Sars says the VAT refunds were not based on actual transactions.  Instead, Wessels obtained unlawful refunds by creating false invoices and shifting money between his businesses.  Sars adds a significant amount of the money was spent on gambling.
