                                         MBOMBELA – Mpumalanga South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Lucky Mbuyani says delegates from the province going to the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference next weekend are the most divided the province has sent in years. He was speaking at the Elijah Mango College outside Mbombela. The was also a send-off to delegates going to the conference urging them to overlook bribes and vote in accordance with their branch mandates. Mbuyani says unity would mean voting Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa  in as ANC president, saying it has always been party tradition that a deputy replaces the then seating president. “We think the ANC must follow its traditions because those traditions have brought stability and unity in the ANC.”  A delegate at the gathering says he was asked to vote for presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and offered a mere R150. “I also received packages – R150, saying that I must not vote for that comrade Cyril Ramaphosa.(sic)” Mbuyani has announced that delegates present will be given pocket money- courtesy of the party and business society to avoid desperation from financially struggling delegates.
