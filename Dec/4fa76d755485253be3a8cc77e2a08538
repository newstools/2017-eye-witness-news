                                         JOHANNESBURG – First National Bank (FNB) says that its technicians are working to resolve a glitch to its system that’s affected some services. Users have been experiencing problems with online banking and mobile apps since Friday morning. The bank says its implemented a minimum functionality service, allowing users access to features they need. FNB’s Peter Alkema says users can still use their cards to swipe. “If you log into online, you may not be able to see the available balances of your accounts. Some payment availability is also unavailable. Cellphone banking and server capability is fully up and running. There may be intermittent delays as a result of the queues building up.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
