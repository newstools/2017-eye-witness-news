                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) NEC member Bheki Cele has called on President Jacob Zuma to use his opening address at the party’s elective conference this weekend to take some blame for the deteriorating state of the party. Cele spoke to Eyewitness News on Tuesday ahead of the gathering, where President Zuma will step down as the party’s president. He’s expected to address delegates on his political report on the first day of the conference. WATCH: I have not enjoyed last 3 years in ANC - Cele  Cele says he hopes Zuma will focus his address on the unity of the organisation, but he says there is one thing the president can’t forget. “Take some blame… which is always good for any human to say: ‘look I didn’t do good there’."  But, what does he want the president to own up to? “There are things; Nkandla is one of them and it has put us on a back foot, as well as the Constitutional Court and the Guptas. So, maybe taking some blame on those things."  He says the Zuma’s tenure recently has created confusion, factions and divisions in the party.  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
