                                         DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal was a political battleground between Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma this weekend. Both presidential candidates were in the province, where they received and addressed events.  At the rally in Clermont, President Jacob Zuma’s rape trial and his accuser, Fezekile Kuzwayo, became a political football.  ANC Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini lambasted Cyril Ramaphosa for saying he would believe the woman who came to be known as “Khwezi”. “He must talk about himself. He must respond to what was said by Ma Vivi.” But presidential nominee Dlamini Zuma chose not to comment. “I prefer not to talk about comrade Cyril Ramaphosa. He is a candidate right through this period. I’ve not been talking about other candidates and I will not start now. I have views, but I will not express them now.”   Meanwhile, Ramaphosa, who was accompanied by Senzo Mchunu, asked the Shembe church to pray that the party has a peaceful time at the elective conference.
