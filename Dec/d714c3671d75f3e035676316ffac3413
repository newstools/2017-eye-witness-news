                                         JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says if American President Donald Trump announces that he recognises Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, it will validate Israel’s historic and national identity. Netanyahu's comments come hours ahead of a much-anticipated announcement by the American president that has much of the Arab world reeling in anger. More and more countries are voicing concern over Trumps latest announcement that Washington recognises Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Meanwhile, groups of Palestinians are burning images of President Trump and the Palestinian group Hamas has called for a day of rage on Friday. Pope Francis  stresses the status quo of the city, saying that Jerusalem is unique and sacred for Jews, Christians and Muslims. While most Israelis are looking forward to the much-anticipated American president’s announcement, there are concerns violence could break out and Israeli security is being beefed up. Palestinians are afraid that such a statement from Washington would deter their hopes that one day east Jerusalem would be the capital of a future Palestinian state.
