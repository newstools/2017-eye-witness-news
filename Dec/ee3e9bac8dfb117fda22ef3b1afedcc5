                                         CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has reiterated community members are not obligated to pay bonuses or so-called Christmas boxes to Solid Waste staff members. Residents are, however, free to give council workers a voluntary donation. Officials have warned residents should also be aware of scam artists posing as Solid Waste Management staff over the festive season in order to score a quick buck. The city’s Xanthea Limberg said: The policy prohibits staff from asking for Christmas boxes. Staff are appropriately remunerated and should not, under any circumstances, be asking residents for donations.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
