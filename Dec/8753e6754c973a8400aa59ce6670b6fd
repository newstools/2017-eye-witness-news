The bus, filled with passengers, was destined for the Eastern Cape.

Africa says officials were immediately deployed to the station for a thorough investigation. “We brought our two testing units and we did tests and we found that there was problems with the braking system of the bus, there was problem with the steering wheel. Some of the seats were loosened and there also cockroaches on the bus.”
