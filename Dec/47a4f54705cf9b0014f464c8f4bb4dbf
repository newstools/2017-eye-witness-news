Chiba suffered a heart attack a few days ago and was hospitalized before being discharged this week. JOHANNESBURG - As condolences continue to pour in following the death of struggle icon Laloo Chiba, the Nelson Mandela Foundation has described him as a person of a great integrity. Chiba who was imprisoned in Robben Island for 18 years died yesterday morning at the age of 87. He suffered a heart attack a few days ago and was hospitalised, before being discharged this week. The foundation says late former president Nelson Mandela in his book, wrote of Chiba as “a member of the MK high command and a stalwart colleague who proved a great asset in prison.” The foundation’s Verne Harris said, “He believed in core values that he applied. He had a proud record of service post-1994 in Parliament. He felt very deeply about the challenges we are currently going through as a country.”
