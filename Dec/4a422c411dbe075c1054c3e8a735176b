                                         JOHANNESBURG - The sister of a woman murdered at her Brackenhurst home  in Alberton says she’ relieved that her alleged killer has been denied bail. Enzo Pietropaolo abandoned his bail application in the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court on Friday, shortly after hearing that his three sons and his sister-in-law submitted statements to police giving reasons why he should remain in custody. Manuela Pietropaolo was in the process of divorcing her husband when she was shot multiple times last month. Serena Nicolaides has told Eyewitness News she’s afraid of the accused and even considered moving her 90-year-old mother to a place of safety in the event that Pietropaolo was granted bail. “We wouldn't have been happy if he was going to get bail. We were left fearing in case he comes back to us. We don’t know what he would’ve done.” After court proceedings, some family members stayed behind in the public gallery to face the accused. An emotional Nicolaides says Pietropaolo had a “blank expression” on his face. “No remorse, whatsoever.” The case has been postponed for three months while investigations continue.
