                                         JOHANNESBURG - While the outcomes of four provincial African National Congress (ANC) conferences are being disputed in court, Secretary General Gwede Mantashe  says he's certain there will be no legal battles following the elective conference in two weeks’ time. Matashe was speaking at Luthuli House on Monday afternoon following the party's last NEC meeting for the year. He says he has given all branches until Saturday to re-run their general meetings if necessary. Four of the nine provincial general council outcomes have already been disputed, but Mantashe says he does not foresee any court battles around the elective conference. “I can tell when we’re finished with the conference, nobody will be interested in going to court.” He says there’s a concern about taking disputes to the courts, adding that the internal processes should be trusted. “What people don’t appreciate is that the many of those court cases don’t succeed because they’re not well thought through, people do it emotionally and because they think they want to spite the ANC.” Mantashe says the party is ready for the national conference but wouldn’t say exactly how many disputes still need to be resolved.
