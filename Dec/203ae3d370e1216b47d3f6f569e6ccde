                                         JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Pretoria has found that the taxpayer shouldn’t be burdened with costs for President Jacob Zuma's conduct and ordered he personally pay the costs of his failed attempt to block the release of the state capture report. Zuma had launched the application on the eve of the release of the report last year on grounds that he wasn’t given an opportunity to respond to the allegations against him. When the application was ready to be heard, he withdrew it. Judge President Dunstan Mlambo handed down judgment on Wednesday morning. “My view is that in this case, a simple punitive costs order is not appropriate. I say this because that would make the taxpayer liable for the costs. This is a case where this court would be justified to find that this is an unwarranted instance for the taxpayer to carry that burden. The conduct of the president and the context of the litigation he initiated requires a sterner rebuke.” Mlambo says the president’s conduct amounts to an attempt to stymie the work of the Public Protector. “The background of the matter and the circumstances of the litigation show the president had no acceptable basis in law to have persisted with this investigation. In fact, the president’s conduct amounts to an attempt to stymie the fulfilment of a constitutional obligation by the office of the Public Protector.” Later on Wednesday afternoon, the court is expected to rule on whether Zuma is legally compelled by the Chapter 9 office to set up an official inquiry into state capture.
