It's been revealed that Tegeta threatened to cut supply to the power station because it wants Eskom to increase the amount it pays for coal. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it has at least a 10-day coal supply at its Hendrina power station in Mpumalanga, but the assessment continues. In an amaBhungane exclusive last week, it was revealed that Gupta-owned Tegeta threatened to cut supply to the power station because it wants Eskom to increase the amount it pays for coal. Leaked minutes of an Eskom meeting revealed that managers were warned that the power station could be forced to shut down, alternatively, they'd have to use expensive open cycle gas turbines or contend with load shedding. If Eskom has a coal stockpile of less than 20 days, then there could be complications and the utility has threatened to take legal action. Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe says load shedding is not a risk at this stage and they’re still receiving supply from Tegeta. “We continue to engage Tegeta. Our teams have indicated that there’s 10 days of coal supply, but we’ll continue with our assessment; the counting continues.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
