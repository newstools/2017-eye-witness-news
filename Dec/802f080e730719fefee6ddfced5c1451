                                         JOHANNESBURG - Questions continue to swirl around the appointment of Dudu Myeni as special advisor to the transport minister.  The Sunday Times reported that Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi confirmed Myeni’s appointment, describing her as "highly recommended". The newspaper also reported that South African Airways may be moved from the National Treasury to the Transport Department.  The Democratic Alliance (DA) says that if the airlines move, Myeni will meddle in SAA affairs despite laws restricting her from doing so.   The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse’s Wayne Duvenage says he is concerned about Myeni’s appointment. “It’s his choice. But if he is taking her as his advisor on the basis that she has aviation experience, well that is really the problem. She has no real aviation experience other than chairing the SAA board.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
