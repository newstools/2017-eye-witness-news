                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy Police Minister Bongani Mkongi has on Friday visited the family of a Gugulethu woman allegedly murdered by her boyfriend. The visit comes as government marks the annual 16 days of activism against gender violence campaign. Unathi Sabsana was shot dead, allegedly by her partner in new crossroads last Sunday. The police ministry's Siyabulela Tom said: “What sparked the visit today is the fact that on Sunday a young lady was murdered by her boyfriend in that area. He shot her in front of her parents.” Tom says Mkongi also went to pay his respects to the family of Phumza Pita, who was allegedly shot dead by a police officer in March. “My understanding is that a quarrel had ensued between a group of members of the community then the police attempted to perhaps stop what was some activity that was happening in the street. And so there was that quarrel that ensued and then it led to the shooting.”
