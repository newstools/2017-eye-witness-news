                                         JOHANNESBURG - Emotional scenes are playing out at the Esidimeni arbitration hearings  where families of the victims and retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke have broken down in tears during an apology by Dr Barney Selebano.  Selebano, who is the Gauteng Health Department’s suspended HOD, has been testifying since Tuesday on the role he played in the transfer of patients from Esidimeni facilities to ill-equipped NGOs. At least 143 patients died in the wake of the rushed moves. Selebano says he takes accountability for the disastrous project. “I am saying to the families, you have every right to not forgive us. You have every right to look at us angrily and say you’ve lost your loved ones. That is why I kept on saying you can’t explain this. In short, we made a mess … we made a mess.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
