                                         CAPE TOWN – A fire safety pilot project has been launched in Joe Slovo Park near Milnerton. The initiative will see some more than a thousand homes painted with fire retardant paint. Smoke detectors will also be installed. The City of Cape Town's Suzette Little said: “Because there are such a lot of fires, this is me just trying to find a way to resolve the fires and trying not to have so much loss. But what we have noticed in that area specifically is that the houses are very very close to one other. It’s very dense in that area.”
