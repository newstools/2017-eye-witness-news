                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Metsimaholo Municipality is still in limbo following recent by-elections. The municipality will either have to go into an election rerun or a coalition will have to be formed.  No party that contested the polls secured an outright majority. In a first, the South African Communist Party (SACP) went up against its alliance partner the African National Congress in the election. SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande says that he's impressed by the party's performance. “We achieved this result in the face of considerable destabilisation efforts and threats from Ace Magashule and his corporate captured Free State ANC faction.” LISTEN: SACP had no time to prove it can govern properly – analyst  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
