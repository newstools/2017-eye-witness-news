                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Gwede Mantashe says there are plans in place to deal with issues currently faced by various provinces as the organisation heads to its national elective conference. About Mpumalanga, Mantashe says the so-called vote for unity in that province will not make it to the conference. “There will be no unity on the ballot paper… those are nominations. Now, we’re heading to the conference, we’ll have elections. On the ballot paper, there will be names of the nominated candidates.” Mantashe says there’s an internal party process tackling the issues in the Eastern Cape, where there was violence during the provincial elective conference earlier this year. “We told them it’s urgent and urged that they don’t do a half-cooked job. They must gather evidence that will be presented at the NEC.” He says members of the Free State should do political work and desist from being emotional about the removal of Ace Magashule who was re-elected as provincial chair on Monday night. “If people were contesting the election in the Free State, they become emotional and not do solid political work… they’ll not remove Magashule from that position (sic).”
