Delegates started voting on Sunday night in a closely fought contest between presidential contenders Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. Some were expected only to cast their ballots on Monday morning, with the outcome only expected to be announced later today. Zweli Mkhize, as the treasurer-general, is expected to address the Progressive Business Forum breakfast this morning as he has done every morning so far. On Sunday, he said that he may not be here but his successor has not yet been announced. By Tuesday, business leaders will be addressed by either Paul Mashatile or Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. At the, same time Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu is due to deliver a key note address this morning. Throughout the conference, the business community has been assured that the incoming leadership will focus on economic growth and policy implementation.
