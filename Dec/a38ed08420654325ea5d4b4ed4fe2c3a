                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) has elected Narius Moloto as the party’s new president at its two-day national conference in Mpumalanga. Moloto who was the party’s secretary general is filling the post after it was vacant, following the expulsion of Luthando Mbinda for bringing the organisation into disrepute. He says the leadership will focus mainly on building the PAC and defending its policies. “I am honoured and humbled by this appointment. It’s a very huge responsibility that was started by Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, the first president, therefore it is a very difficult and challenging responsibility but I accept this challenge and will try my best to help take the PAC to new heights.”
