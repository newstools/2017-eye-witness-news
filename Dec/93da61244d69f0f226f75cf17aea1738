                                         JOHANNESBURG – Scores of African National Congress (ANC) supporters in Emdeni south in Soweto are awaiting the arrival of treasurer general Zweli Mkhize, who is expected to address them. Earlier on Sunday, Mkhize conducted a door to door campaign ahead of ward 11’s bi-elections in February next year.  Hundreds of people have filled the hall here at the Emdeni Junior Secondary School. Women dressed in the party’s woman’s league regalia are also here in their numbers. As the national elective conference draws closer, presidential hopeful Mkhize could use this platform to continue with his campaign for the ANC’S highest office. The ANC treasurer general is expected to arrive shortly. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
