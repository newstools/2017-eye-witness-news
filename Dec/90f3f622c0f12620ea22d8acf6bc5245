                                         JOHANNESBURG - Six women have filed a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, claiming that the movie mogul's actions to cover up assaults amount to civil racketeering. The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in a Federal Court in New York seeking to represent a class of “dozens, if not hundreds” of women who say they were assaulted by Weinstein. The fresh legal action comes just hours after Time magazine named “The Silence Breakers” its Person of The Year. The group refers to people, mainly women, who’ve come forward and spoken out about sexual harassment and assault.
