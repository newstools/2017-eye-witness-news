                                         CAPE TOWN - South Africans' trust in politicians is on the decline. More than half of citizens of voting age surveyed for the latest reconciliation barometer said voting is meaningless because politicians can't be trusted. A quarter of those polled by the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation say they don't feel close to any political party. Young people, in particular, are fed up with politicians. Only 33% of South Africans say they have a great deal of confidence in the African National Congress. While 23% have expressed confidence in the Democratic Alliance and 19% in the Economic Freedom Fighters. The institute says these figures are telling ahead of the 2019 elections. The institute's Gugu Nonjinge said: “Over the past 10 years, there’s been a significant erosion of confidence in key public institutions amongst young people. This is why South Africa has been seeing young people mobilising themselves outside of these key institutions and forming social movements.” She says even without evidence to support their view; many believe corruption is even taking place in their communities.
