                                         PRETORIA - The High Court in Pretoria has criticised President Jacob Zuma for abusing court processe s through successive litigation. The findings were in the judgment which set aside the resignation and appointment of advocates Mxolisi Nxasana  and Shaun Abrahams respectively as prosecutions boss. The court has given the deputy president 60 days to appoint a new national director but Zuma has already announced he will appeal the ruling. The court referred to the president’s broader conduct in litigation where he defends the indefensible until conceding in the end that there is no case. The full bench held that Zuma does this in order to take advantage any passage of time may bring. The court says this strategy played out in the Nkandla and spytapes matters. The judges also rejected the president’s claims that Nxasana asked that he vacate his office which is a requirement in terms of law for the national director to resign. They found that Zuma persuaded Nxasana to leave by offering him an unlawful payment of money. (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
