                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to Energy Minister David Mahlobo asking him to withhold the R2.1 million "once-off gratuity" to former minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson. The party believes it'll be wrong to give her the money until the conclusion of a probe into the sale of 10 million barrels of crude oil from the country's strategic reserves which took place under her watch. The oil stocks were sold below market value. DA Member of Parliament (MP) Gavin Davis says it's unclear why she is getting the payment at all. “The money comes from the Department of Energy and what is particularly galling about it is that the money comes from a renewable energy project, a national solar water heater project.  "So essentially, money is being taken from a project to deliver renewable energy and being given to the minister. And that really does thicken the crow.” Joemat-Pettersson lost her job as Cabinet minister earlier this year and then resigned as MP.
