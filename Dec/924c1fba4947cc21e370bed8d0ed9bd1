                                         CAPE TOWN - Eyewitness News understands the Social Security Agency (Sassa) has filed its plan for the takeover of grant payments to the Constitutional Court. But it remains unclear what deal has been reached with the Post Office after weeks of deadlock. Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, who took over the reins in November to expedite negotiations, is expected to make an announcement on Sunday. Sassa was given a deadline of Friday to provide the Constitutional Court with its plan for the takeover of social grants. The Inter-Ministerial Committee led by Radebe had to step in in November after negotiations with the Post Office stalled. Sassa is already months behind in implementing a new grant payments system that will see the end of its invalid contract with Cash Paymaster Services. The Constitutional Court ordered in November that Sassa provide it, on Friday, with exact responsibilities and precise timelines for a new implementation plan. The agency is also expected to have filed a contingency plan if it can’t meet the 1 April deadline. Radebe’s office says given the sensitivity of the issue, it won’t be commenting until Sunday.
