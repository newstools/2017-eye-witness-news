                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) says it hopes for a healthy relationship between journalists and the newly elected African National Congress (ANC) leadership.  Chairperson Mahlatse Mahlase says: “There will always be a healthy tension between the media and those that hold power because our role is very different but we appreciate the fact that he has acknowledged our role, guaranteed by the Constitution.” The editors’ forum's comment comes after a video of security officials manhandling Bloomberg journalist Sam Mkokeli at the ANC conference.   Mkokeli, who gave up his accreditation to avoid having it forcibly removed, was evicted from the venue and only had the accreditation returned hours later.
