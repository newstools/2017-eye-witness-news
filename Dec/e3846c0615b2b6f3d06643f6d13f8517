                                         JOHANNESBURG - Bidvest Wits  were crowned Telkom Knock-Out champions on Saturday night after beating Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 at the Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban. The Premier Soccer League (PSL) defending champions haven’t had a great season in the league so far, as they are still rooted to the bottom of the log with nine points and only two victories in 11 games. The match looked like it was heading for extra time and the dreaded penalty shoot-out before Vincent Pule’s stoppage-time goal sealed the title for the "Clever Boys". Both teams created chances but could not convert any of them before Pule’s late strike. Interestingly, the title added another milestone for Bidvest Wits’ coach Gavin Hunt, who joins Pitso Mosimane  as the only two coaches to win all domestic titles on offer, since the inception of the PSL era. Hunt says that he is happy with the performance of his team. “All in all, I’m happy with the performance, once again I say that if we have all our players available we are a different team, and defensively we were good tonight.” Wits will now have to focus on their league form, with their next assignment being a home clash against Ajax Cape Town on Wednesday.
