Paramedics say rescue services had to use the jaws-of-life to free the deceased from the vehicles on Saturday. The three patients were all declared dead at the scene while all the injured have been transported to the nearby hospitals.  ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring says: “On closer inspection paramedics discovered the bodies of a woman and two-year-old boy lying trapped in one of the vehicles. The body of a man was found trapped inside the second vehicle. Unfortunately, all three patients had succumbed to their multiple fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for them, and they were declared dead.” The cause of the crash is not yet known. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
