                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa says the party's top six represents a united leadership, combining different views. Ramaphosa was speaking during his first walkabout as the party’s president accompanied by newly elected treasurer-general Paul Mashatile. Cyril Ramaphosa's preferred slate included Lindiwe Sisulu and Senzo Mchunu, who both did not make it onto the top six. However, Ramaphosa says the voting delegates chose their own slate. “The membership has decided to give, if you like, their own slate, their own leadership as the top six. And we believe that with the national executive committee the same will prevail.” He says this new leadership is one that shows a united ANC. “Leadership that has been chosen is a unity leadership. It’s a leadership that combines the different views and approaches that were prevalent in the conference prior to the election. And we are very pleased with that.” He says those who predicted that the conference would collapse have been proven wrong. Ramaphosa says he wants the governing party to emerge from the elective conference stronger and renewed. For now, delegates have made their way back into the plenary as voting for the NEC is underway.
