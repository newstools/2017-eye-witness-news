                                         JOHANNESBURG - Earlier on Saturday morning ANC Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize has reassured the Progressive Business Forum of the party's commitment to taking the country forward while emphasising the need to broaden the economy to include the marginalised sections of the population. Relations between the governing party and business have become increasingly strained over the last few years with debate around land redistribution and radical economic transformation and corruption dominating national discourse. The country's credit downgrades have also caused further tension between the two sides. Mkhize says the eyes of the world will undoubtedly be focused on South Africa.  The treasurer general has assured business leaders that important policy issues will be prioritised as soon as a new leader is elected. Mkhize says the ANC has heard the concerns from business leaders in the country. He says this elective conference is not just about voting in a new ANC leader.
