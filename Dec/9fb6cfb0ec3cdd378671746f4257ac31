                                         JOHANNESBURG - A City of Johannesburg official employed as a bookkeeper in the Housing Department has been suspended for fraud. The official allegedly inflated quotations submitted by service providers so the department would not consider their proposals. The employee would then award work to companies which had links to her so she could benefit. The city says a case was opened with the police on Wednesday. Spokesperson Lucky Sindane said: “The matter was brought to us in June this year after a company suspected there were fraudulent activities and inconsistencies with the quotation that they were supposed to pay.”
