                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Services (Sars) says that it will start collecting sugar tax from April next year. Parliament passed the bill earlier this month and it now requires commercial manufacturers that produce sugary drinks with a cumulative sugar content of more than 500kg annually to register and pay the levy. While non-commercial producers need to register, they will not be required to pay the tax. The revenue service's Sandile Memela says registrations will begin in February. “Sars will engage industry stakeholders during roadshows to guide them through a process in January and February next year. And the details of this will be published on our website in January.”
