                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) has hit out at Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa for what it calls “his direct attack on a sitting president”. During a 702 Town Hall broadcast on Thursday night, Ramaphosa said he “would have believed” Zuma’s rape accuser. He was referring to Fezekile Kuzwayo, who accused President Jacob Zuma of rape more than a decade ago and the then deputy president was later acquitted. Kuzwayo and her family later went into exile after alleged threats and intimidation; she died recently. Asked if he believes Kuzwayo was raped, Ramaphosa said: “I know how difficult and painful it is for a woman to gunner up the courage to stand up and say ‘yes, I was raped’. It must be one of the most difficult decisions that she has to make. So, yes I would believe her." The ANCYL says Ramaphosa’s statement is an act of desperation that proves his conscious has left him. It’s called on him to publicly respond to what it calls “this fellows recklessness” or face the ANC rulebook. LISTEN: Ramaphosa says he believes Khwezi was raped
