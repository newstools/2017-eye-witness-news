                                         CAPE TOWN - It's not only pets who will have to be kept cool by owners but farm animals as the South African Weather Service warns of extremely hot weather in most parts of the Western Cape on Friday. This week temperatures have soared up to 41 degrees in certain areas.  Robertson veterinarian Erika van Zyl has urged pet owners to keep their animals inside and frequently check their water bowls. Van Zyl says she's had to treat many animals who've suffered from heat stroke this week. “I’ve seen a few cases now, I have just treated a sheep with heat stroke. People must just keep their pets inside, in a cool area. For farm animals, let them have shelter where there’s shade. Give the animals fresh and clean water.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
