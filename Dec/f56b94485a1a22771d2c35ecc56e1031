                                         JOHANNESBURG - Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa has dodged a question on whether he is willing to serve as deputy president to Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma if he loses at the party’s elective conference next week. Ramaphosa was speaking during the 702 Town Hall on the Karima Brown Show on Thursday night. President Jacob Zuma has previously proposed that whoever loses as president be accommodated as deputy president.  Ramaphosa says he still needs to reflect on whether he wants to be deployed in the same position if he wins. "Right now, the talent that I have has been utilised effectively as deputy president and membership is saying 'we want you now to be deployed elsewhere.'" But what if branches want him to still serve the party if he loses? “If I have lost, they will say 'we want you to be deployed elsewhere' and I will accept that.” He has clarified, though, that he is willing accept the outcome of the conference and rally behind whoever wins next week.
