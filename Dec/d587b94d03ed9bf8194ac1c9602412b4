                                         CAPE TOWN - The SA Revenue Service (Sars) has moved to counter reports that itâ€™s bleeding staff. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Sars says the number of resignations has, in fact, declined dramatically over the past four years. Its head of human capital Teboho Mokoena says the figures show the service is retaining critical and scarce skills. This is contrary to reports that senior staff have been leaving the organisation in droves since the appointment of Tom Moyane as Sars commissioner in 2014. Sars has also been in the spotlight since it was revealed that it would be suffering R50 billion revenue shortfall this financial year. In a response to a Parliamentary question earlier in December, Sars has revealed more than 500 people left its employ in the first 10 months of the year, including those who retired. But Mokoena says its figures show a 40% decline in the number of resignations since 2013. From 645 resignations in 2013/14 to 391 resignations in 2016/17, Mokoena says the figures indicate the organisation is retaining staff in general, including in areas of critical skills. Mokoena says the 4% attrition rate at Sars is good when compared to organisations of similar size and complexity where the average is 10%. He says the academic qualifications of Sars staff remain high and that its 14,000 staff members are highly skilled, educated and committed to meeting its revenue collection mandate.
