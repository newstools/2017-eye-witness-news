                                         HARARE - Zimbabwe’s new Cabinet ministers have taken their oaths of office at a ceremony at State House in Harare. The ministers were sworn in by the new president Emmerson Mnangagwa on Monday. Standing before President Mnangagwa, the ministers held up Bibles and pledged to remain faithful to Zimbabwe and to observe its laws. Many of the ministers who took the oath of office have served in previous government positions under former president Robert Mugabe. That, critics say, makes the current line-up uninspiring; they say it doesn’t reflect the unity seen in the country in the days before Mugabe’s resignation. There has also been criticism over the lack of gender balance, as only four of the 21 new Cabinet ministers are women.
