                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department is dealing with yet another protest at a school following the appointment of a black principal.  Parents at Noordgesig Primary School in Soweto disrupted learning on Friday, saying that the appointment was imposed on them.  The department maintains it received approval from the school governing body and has labelled the protests as racist. Spokesperson Steve Mabona says: “Why do you question the race instead of looking at the credentials, look at the qualifications thereof, or anything that suggests that process wasn’t followed thereof.  “But you sense that the issue here is whether this person is black and is not a coloured.” The department will be meeting the concerned parents on Monday morning.
