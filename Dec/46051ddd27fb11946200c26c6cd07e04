                                         PRETORIA - One of the biggest tests of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office will get underway on Tuesday in the High Court in Pretoria where Absa, Treasury and the South African Reserve Bank will challenge her controversial report into the so-called Bankorp lifeboat.  Mkhwebane’s report, released in June, ordered that Absa pay back more than R1 billion it allegedly unlawfully received as a bail-out during apartheid from the reserve bank.  She also ordered that the Reserve Bank’s constitutional mandate be changed but this remedial action has already been set aside by the court.  Not only do the applicants want Mkhwebane to personally pay the costs of this application, they want the court to declare that she has abused her office.  Absa, Treasury and the reserve bank have questioned the advocate about a meeting she had with the Presidency where they allege she discussed proposed amendments to the Constitution related to the central bank’s mandate.  Mkhwebane has not adequately addressed these in her answering affidavit.  She has been accused of abusing the court's process and breaking every rule applicable to organs of State in review proceedings.  The matter has been set down for three days. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
