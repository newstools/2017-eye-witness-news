                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department  says it is concerned about having to deal with another school having rejected a principal on the basis of race. Parents at Noordgesig Primary School have rejected the appointment of a new principal, saying they feel the decision was imposed on them. A new headmaster was supposed to start his first day as principal of the Soweto school after his predecessor was fired two years ago amid a circumcision scandal. However, learning was disrupted when some members of the community protested. In a statement, they refer to the new headmaster as a "Bantu African" but claim they are not rejecting him based on race. The departments Steve Mabona says the statement by the concerned group shows racial intolerance. “If you read on what they’ve penned. They’re talking about a Nguni African, Bantu. They are going back to apartheid years where you utilize Bantu. But then they will be quick in saying they are not racist.” The department will be meeting the concerned parent’s on Monday morning.
