                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance has hit back at South African Revenue Services (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane over a financial intelligence report regarding suspicious payments of almost R1 million  to one of its top officials, Jonas Makwakwa. Committee chairperson Yunus Carrim says the report is already in the public domain, and the committee has nothing to do with the leaks. In a strongly worded letter to the committee, Moyane suggests that Members of Parliament (MPs) may have fallen foul of the law by being in possession of the document, and says he has to report the matter to the Financial Intelligence Centre. In a letter to the committee, Moyane wants to know where on the internet the committee's legal advisor found the report on Makwakwa that was circulated to MPs. Carrim says it's inconceivable that a Sars official could not find the report online after it was posted by the Daily Maverick, and that it was not Parliament's job to provide Sars with the details. Carrim adds the committee never asked to discuss the report at its meeting last week as Moyane claims, but rather requested copies of three other reports related to the matter. He says the issue over the leaked report must be handled by Sars and the Financial Intelligence Centre.
