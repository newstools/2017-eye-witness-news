                                         JOHANNESBURG - Amid uncertainty on university fee increases for 2018, community activist John Molepo says he will continue with his #ThusaNgwanaGeno  campaign throughout December to ensure that underprivileged students receive funding for university registration next year. Molepo, who is a PhD student at the Tshwane University of Technology, is the leader of a group of graduates who ask for donations from motorists at the city’s traffic lights, wearing graduation regalia. Molepo says he has managed to pay for the registration fees of seven students in the 2017 academic year and is now aiming for 50 in 2018. “We have witnessed the students going home because of a lack of funds. Some of them currently are smoking nyaope. Some of them are busy doing bad things out there because of they did not get an opportunity to go to university because of lack of funds. So, we decided that let us come up with this initiative to ensure that no one goes home because of lack of funds.” President Jacob Zuma released the Heher Commission Report  last month, which found that free tertiary education for all is not feasible. Universities, however, are yet to announce their increases.
