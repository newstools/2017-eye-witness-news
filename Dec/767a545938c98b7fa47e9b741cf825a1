                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC)'s stalwarts have made renewed calls for President Jacob Zuma to be recalled, calling on the new national executive committee (NEC) to act fast. The stalwarts have previously blamed the president for what they call the deteriorating state of the party. In a statement, the veterans say the ANC must start a process of cleaning itself. Stalwart Murphy Morobe says that process should start with the recall of the president. “The new president [Cyril] Ramaphosa will find that at the top of his entrée will be this as one of the matters he has to look at. I think it is a logical thing. And in an interview, I once saw with president Zuma himself talking about two centres of power, he was quite clear that having two centres can be disruptive to the attainment of the organisation.”
