                                         CAPE TOWN - Human rights organisation, Amnesty International, has called for an investigation into police conduct in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A number of protests took place in cities across the country calling for President Joseph Kabila to step down. The organisation says one man has been shot dead by police in the town of Butembo while dozens more have been injured. Kabila, whose been in power since 2001, was supposed to step down at the end of his second term in December last year. His office has, however, said he would remain in power until a new leader is elected, following elections that will only be held in December 2018. Amnesty International's DRC researcher Jean-Mobert Senga said: “We are very concerned…people from the opposition and civil society can’t speak, express themselves and demonstrate peacefully. Only those who support president Kabila are allowed to demonstrate and to speak freely.”
