                                         PRETORIA - The High Court in Pretoria has found that the Public Protector does have the powers to instruct the president to exercise executive authority.  Judge President Dunstan Mlambo is handing down judgment on Wednesday in President Jacob Zuma's application to review and set aside former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report. Zuma had objected to the instruction that the commission be led by a judge selected by the chief justice, arguing that as president only he has the power to make such decisions. Mlambo says the president sought that the matter be referred back to the Public Protector for further investigation because the Public Protector canâ€™t outsource functions - but in argument, he abandoned that remittal. Earlier on Wednesday morning, Mlambo ordered Zuma to personally pay the costs of his failed attempt to stop the release of State of Capture report.
