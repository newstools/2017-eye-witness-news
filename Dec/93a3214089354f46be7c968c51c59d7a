                                         CAPE TOWN - Workers at the Vergelen Wine Estate have cleared over 2,000 hectares of alien vegetation  as part of ongoing efforts to curb wildfires. The Somerset West estate is hosting the launch of the wildfire season. This will see increased resources being pumped into firefighting efforts.  Estate managing director, Don Tooth, said: “I think the big impact we saw in terms of fire was obviously one of fires in ’97 and that stage we fought it for 21 days. There was a lot of standing alien vegetation in place, the majority of it is now cleared. This last fire that went through at the beginning of last year lasted three and a half days.”
