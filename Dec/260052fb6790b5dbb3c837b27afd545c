                                         CAPE TOWN - The new police commissioner says he’s opting for a quick win approach to crime fighting. Khehla Sitole is appearing before Parliament’s police committee on Friday morning where the SAPS is answering questions on issues related to crime intelligence.  Sitole says he'll be announcing a new deputy commissioner for detective services this afternoon.  The top cop says he’s already working on a turnaround strategy for the police service. But for now, he’s going for quick wins. “I have realised there are various situations happening in the country which tend to demonstrate that policing does not exist.” Sithole says Operation Fiela, a multidisciplinary approach to sweep criminal activities off the street, has to be revived immediately. “There’s too much activity in the underworld and some by syndicates.” He says fixing the problems within crime intelligence is top of his agenda, and a turnaround strategy for this division will be ready next week.
