It is understood that the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal is yet to make a decision. Steinhoff started to lose credit lines from lenders and is still unable to determine the scale of accounting irregularities. Over the past two weeks, Steinhoff has lost 10 billion dollars in market value since its alleged fraudulent activities came to light.
