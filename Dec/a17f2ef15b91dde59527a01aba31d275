                                         JOHANNESBURG- Blitzbok speedster Seabelo Senatla will focus on 15-man rugby with the Stormers next year, but still harbors dreams of participating in the Sevens World Cup. Senatla and the Blitzboks came third in the recently concluded Cape Town leg of the World Sevens Series, a tournament in which Senatla scored his 200th try in just his 35th tournament, the fastest by any player.  Senatla will join the Stormers after the tournaments in Sydney and Hamilton next year. However, it’s a huge year for the Blitzboks with the World Cup in June and before that the Commonwealth Games, events that Senatla is very keen on taking part in.  “I didn’t do well in the last Sevens World Cup and I would like to rectify that, but I know that my focus now is on 15’s.”  Senatla says that he hopes that a deal will be made for him to be able to participate in both the Sevens World Cup and the Commonwealth Games.  “Hopefully the coaches will make a plan to get me to play in the Commonwealth Games and the World Cup, but of course 15’s will take up the bulk of my focus now.”
