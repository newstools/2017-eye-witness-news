                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State will know on Friday if its delegates will be attending the party’s national elective conference. Dissident members filed an application to interdict the province from sending delegates to the conference which starts on Saturday. The Bloemfontein High Court previously ruled that 29 branches in four regions of the Free State were in breach the ANC’s constitution and ordered that they rerun their branch general meetings before the provincial party could hold its elective conference.  The provincial party, however, did hold its conference this week and reelected Ace Magashule as ANC chairperson uncontested. It claimed that it complied with the court order by making sure the 29 branches hold their meetings again and in accordance with the constitution. If the court finds that the provincial party defied its instruction, the outcome of its elective conference may be rendered null and void, meaning the province’s 27 leaders may be barred from attending the conference together with the delegates from the 29 branches in question.
