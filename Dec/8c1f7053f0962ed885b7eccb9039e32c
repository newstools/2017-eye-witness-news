                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Basic Education Department says it’s shocked and angered by a controversial image used on a matric invitation at Selborne College in East London. The artwork is an image of the historic 1976 uprising photograph of Hector Pieterson.  In it, Pieterson’s body has been replaced with the school's blazer and his face with the image of a dog.  The picture has caused widespread anger on social media. The department’s spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says the portrait is tasteless and insensitive. “Yes people will say it’s freedom of expression but at what cost because there were people who are affected by that situation and this picture is not reflecting correctly the events as they happen.”
