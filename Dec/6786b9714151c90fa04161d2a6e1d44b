                                         MBOMBELA - African National Congress (ANC)  Mpumalanga Chairperson David Mabuza has called for thorough talks to elect a credible and a united leadership at the party's elective conference. Consolidated votes show that hundreds of candidates chose to abstain from voting, writing the word ‘unity’ on their ballot sheets. The province held its general council in Mbombela earlier on Friday. The day began with songs of unity as a message. And then the opening address delivered by National Chair Baleka Mbete who said: “I will miss being called national person but 10 years is enough.” At the end of the day, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma emerged with a narrow margin ahead of her rival Cyril Ramaphosa. However, Mabuza says electing Dlamini Zuma as president would be backing a factional candidate.
