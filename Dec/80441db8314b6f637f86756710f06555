                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee member Barbara Hogan  says she believes Cyril Ramaphosa will be able to unite the party should he emerge victorious and become the ANC's new president. Hogan is attending the conference at Nasrec as a non-voting delegate. She says between Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Ramaphosa, she believes Ramaphosa will fare better in bringing the party together. “I must say my preference is for Cyril Ramaphosa. He has always been in his history an incredible, smart negotiator. Hogan has rejected suggestions by President Jacob Zuma last week that an open letter by her late husband Ahmed Kathrada addressed to the outgoing ANC leader was fake. Zuma made the remarks during an interview on the SABC last week. “I can show you the computers he was working on. He spent months crafting this letter because it was one of the most painful things he had ever felt he ought to do.” Hogan has described Zuma’s remarks as shocking. Meanwhile Dlamini Zuma's campaigner Carl Niehaus  says he's convinced she’ll be the next president. “We respect delegates and I don’t believe, contrary to what many people are saying that our delegates will allow themselves to be bought or will allow themselves to be persuaded differently. Delegates come here with mandates from branches, and we expect from them to carry out those mandates.”
