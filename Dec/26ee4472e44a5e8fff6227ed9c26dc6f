                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says the only way members of the nullified KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial executive will be allowed to vote at the conference is if they've been sent as branch delegates. Earlier on Friday, the Pietermaritzburg High Court granted the KZN PEC  leave to appeal against the September ruling which declared the 2015 provincial elective conference unlawful. At the same time, the court also granted an execution order ruling that the KZN executive must immediately vacate office. During the final state of readiness briefing, Mantashe said the 27 KZN executive members will be allowed into the conference but won’t be able to vote unless they are sent as branch delegates. “Delegates to the national conference which were in a different process we don’t think can be impacted by the judgment. Banning any ANC members from participating in other activities is actually judicial overreach.” Friday’s ruling in the Pietermaritzburg High Court means KZN executive members must leave the provincial offices pending the outcome of their appeal process in the Supreme Court of Appeal. It is, however, unclear if secretary Super Zuma  will be replaced during the credentials process at the conference. The KZN ANC says the NEC is likely to make a final determination on this question. Earlier on Friday in the North West, the High Court set aside the Bojanala regional conference and the majority of branch general meetings. Meanwhile, in the Free State, the Bloemfontein High Court is expected to deliver its ruling on whether the provincial party's more than 400 delegates can attend the conference.
