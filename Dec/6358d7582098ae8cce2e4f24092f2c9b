                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has struck a deal with the Post Office. Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe made the announcement at a briefing in Pretoria. Radebe says grants will be issued through a channel of the beneficiaries' choice including commercial banks, Postbank and other legally registered informal traders like spaza shops.  Sassa was due to meet a deadline on Friday to provide the Constitutional Court with a takeover plan as its contract with cash paymaster services drew to an end.
