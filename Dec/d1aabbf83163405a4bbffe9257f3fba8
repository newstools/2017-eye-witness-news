                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) is considering a number of changes when it comes to Parliament. The ANC’s Obed Bapela gave a briefing on policy discussions around governance and the legislatures earlier on Tuesday evening. The ANC wants to investigate creating the position of a Speaker of Parliament, who will preside over both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). Bapela says the party’s going to look into the feasibility of this. “And if that suggestion and proposals are in effect we’ll then have to amend the Constitution.” The ANC also wants a Chief Whip of Parliament, where the current system provides for chief whips of the majority party and the opposition. Bapela says there was “a strong view” that the National Council of Provinces should be strengthened, with traditional leaders wanting seats in it and organised local government, Salga, which is already represented in the NCOP, wanting the right to vote.
