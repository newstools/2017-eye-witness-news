                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says it's concerned and worried about plans by the United States to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. American President Donald Trump is expected to announce on Wednesday evening that his government recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  Leaders in the Middle East and elsewhere have warned that such a move would have grave implications for the peace process and on regional stability.  The party's Dipuo Letsatsi-Dube said: “Obviously, we are concerned to say what are the ulterior motives? We are really watching that space and we are worried.” At the same time, the Arab league has confirmed it will hold an emergency meeting on Jerusalem on Saturday.
