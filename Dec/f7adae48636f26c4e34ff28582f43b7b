                                         JOHANNESBURG - There's some good news for frustrated First National Bank (FNB) customers. The bank says all services have now been restored following a system glitch. Users had been experiencing problems on its online banking and mobile applications from the early hours of Thursday morning. The bank says the malfunction took longer than expected to rectify. FNB's technology spokesperson Peter Alkema said: “When we had to start restoring all the features properly, there’s a lot of work to do to reconcile transactions that are held in a pending state and which need to be converted to transactions.” FNB has apologised for the inconvenience.
