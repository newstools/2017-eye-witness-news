                                         JOHANNESBURG - Both African National Congress (ANC) factions from KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have claimed victory in Friday's ruling in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. Pro-Cyril Ramaphosa campaigners were granted their execution order instructing the PEC to vacate office while the provincial executive appeals the September ruling, nullifying the 2015 PEC. The 27 members of the now nullified executive claim they should still be allowed to participate in the voting process on Saturday because they have been elected by their respective branches to represent them at the conference. Spokesperson for the now dissolved KZN ANC Mdumiseni Ntuli said: "We are happy that the court has granted us the leave to appeal, which obviously is an indication that the High Court has understood that a different court can take a different decision on this matter, rather than what they decided upon when they handed over the judgment. "It’s clear that committee members will have to be complying with the original decision of their branch where they were nominated as delegates to the national conference.” Meanwhile, the applicants in the KZN ANC court case say the execution order will give the organisation time to work on restoring integrity. Spokesperson for the applicants in the court case Sthembiso Mshengu says the execution order will give the ANC time to reflect. "We believe that the incoming NEC must be given an opportunity to actually appoint a task team and renew the organisation from the ground upwards." ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe says Friday's court cases will have very little impact on Saturday's conference and no one will be turned away from the venue.
