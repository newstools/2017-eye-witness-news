                                         JOHANNESBURG- The former outspoken African National Congress (ANC) MP, Makhosi Khoza, says South Africans must free Treasury and the South African Revenue Service (Sars) from state capture. She officially introduced her new political party, African Democratic Change, on Saturday. This is a fourth breakaway party from the ANC since democracy, following the formation of the United Democratic Movement, Congress of the People and the Economic Freedom Fighters. Khoza says the party will contest the upcoming 2019 general elections because it’s a home for people who want a corruption-free government. The former ANC parliamentarian says she has opted to create her own political party because there’s currently no option from the existing political parties. “There are people that are so disillusioned, they are not finding an alternative out of all these parties that are in existence. The ANC, at where it is, is very fractured and I don’t think it can unite South African.” WATCH: African Democratic Change launched  Meanwhile, Khoza has said her newly formed political party plans to win elections based on integrity and honest leadership. Khoza has described her new party as a new force of change that will work to solve problems faced by South Africans, especially the poor. Khoza says honest leadership is one the most important factors that will sustain the party.
