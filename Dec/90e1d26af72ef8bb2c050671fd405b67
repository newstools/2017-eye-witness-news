The United Nations Children's Fund says many minors aren't receiving treatment, adding one of its biggest concerns. Global head of HIV programming at Unicef Chewe Luo explains: “If we’re going to end this epidemic, we have to close the gap in new infections, especially with adolescent girls, young women, future mothers and future fathers.”
