PARYS - Ace Magashule has been re-elected unopposed as provincial African National Congress (ANC) chairperson in the Free State, continuing as the longest-serving provincial leader. His deputy Thabo Manyoni, who boycotted the provincial elective conference, rejected a nomination for the same position. The party was meant to hold this gathering last month but the Bloemfontein High Court ordered that it cannot go ahead until 29 branches in four regions rerun their branch general meetings constitutionally. Paseka Nompondo has been elected deputy chair while William Bulwane has been re-elected as secretary. Mamiki Qabathe is his deputy and Mosebenzi Zwane is treasurer general. The announcement was made by an election agent at the conference. “For the position of chairperson, I officially declare comrade Ace Magashule.”
