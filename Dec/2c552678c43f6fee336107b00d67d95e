                                         CAPE TOWN - Some medical and health sector students seeking internships say the Health Department has once again failed them with poor systems. A website showing placement allocations for community service and internships went live on Friday morning. The department has admitted that communication and the entire online placement process has been poor this year. Several frustrated students, who are still without placements, have told EWN the website where they were supposed to check for allocations on Friday has added to their worries. In some cases, it shows students have either been placed randomly, with their three choice areas totally ignored, or there's simply no new information showing. “It still says that we are second rounded, and other people have been placed. So, it just still says ‘second-rounded’.”“Nothing new has been told to me, same information.” Intern doctor Ziyanda Mncwango, who has received her first choice for community service placement, says the website is still flawed. “Initially it said we were allocated a facility and gave us the option to accept or reject but the site crashed and when it came back online that option was no longer there.” EWN is still waiting on the Health Department for comment.
