                                         BENGALURU - Chelsea consolidated third place in the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Southampton at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, thanks to a Marcos Alonso goal. Alonso scored the only goal of the game by curling a long-range free-kick past goalkeeper Fraser Forster and into the bottom corner in the third minute of first-half injury time. Chelsea dominated the match for long periods and would have won by a greater margin had Forster not made a string of impressive saves. Southampton improved after sending on Charlie Austin for Manolo Gabbiadini in the second half but they were unable to snatch an equaliser. The result extended a poor run of form for Mauricio Pellegrinoâ€™s side, who have now gone five matches without a win in the Premier League and have dropped to 12th in the standings.
