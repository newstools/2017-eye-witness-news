                                         JERUSALEM - US President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday evening to announce that Washington recognises Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.  Such a statement breaks decades of American foreign policy and has infuriated the Arab world. Palestinian leaders are holding emergency meetings to plan their reaction to a statement they've warned will meet with dangerous consequences. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has urged the Pope and world leaders to intervene. Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state and should Trump say he recognises the city as Israel’s capital, they’ve threatened to break ties with his American administration. Protest rallies across the West Bank have been called for, while Israeli government ministers have reportedly been instructed by the White House not to speak publicly on the matter. PROTESTS Protesters have been gathering in Gaza ahead of Trump’s expected announcement that he will recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Trump is also set to begin relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. There are fears his decision will defy explicit appeals from allied leaders in the Middle East and Europe and could damage American foreign policy goals and relationships. For the president, he’s fulfilling a campaign promise: "We’ll move the American Embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem." Israeli officials hope Trump will finally make good. “President Trump, I encourage you to do the right thing, recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and bring the US Embassy home to Jerusalem.” But there is a reason the move was never made. Every previous US president, both Democrats and Republicans, since 1995, understood the potential consequences.
