                                         BENGALURU - Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser has the ability to become a top player but must showcase his talents more consistently, the Premier League club’s manager Eddie Howe has said. Fraser has established himself as a regular under Howe since joining Bournemouth in 2013. The 23-year-old scored his first goal of the campaign in last Sunday’s 1-1 league draw with Southampton. “For whatever reason, he has had a slightly stuttering start to the season and we haven’t quite seen him at his fluent best,” Howe is quoted as saying by the Daily Echo. ”His performance against Southampton was a sign of him really returning to that form and, if he can, he is going to be a huge player for us. “I can’t speak highly enough of his ability as a player – I just hope he shows it on a consistent basis.” Bournemouth have lost just one of their last five league games to climb out of the relegation zone into 14th position and travel to 18th-placed Crystal Palace on Saturday.
