                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Sunday Times is reporting that former South African Airways (SAA) chairperson Dudu Myeni has been appointed as special adviser to Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi. The paper also reveals that government is considering moving the national carrier to the Transport Ministry from National Treasury, where it’s currently placed. The country’s top banks, however, have warned that they may recall some R8 billion that SAA owes to the banks if the airline is removed from Treasury. The banks and Investec are believed to have written to SAA introducing the new loan agreement that changes to its shareholder would trigger a recall. The Finance Minister’s spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete has told the Sunday Times that the department is not aware of any plans to move SAA. However, the Transport Minister has confirmed that a national review to move the airline to his department is underway.
