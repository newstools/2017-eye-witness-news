                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will open a case against Eskom’s Matshela Koko on Monday, calling his disciplinary hearing a sham. The opposition party says Koko has been re-instated as Eskom’s CEO and cleared of all charges relating to misconduct. However, during a special general meeting at the power utility’s headquarters on Friday afternoon, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said she hadn't been briefed about the outcome of the disciplinary hearing. Eskom’s Chair Zethembe Khoza says no decision has been made. “We’ve received the report and the question it still has to go through processes within the board, then advise the shareholder before announcing it.” WATCH: Eskom's top 3 cagey on financials  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
