                                         CAPE TOWN - Working on Fire says it's still not clear what caused one of their helicopters to crash in Bredasdorp in Western Cape. The helicopter was coming in to land on the Bredasdorp helipad after a demonstration flight on Thursday. The pilot was not injured but a ground crew member had to be hospitalised. Working on Fire's Trevor Abrahams said: “The investigative team has concluded initial site visit and interviews with relevant personnel and there will be follow up investigation of the wreckage probably in the new year.”
