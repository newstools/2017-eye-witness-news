                                         JOHANNESBURG - Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown says Eskom's new board must make appointing a new CEO an "absolute priority." The role of CEO has been beset by controversy and scandal the company's acting CEO Matshela Koko is facing disciplinary action over contracts awarded to a company linked to his step daughter. Brown announced the appointment of a new board yesterday, which will continue to be chaired by Zethembe Khoza. “The board to be led by Mr Khoza until the 2018 AGM will be further reinforced by filling the vacancy with the appropriate expertise from the business sector.” The board comprises seven of the interim non-executive directors and two new ones.
