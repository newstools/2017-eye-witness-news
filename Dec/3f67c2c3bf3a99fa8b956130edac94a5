                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police have arrested and charged a biker at the Erasmia off-ramp in Tshwane who was caught travelling at 200 kilometres per hour in an 80-kilometre zone. The man was taken to the local police station where he was charged with reckless driving on Thursday. Gauteng’s traffic police say they’ll remain on high alert on the roads during this festive period. Spokesperson Busaphi Nxumalo said: “He says he was rushing to work. But even if you’re in a rush, our road users must understand that speeding is one of the contributing factors [to accidents]. More people are dying on our roads.”
