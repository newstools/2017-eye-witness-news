                                         BLOEMFONTEIN – The Free State African National Congress’s (ANC) elective conference has now started after almost a 10-hour delay. The gathering was delayed-with the party saying it was due to the registration of delegates. The party is expected to nominate the new leadership, which may be uncontested as some branches together with the provincial party’s deputy chair Thabo Manyoni are boycotting the gathering. Provincial Chair Ace Magashule says: “It’s up to the conference to say we are divided or united. It’s up to you as delegates. Today you must express your views without any fear, its your conference as members of the ANC.”  The conference which was scheduled to start at 10am has yet to convene. Earlier, the Free State ANC Secretary William Bulwana said was unclear who Secretary General Gwede Mantashe will be sending to represent top officials at the gathering.
