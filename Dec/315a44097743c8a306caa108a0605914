                                         CAPE TOWN - Beaufort West is still facing a massive water crisis, despite additional water sources being brought on line. Disaster relief organisation Gift of the Givers has donated five boreholes to the Karoo town. The municipality is currently exploring alternatives to prevent a complete shutdown. The Great Karoo Town is currently relying on 35 boreholes and a reclamation plant for drinking water.  Every day 500,000 litres are pumped from the five boreholes donated by Gift of the Givers. Mayor Jacob van der Linde says the water crisis is the worst he’s experienced in his 62 years in the town.  “This water which was given to us or the five boreholes… you can’t withdraw more than 500,000 litres. So, it’s only a replacement of what was lost with the two bores that went dry (sic).” He adds additional boreholes can be explored at a cost of R23 million. The reclamation plant delivers around 1.8 million litres of drinkable water per day.  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
