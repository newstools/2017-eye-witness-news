                                         JOHANNESBURG - While there’s still no indication from the Presidency on Jacob Zuma's next move, calls have started to emerge for him not to appeal Wednesday’s High Court judgment on the remedial action in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report. The South African Council of Churches (SACC) is urging Zuma not to appeal, saying it wouldn’t be the ethically correct thing to do. General secretary Malusi Mpumlwana said: “So much money of the state has already been used on what the judge has referred to as a reckless litigation process. And any further appeal of this is just really just extending the same thing.” As African National Congress delegates prepare for the national conference this weekend, where a new leadership will be elected, Mpumlwana says the gathering has some tough decisions to make. “That is a decision they have to make. That is a choice they have - who they elect to achieve that will be up to the delegates at the conference.”
