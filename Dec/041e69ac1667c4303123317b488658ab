                                         LONDON - With less than three weeks until Christmas, hundreds of turkeys have made an unlikely break for freedom after a trailer carrying the birds overturned in the UK.  The accident caused headaches for motorists but generated a social media frenzy. Around 640 turkeys were being transported in a trailer when it overturned near a roundabout serving one of the UKâ€™s busiest motorways, in the south-west of the country. No-one was injured but police and fire crews joined animal welfare experts in trying to recapture hundreds of the birds, as bemused motorists tried to get past the chaotic scene. Images of the rescue mission spread widely on social media.  Investigators have been looking into the cause of the accident but so far there are no suggestions the turkeys were victims of fowl play!
