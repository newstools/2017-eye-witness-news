                                         PRETORIA - The Law Society of the Northern Provinces has told Eyewitness News it's received a report in its investigation of Gupta attorney Gert van der Merwe’s finances but it’s unclear when the probe will be completed. Eyewitness News revealed in June that Van der Merwe is “a Section 204 witness” and is seeking indemnity in a fraud and corruption case involving a former Limpopo Health MEC and a businessman.  Van der Merwe describes in a 2014 affidavit how he used his attorney trust account to channel funds from the businessman to the politician, the MEC had allegedly irregularly awarded a tender to the businessman’s companies.  Van der Merwe is taking this long to complete because the nature of the investigation requires the involvement of experts.  It has, however, confirmed that an investigation report into Van der Merwe’s accounting records was received last week.  This report must still be considered by the society’s investigating committee which will then make recommendations on the next steps to be taken.  Van der Merwe maintains he never knowingly or intentionally participated in any criminal activity.  He’s also co-operated with the Law Society’s investigation.
