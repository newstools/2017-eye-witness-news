                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has opened a case with the Cape Town police against Deputy Finance Minister Sfiso Buthelezi and former Prasa chief executive Lucky Montana for financial mismanagement. This stems from the findings of leaked forensic reports commissioned by Treasury into 193 contracts entered into between 2012 and 2016. Buthelezi was the chairperson of the board at the time. The Public Protector in her 2015 “Derailed” report instructed all procurement contracts over a value of R10 million be investigated. The DA’s Manny de Freitas said: “What’s come through already from investigations by Treasury, is major corruption, maladministration, irregularities and even Prasa’s own regulations weren't met."  When Prasa’s new board chairperson Tintswalo Makhubele appeared before Parliament two weeks ago, she said she needed more time to study the forensic reports before discussing their contents.
