                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) national chair Baleka Mbete  says if delegates enter the elective conference in the spirit of unity, they will disappoint those who've negatively predicted the gathering's collapse. Hundreds of delegates are at the Olive Convention Centre in Durban on Monday for the KwaZulu-Natal provincial general council. The theme for the gathering is "radical socio-economic transformation now". Preliminary results indicate that the province will endorse Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to become the ANC's next president. Meanwhile, in Limpopo, the ANC's provincial general council is being held at Bolivia Lodge in Polokwane. Delegates there have been singing songs in favour of their preferred candidates. Provincial chairperson Stan Mathabatha has asked them to sing unifying songs. “Let us make sure that we sing the songs and slogans which are going to unite us. And this is a very passionate plea from this leadership.”  #ANCKZNPGC Mbete: Our preoccupation will be to discuss issues of how to assist the poorest of the poor in our society.We're not going there to fight.
