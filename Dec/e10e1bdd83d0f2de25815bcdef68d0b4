                                         CAPE TOWN - The South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) says more young people attempt suicide at this time of year due to mounting pressure and anxiety over exam results.  Last week a Soshanguve teenager threw himself onto the railway tracks after learning he had failed grade 11.  Sadag's Zamo Mbele says the anxiety that comes with the pressure at school and the uncertainty of change is not limited to high school learners. “Whether its attempted or successful suicide, it definitely goes up at this time of the year. And we see a trend that from September to January, we see a lot younger people attempting suicide. This can be a result of a few things, including the anxiety around the exam results, that’s all the way from high school to through to varsity learners.”
