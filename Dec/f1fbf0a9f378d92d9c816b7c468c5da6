                                         JOHANNESBURG - Lonmin says it is engaging all interested parties on ways to minimize job cuts at its operations. The mining giant has refuted claims of it planning to cut spending on social and labour projects. In October, the platinum miner announced plans to cut over 1,000 jobs due to persistently low commodity prices and rising costs. Lonmin's Wendy Tlou says that while cutting spending on social and labour projects, which include housing and human resource development, is being considered by the company, it is only one part of a prospective plan. “We identified something like 12 areas that we could look at and one of those that was proposed is that we could look at cutting of costs in the SOPs.” At the same time, Solidarity’s Gideon du Plessis they are engaging the mine. “Monday will be the third round of the consultation process that trade unions have with Lonmin.” With a share price that’s dropped over 22% in the past month and over 400 employees who risk losing their jobs, Du Plessis says they will not tolerate any forceful retrenchments.
