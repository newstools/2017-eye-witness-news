                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) has confirmed that prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams has been put on notice not to withdraw fraud and corruption charges against President Jacob Zuma.  The Constitutional Court issued the directive after the group asked it to confirm the High Court order which set aside Abrahams' appointment.  The full bench in Pretoria also ordered that Zuma play no role in the appointment of a new National Director of Public Prosecutions, because he is conflicted.  Casac says Abrahams may not make a decision in respect of Zuma’s criminal charges because his appointment is in dispute.  The Constitutional Court has given any party wishing to oppose Casac’s application until 19 January.  The organisation has given Abrahams until the first week in January to provide assurances that he will not seek to withdraw charges against the president.  Casac says if Abrahams does not provide such an undertaking, they may apply for an interdict to this effect.
