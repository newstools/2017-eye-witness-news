JOHANNESBURG The Gupta family has given their first reaction to the reports based on internal emails, showing them giving instructions to ministers, saying to Eyewitness News that they believe the reports are fake news.On Sunday morning, both the Sunday Times and the City Press newspapers reported that the internal emails showed how the family paid for trips for Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and former acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko.They also published part of an emailed draft letter in which President Jacob Zuma asked for a secondary residency in the United Arab Emirates.The Gupta's attorney Gert van der Merwe says he's spoken to the family since these reports were first published this morning. Their instruction to me was that what you read in newspapers is not the truth and according to them is fake news. But the reports quote extensively from these emails.They show Des van Rooyen's trip to Dubai for a day in 2015 was paid for by the Gupta family despite his claims that he paid for it.They also detail how Gupta employees gave Mosebenzi Zwane advice on how to deal with the media.Read the Gupta family's official statement.(Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
