The Minister of Public Enterprises is facing a barrage of questions from MPs about Brian Molefe&#8217;s reinstatement as Eskom chief executive officer. CAPE TOWN - Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown is facing a barrage of questions from MPs as the Public Enterprises portfolio committee demands answers about Brian Molefe s reinstatement as Eskom chief executive.Brown says she had withdrawn her opposition to the first part of the DA s legal case to stop Molefe from continuing in the role.Board chairman Ben Ngubane is, however, refusing to answer MPs' questions, saying he s been advised by his lawyer not to do so.MPs are outraged, saying the Molefe matter has made the country a laughing stock.Brown says under Eskom s earlier governance regulations she was not required to be privy to Molefe s appointment as chief executive officer.She told the committee she was under the impression he had resigned when he announced he was leaving the company in December.Brown says that the first she learnt of a R30 million pension payout was when she was approached by the media in April.This, she says, was also the first time she learnt he had requested early retirement.&quot;So I didn't expect that society would universally welcome news of Mr Molefe's return to Eskom following the allegations levelled against him in the Public Protector's State of Capture report.&quot;Brown said she supported Molefe s return to the parastatal last week as long as it was legal, believing his reinstatement would be more valuable to the company than paying him R30 million.WATCH: Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown explains Molefe reinstatementRead Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown's full statement on Brian Molefe here.
