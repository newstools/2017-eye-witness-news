JOHANNESBURG Former African National Congress (ANC) treasurer-general Mathews Phosa says the reason why Jacob Zuma has survived so long as president is because the party s National Executive Committee (NEC) doesn t take its responsibilities seriously.Phosa was speaking on the sidelines of the exhibition gallery of the Promises and Lies project at the University of Johannesburg.He recently announced that he will be submitting his name to be an ANC presidential candidate in June when nominations officially open.Phosa says that at an executive level, the party s National Executive Committee can t ask the party to unite around corruption.He says President Zuma only survives because the NEC protects him. And where it comes from, is that comrades in the NEC are not taking their responsibilities seriously. Phosa says he was warned not to call for President Zuma to step down for fear of his life. That s why he s surviving. When they decide to take the moral highway, he won t survive. He says many of the mistakes made by the ANC since the losses incurred during last year s local elections have been self-inflicted.WATCH: Mathews Phosa: Zuma taking steps towards dictatorship(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
