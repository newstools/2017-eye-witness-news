The ANC has called for government and Parliament to deal decisively with what it calls an &#8216;irrational and untenable&#8217; situation. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress (ANC) has said Eskom s response to Parliament s questions on the reinstatement of Brian Molefe as the utility's Chief Executive Officer is disingenuous and amounts to perjury.Reacting to presentations made by Eskom to the public enterprises committee in Parliament today, the ANC has called for government and Parliament to deal decisively with what it calls an irrational and untenable situation.Earlier today both Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and Eskom chair Ben Ngubane said there were documents to back up their decisions around why Molefe was first allowed to leave the utility and later reinstated.But ANC Member of Parliament Pravin Gordhan asked Eskom to release all of the documents involved in these decisions.The party s spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says it's clear that the version of events given by power utility keeps changing. There is too much incoherence in the version and at the same time, there is so much contradiction. That s why we say that Parliament must deal with this as we directed last week that we want out government to deal with this issue with the clear suggestion from the ANC that let that decision be rescinded and withdrawn.
