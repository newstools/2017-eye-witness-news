President Jacob Zuma says he is not opposed to establishing a commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture. JOHANNESBURG President Jacob Zuma says he is not opposed to establishing a commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture.The presidency has released a statement on Friday morning saying that recent reports that he s opposed to the implementation of the remedial action recommended by the public protectors are incorrect.However, the president says some of the remedial actions are irregular, unlawful and unconstitutional.Meanwhile, a group of academics studying state capture say Zuma is not just at the centre of a criminal network but is actually at the core of a group of people who have managed to re-purpose state institutions to benefit a few networks.They also point to the same group of people they say are all connected to the networks of the Zuma family and the Gupta family.The report was compiled with information passed on by the South African Council of Churches, which said last week that information given to its un-burdening panel, showed South Africa was on the brink of becoming a mafia state.The authors of this report explain in detail how they say the network centred around Zuma and the Gupta family operates and how Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba played a key role in setting it up.They also claim that what has happened actually amounts to a silent coup.The authors say that people who have tried to resist this such as former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, former deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas and former government spokesperson Themba Maseko have been systematically removed, given other lucrative jobs to silence them, or hounded out through the use of dubious intelligence reports.The study also says that for this crisis to be resolved this entire network needs to be broken up.But the authors also say the country needs a new national economic consensus - in which real economic transformation occurs.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
