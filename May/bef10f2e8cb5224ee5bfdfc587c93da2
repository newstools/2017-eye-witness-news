Lawyers of the men accused of the rape and murder of Sinoxolo Mafevuka argue anyone could've tampered with the crime scene. CAPE TOWN Lawyers of the men accused of the rape and murder of Sinoxolo Mafevuka in Khayelitsha have argued anyone could've tampered with the crime scene.Cousins Xolisa and Athabile Mafilika have pleaded not guilty.The first responding officer has testified several items were found in the toilet cubicle where the 19-year-old's body was discovered in March last year.Advocate Mornay Calitz, who represents Xolisa, says there was an eight-hour gap between the time witnesses claim they heard a woman's scream after midnight and the time Constable Nomampondomise Gobodo arrived on the scene just after 8am.She says a small group of people was already gathered in front of the communal toilets in SST Town Two.Gobodo says she immediately cordoned off the area and made sure no one touched the crime scene.But Calitz argues anyone could've tampered with the toilet cubicle in which Mafevuka's body was stuffed before the officer arrived.He also suggests anyone could've placed items, now deemed evidence, at the crime scene.Officers found sunglasses, two tops, a Panama hat, a bra and a pair of panties in the cubicle.A jersey had been draped over the 19-year-old's waist.
