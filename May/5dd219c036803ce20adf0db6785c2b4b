That was my fight with the police all the years. I had noticed three or four years ago that the police are not as effective as they should be in the area. I think if all of us had responded much sooner in this case we could ve found Courtney Pieters much sooner. WATCH: Mbalula promises Elsies River its own satellite police stationMitchells Plain Crisis Forum s Joanie Fredericks says safety groups will also be applying pressure on national government to keep to its word. I really think that this time things are going to change. You heard what the minister of police said, commitments were made publicly and we re going to follow up on them. We re going to ensure that we hold the president of this country and the minister of police accountable. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
