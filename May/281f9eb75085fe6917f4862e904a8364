JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has been heckled by the Democratic Alliance (DA) during his budget vote address in Parliament. The president was talking about a better life for all South Africans when DA MPs chimed in, saying achieving that would mean Zuma s resignation and relocation to Dubai. Zuma has also told MPs there is no opposition from the government or the Presidency for a commission of inquiry into State Capture.He s also admitted the recent downgrade of the country to junk status by global ratings agencies makes transforming the economy difficult. As we seek to radically transform the economy we need to be mindful of the structural challenges as the South African economy continues to be driven by consumption and global demand for mineral commodities. WATCH: The Presidency budget voteINQUIRY INTO STATE CAPTUREPresident Zuma says he is not opposed to an inquiry into State Capture.The president said he wanted to set the record straight, that by challenging the Public Protector s report on State Capture, it did not mean that he didn t want an investigation.Amid a flurry of State Capture allegations against President Zuma and several Cabinet ministers, Zuma says there is a misperception that he does not want an inquiry. We fully support an inquiry as it will help to uncover facts and remove rumours about the extent of State Capture. But Zuma says he s had to challenge the Public Protector s report on State Capture, because of the manner in which it directs that remedial action be carried out. It infringes on the right of the president and if left unattended it will set a wrong precedent for future presidents. Zuma says the Public Protector s report undermines the doctrine of a separation of powers, but he hoped that the matter will be resolved soon.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
