The party has pressed criminal charges based on the release of email correspondence between the Guptas, Zuma, some ministers and other prominent persons. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it's lodged criminal charges against President Jacob Zuma, members of the Gupta family, several cabinet ministers and senior employees at some state-owned entities in the wake of the Gupta email revelations.Over the weekend both the Sunday Times and the City Press newspapers published emails showing the Gupta family was in direct contact with Cabinet ministers.The DA says it shows they are guilty of criminal acts and that the emails form a paper trail.The party's James Selfe says they've also lodged a charge of treason against the group. What happened here is that in this case a foreign family managed to buy the entire structure of the state, and that constitutes, at least,putatively treason.
