JOHANNESBURG The South African Council of Churches (SACC) has called on the ANC to act fast in addressing allegations contained in its unburdening report saying the claims are serious and threaten government s capability.The organisation has released its unburdening report which reveals damning information from current and former government employees on how the stage has been captured by private individuals.They say the report was triggered by former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas' revelation that the Guptas had offered him Rs6 million for a position of finance minister.The organisation says many people opted to provide the information anonymously.SACC s general secretary Malusi Mpumlwana says people provided them with information of how the state has been captured. Careful analysis makes the case for the following observatory trends of inappropriate control of state systems through a power elite that is pivoted around the president. That is systemically syphoning the assets of the state. He says this has pushed them to conclude government has lost its moral compass. It seems clear to us that government has lost its moral compass that should inform the public service of Batho Pele. While the organisation says it started the unburdening panel after the ANC failed to deal with allegations of state capture it will still refer this report to the party.
