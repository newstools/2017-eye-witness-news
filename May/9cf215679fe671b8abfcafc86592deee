A new report says that a power elite centred around Jacob Zuma has built a symbiotic relationship between the constitutional state and the shadow state to execute this coup. JOHANNESBURG A group of academics working with the South African Council of Churches (SACC) on state capture says South Africa has experienced a silent coup that has removed the African National Congress (ANC) from its place as the primary force for transformation in society.The report says that a power elite centred around President Jacob Zuma has managed to build a symbiotic relationship between the constitutional state and what it calls a shadow state to execute this coup.Last week the SACC said that the evidence brought before its unburdening panel showed that the country was on the brink of becoming a mafia state.The report was written by nine academics and one journalist and says people are wrong to believe that President Zuma is at the centre of a criminal network that has captured the state.They claim that actually, there is a political project at work to repurpose state instructions to help a group of networks make money from the government at the expense of the poor.The group says that at the centre of this group are the same handful of people and companies connected to what it calls the Zuma-Gupta family network.They specifically mention Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and the role they say he played in ensuring that people linked to the Gupta family were given seats on the boards of several state-owned enterprises (SOEs).The report says that the only way to resolve this crisis is to dismantle the entire network.Read 'Betrayal of the promise: How South Africa is being stolen' below: Betrayal of a Promise FINAL by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
