As much as African leaders enjoy slating the three permanent Western members of the United Nations Security Council, they rely heavily on them to keep the continent atop the list of development aid recipients.Africa gets $54,183 million a year. That is nearly a third of the $161,075 million coming from donors.Ethiopia, Egypt, Kenya and Tanzania are the biggest recipients.The biggest donors are currently the United States which takes up 31% of the aid, Britain at 13% and France which picks up 11%.There are going to be changes.Britain and France also contribute to European Union development aid to Africa. The EU is the largest multilateral donor. Britain s exit from the EU is unlikely to change that fact, although the amount coming from Brussels will diminish.In Washington, President Donald Trump has given notice that the development aid budget will be skinnier - a cut of 28% is expected.Cutting US foreign aid to Africa could turn the continent into a recruiting field for terrorists, the head of the African Development Bank (AfDB) tells Newsweek magazine.Akinwumi Adesina, the president of the 78-member AfDB - Africa s version of the World Bank - says that cash from Washington plays a vital role in creating jobs in rural parts of Africa, where young people may otherwise turn to extremism when faced with unemployment and poverty due to environmental issues or conflict.British Premier Theresa May s refusal at prime minister s questions to guarantee the future of the country s annual foreign aid budget got Africa watchers jittery.May has subsequently moved to quash speculation that the government could drop its pledge to spend 0.7% of national income a year on foreign aid. The commitment remains and will remain , she insists.May has stressed the need to spend the money more effectively.Her apparent hesitation prompted a warning from Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, who said any cut would cost lives and erode UK influence abroad. World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim echoed Gates s warning, and the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams defended the aid commitment as a badge of honour for Britain.France s new President Emmanuel Macron seems to be adopting the most muscular African policy of the so-called P3.Macron has been elected to serve France's interests and he will do so in his relationship with Africa, political analyst Serge Theophile Balima told the BBC.&quot;Macron is a neo-liberal who believes in businesses and trade,&quot; Balima says.&quot;He will do his utmost to open Africa to a maximum of French businesses.&quot;Macron believes that partnership with the continent will be more beneficial if Africa is strong.He has vowed to lobby the G20 at its July summit in Germany to support economic development in African countries.He has also pledged to channel to Africa most of France's foreign aid, which he intends to increase to 0.7% of his country's GDP.Visiting Mali shortly after his inauguration, Macron gave substance to his promise to fight Islamist militants in the Sahel.He believes France is not the only country affected by this scourge.&quot;Africa is struggling more and more with terrorism,&quot; he told the magazine iJeune Afrique.&quot;Everyone should get involved in the fight against terrorism,&quot; he said.France has deployed about 4,000 troops in that dangerous region of Africa as part of the anti-terrorism Barkhane operation.Speaking in the northern Malian city of Gao, Macron says the troops will continue to be deployed.However, economic development will be pushed as hard as the military aid because, he says, it is necessary to win the war as well as the peace.Jean-Jacques Cornish is an Africa correspondent at Eyewitness News.
