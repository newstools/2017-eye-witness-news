The former Western Cape police commissioner and three other police officials face 109 charges. CAPE TOWN - The second week of the corruption trial against former Western Cape police commissioner Arno Lamoer and four others resumes in the Western Cape High Court.Lamoer, along with police officials Darius van der Ross, Sharon and Kolindren Govender and Cape businessman Saleem Dawjee, faces 109 charges.The officers are accused of accepting money and expensive gifts worth more than R1.6 million from Dawjee in exchange for preferential treatment.On Tuesday, the defence will continue cross-examining Hawks financial investigator Wynand Wessels.Wessels last week detailed payments and gifts that Lamoer and three brigadiers had received from Dawjee between 2011 and 2013.The gifts included money, car rentals, pool maintenance, plane tickets and clothing account payments.The defence has thus far questioned the Hawks financial investigator's capabilities and experience and also wanted to know why the matter was not handed to independent auditors instead.The accused have all pleaded not guilty to all counts of corruption, racketeering and money laundering they face.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
