Dam levels are now at 22,8%, which is 0,6% down from a week ago.With the last 10% of a dam's water mostly not being useable, the dams effectively have 12,8% of water left.Cosatu's Tony Ehrenreich is accusing the municipality of not putting measures in place to address the situation. There has been no contingency plan to ensure that there s drinking water for the people of Cape Town. The key responsibility of the mayor is to lead this place. If she can t, she must step down. The mayor's spokesperson, Zara Nicholson, says they are dealing with the current crisis. We invite Mr Ehrenreich to come to the City for a meeting so that we can explain to him what we re doing about the crisis. The city says it is finalising proposals for further intensified water restrictions, subject to due process. Officials have urged residents to stop using municipal water for all outside use, including for watering the garden and filling up pools, even on the currently allowed watering days.The city is also continuing with extensive pressure reduction programmes to reduce the flow of water at a time, as well as water losses through leakage in the pipework of the distribution system. The regulation of supply is underway in the central, southern and eastern suburbs. This will soon be expanded to the northern suburbs, the city said in a statement.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
