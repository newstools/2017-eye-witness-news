They said the reason for that is the boycott, and the boycott is for right-wingers and then the clients hear you are saying we are a bunch of right-wingers , and we are not. LISTEN: Spur CEO on open letter to trade union SolidarityOn Thursday Spur CEO Pierre van Tonder wrote an open letter to Solidarity in which he stated: I would have expected that you, as a trade unionist with influence in the Afrikaans community, would have informed yourself thoroughly before expressing support for a boycott of this kind, especially as this campaign is hurting the very Afrikaans people you claim were hard done by Spur. Van Tonder says the boycott will not only affect franchises financially but may leave current employees jobless should any of them close. In fact, your union Solidarity has members in the franchises against whom you are encouraging a boycott. Their livelihood is at stake now, but instead of acting in workers' best interest
