EFF leader Julius Malema says work is underway to lure ANC MP's to vote with them. JOHANNESBURG - As the Constitutional Court deliberates on arguments presented in the United Democratic Movements bid to allow members of Parliament (MPs) to vote in secret in a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema says they're working hard to convince more African National Congress MPs to vote in support of the motion.Judgment was reserved on Monday after hearing arguments from the applicant, the friends of the court and respondents.Parliament delayed setting a date on the motion of no confidence in Zuma, pending the outcome of the court bid.EFF leader Julius Malema says they are confident the court will rule in their favour. We just want the court to say that it s allowed and permissible. The Constitution encourages that we guarantee the vote of individuals through a secret ballot. In the meantime, he says work is underway to lure ANC MP's to vote with them. We are working day and night. We have put out individuals with the target of 60 to all of them. National Assembly spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the Speaker will appreciate any guidance the court gives. We await any guidance the court can give in this regard because the court exists to interpret the Constitution. Malema says they re convinced Zuma will not be president once a secret ballot is pronounced by the court.WATCH: Opposition still hope for favourable ConCourt ruling over secret ballot(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
