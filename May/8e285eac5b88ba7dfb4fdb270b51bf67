CAPE TOWN - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has told Parliament's finance committee neither his wife nor his advisor will be imposing their views on him.He was answering a barrage of questions from Members of Parliament s standing committee on finance.It was Gigaba s debut before the committee since his appointment in President Jacob Zuma s Cabinet reshuffle at the end of March.His economic advisor Professor Chris Malikane is advocating for the nationalisation of banks and insurers and the expropriation of land without compensation.Norma Gigaba said in an interview she helped her husband find solutions while he was Home Affairs minister.Gigaba has had to deal with MPs' questions about their influence over him. I am the minister, not my advisor and not the DG; I am the minister. It is my views that prevail, it is my policies which I draw from Cabinet and nobody else s. The finance minister added: The advisor had an engagement on 29 April, and what keeps happening is that people keep rehashing his views and I say: I am the minister. Gigaba says radical economic transformation is part of a debate in South Africa that should be neither feared nor suppressed.He reiterated that Treasury will focus on inclusive growth, try to avoid another credit rating downgrade and says hard work is being done to restore South Africa s investment-grade rating after Standard and Poor and Fitch cast it into junk status.The finance minister says it would be wrong to shut down discussions on radical economic transformation. I don t think we need to fear that discussion, we need not suppress it, because essentially you have a country with a particular background. And that background has left a lot of people outside the margins of the economy - unemployed, no assets, no opportunities for economic participation and even no skills. Gigaba says whether it is called inclusive growth or radical economic transformation, the goal is the same to address those excluded from the economy.
