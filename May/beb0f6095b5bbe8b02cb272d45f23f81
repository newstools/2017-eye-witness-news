Scopa is calling for heads to roll at the SABC over a R25 million contract to probe fruitless and wasteful expenditure. CAPE TOWN - Members of Parliament's (MPs) standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) are calling for heads to roll at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) over a R25 million contract to probe fruitless and wasteful expenditure.Audit firm Sekela Xabiso was initially awarded a four-month contract in 2014 at a cost R5 million.But three years later, the forensic audit is still incomplete, and the SABC has paid the company five times the initial amount.The SABC says it had to appoint Sekela Xabiso to conduct the audit because it did not have the internal capacity to do so, something Scopa finds surprising.The public broadcaster's acting chief financial officer Audrey Raphela says the audit was delayed due to poor record keeping. The African National Congress Vincent Smith says the contract must be cancelled, even if penalties must be paid. If you continue to pay them, I will call for your dismissal. You will be the example of delinquent directors. We will take you to task if you spend another cent on it. The board has asked the special investigating unit to probe the contract and have an outcome in August.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
