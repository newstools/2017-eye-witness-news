The party also wants to ask the High Court in a separate application to declare the Cabinet reshuffle unlawful and have it set aside on the basis of irrationality. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) will on Thursday ask the High Court to compel President Jacob Zuma to hand over the intelligence report he allegedly relied on to sack Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The party has approached the High Court in Pretoria to try to obtain the document because it is needed in a separate application to have the Cabinet reshuffle reviewed and set aside. Zuma told senior African National Congress (ANC) officials after firing Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas at the end of March that he relied on an intelligence report which accused the pair of conspiring against him. The DA believes that it is entitled to this intelligence report. The party wants to ask the court in a separate application to declare the reshuffle unlawful and have it set aside on the basis of irrationality. Zuma has, however, argued that because the decision was not administrative in nature, the DA can t make the request. He added that the president s decision to dismiss members of his Cabinet forms part of decisions and deliberations that are protected by the same privilege that protects Cabinet minutes from disclosure.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
