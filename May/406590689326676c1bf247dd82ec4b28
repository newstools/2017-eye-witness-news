This comes after a 22-year-old man was arrested for allegedly raping and sexually assaulting at least 20 pupils at Parktown Boys High School. JOHANNESBURG The Gauteng Education Department has warned schools to always follow procedure when employing teachers and other staff and not just rely on trust. This comes after a 22-year-old man was arrested for allegedly raping and sexually assaulting at least 20 pupils at Parktown Boys High School. It s understood the man, who has resigned from his position as water polo coach, was a former pupil at the same school. The State has indicated to the court that it intends to apply for the case to be transferred to a High Court during the man s next appearance on 11 July. The defence in the case has questioned the legality of a search conducted at the accused s Roodepoort home last Wednesday. Defence attorney Clinton Symes told the court that police searched the accused s home, which he shares with his uncle, without him being there.Symes says that according to the law, the 22-year-old, his legal team and his uncle were supposed to be present when the search was conducted.He says although the uncle was on the premises during the search, he was not present in the room the police were searching.Experts say this could mean the defence is trying to convince the court that the evidence gathered should be inadmissible.
