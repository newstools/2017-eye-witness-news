Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel is the latest person to publicly state that concerns about corruption and state capture are real and legitimate. CAPE TOWN - All eyes will turn to Johannesburg on Friday afternoon, as the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) prepares to meet.The top structures of the ruling party are known to be more divided than ever and it's possible that another motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma will be tabled at the meeting.Zuma's shock Cabinet reshuffle and the subsequent downgrade to junk status have weakened his position, along with the continued concerns around state capture.Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel is the latest person to publicly state that concerns about corruption and state capture are real and legitimate.He told Parliament they are affecting the government s ability to forge the partnerships needed with the rest of society to develop a capable state.Patel was delivering his budget vote address on Thursday and did not mince his words. When there are real and legitimate concerns about corruption and state capture about the diversion of the people s money to improperly benefit individuals, our ability to forge a partnership between the state and the rest of society is seriously undermined. Both Patel and Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies have announced moves to make funding dispenses by their departments more transparent.Patel says the Industrial Development Corporation will from June publish details of all investors to whom it gives industrial funding. Davies says a list of beneficiaries across the DTI s incentives programmes will be published in July.STATE CAPTURE REPORTA group of academics, in a report, claimed that Zuma and the Gupta family have mounted a silent coup in South Africa.The academics released their report on Thursday, which they say shows how Zuma and a network involving his family and the Guptas have taken over the state.The report was written by nine academics and one journalist. The report says people are wrong to believe that Zuma is at the centre of a criminal network that has captured the state.The group claims that there is a political project at work to re-purpose state instructions to help a group of networks make money from the government at the expense of the poor.They add the same handful of people and companies connected to what it calls the &quot;Zuma, Gupta family network&quot; are at the centre of this group.They specifically mention Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and the role they say he played in ensuring that people linked to the Gupta family were given seats on the boards of several state-owned enterprises.The report says that the only way to resolve this crisis is to dismantle the entire network.Read 'Betrayal of the promise: How South Africa is being stolen' below: Betrayal of a Promise FINAL by Primedia Broadcasting on ScribdAdditional reporting by Stephen Grootes.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
