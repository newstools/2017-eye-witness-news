The ANC called the decision &quot;unfortunate and reckless&quot;. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress has condemned the decision taken by the Eskom board to reinstate Brian Molefe as chief executive officer of the parastatal.The ANC in a statement called the decision &quot;unfortunate and reckless&quot;.Eskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma on Friday confirmed that Molefe would return to work on Monday, saying that the board decided to rescind Molefe s pension payout because Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown was not happy about it and decided to come up with a mutually acceptable option to offer Molefe his job back.Brown says she will release a statement on the matter later on Friday.Parliament, meanwhile, has confirmed that Molefe has resigned as a Member of Parliament, effective from Sunday and National Assembly Baleka Mbete has wished him well.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says the party wants to meet with Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown to question why such a decision was taken.&quot;We don't think there can be any convincing really for the board to arrive at that decision. Firstly, she took the correct decision earlier by rejecting the R30m retirement demand and we think even in this context, she has to do what was in the public interest.&quot;He says the ANC is worried about the infiltration of corruption into state-owned companies.&quot;SOEs must not become the infirm, almost like a social corruption. I think that it is important that whatever corruption raises its ugly head, we want to see action being taken.&quot;
