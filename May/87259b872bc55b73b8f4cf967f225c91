The ANC's NEC announced that it wants Brian Molefe&#8217;s appointment as Eskom CEO to be rescinded. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) secretary general Gwede Mantashe says while the party s national executive committee (NEC) wants Brian Molefe to leave Eskom, they won t dictate how he goes.On Monday, the party s NEC announced that it wants Molefe s appointment as CEO to be rescinded.The NEC also decided not to recall President Jacob Zuma from the presidency.Mantashe says they want Molefe out of Megawatt Park but they won t tell Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown exactly what to do. How you resolve it, we can t determine that for the minister. All we re saying is that the minister must resolve this matter before it goes to court because that decision translates into judiciary overreach. He also says it s possible another motion to remove President Zuma could be brought at a future NEC meeting.But Mantashe says many NEC members believe people outside the ANC who want Zuma to step down are actually trying to remove the ANC itself from power.
