JOHANNESBURG Former President FW de Klerk says South Africans must stand up and defend the Constitution through a series of national dialogues.De Klerk, as well as former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe, have joined forces with a number of prolific foundations to launch a series of conversations to discuss the current national crisis.De Klerk says President Jacob Zuma has failed to uphold the Constitution.Meanwhile, Mbeki who addressed those gathered a short while ago said the significance of the dialogue is to ensure that the independent voices of citizens are heard. And I draw attention to this because we held a view, a view I still support, that the national dialogue should not fall victim to the parties and political contests which necessary characterise general elections. The foundations include the Chief Albert Luthuli Foundation, Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation and the Thabo Mbeki Foundation.The foundations have united around a common concern, saying the recent negative developments in the country have generated a national general crisis which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.Issues, including political governance, the Constitution, the state of the economy and national cohesion, will be discussed in a national dialogue intended to bring all South Africans together.The event is the first in a series of planned events and will culminate in a final report, which will become the subject of a national indaba.All sectors of society have been urged to participate in these conversations for better public accountability and governance.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
