Speaker Baleka Mbete appeared confident that some form of inquiry would happen. CAPE TOWN - National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete says it would be desirable to have a commission of inquiry into all matters related to state capture.Speaking during a media briefing on Parliament's budget, Mbete's call follows that of the African National Congress' National Executive Committee which Monday afternoon said it would support a speedy state capture inquiry.The Democratic Alliance has written to Mbete calling for an ad hoc committee to conduct a parliamentary inquiry, following the release of e-mails that point to links between President Jacob Zuma, several Cabinet ministers and the Gupta family.The Public Protector's report on state capture recommended a judicial commission of inquiry.But President Jacob Zuma is appealing that report.On Monday Mbete appeared confident that some form of inquiry would happen. For now there's nothing, but there will be. Mbete said a &quot;structure&quot; would probe state capture in its broadest meaning. I think we will all sleep well once we know that we are having some people pay attention to this monster. Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli says any structure that would investigate state capture, would be &quot;absolutely welcomed&quot;.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
