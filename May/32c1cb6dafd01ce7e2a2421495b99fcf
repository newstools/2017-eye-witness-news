Both Cosatu and the SACP have called on the president to step down following his controversial Cabinet reshuffle, the SACP endorsing Ramaphosa for president. JOHANNESBURG While President Jacob Zuma has criticized the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) for interfering in African National Congress (ANC) matters, his Deputy Cyril Ramaphosa has told the alliance partners not to be silent adding that they have every right to talk about the ANC.Ramaphosa delivered the ANC's message of support at the federation's central committee meeting in Tshwane on Tuesday. Both the alliance partners have called on the president to step down following his controversial Cabinet reshuffle while Cosatu has publicly endorsed Ramaphosa to take over from Zuma at the party's elective conference in December.President Jacob Zuma lashed out just two weeks ago at the SACP and Cosatu.&quot;They have problems, but they never talk about that. They spend time talking about the ANC. They since said we are moving to socialism, when are we getting there? Why are they not discussing that ... fighting for that? We don't hear about the future of workers, we just hear about ANC. On Tuesday Ramaphosa seemed to dismiss that, telling both the alliance partners not to be silenced. We are equal partners in this alliance, and by being equal partners that means that nobody s voice must be muzzled. Nobody must be told to shut up we are all entitled to speak and to voice our concerns. The deputy president says alliance partners have every right to be concerned about what's happening in the ANC.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
