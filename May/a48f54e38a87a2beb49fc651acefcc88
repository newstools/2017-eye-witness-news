LONDON - If the All Blacks were not already aware of the impact Maro Itoje could have on the British and Irish Lions tour, his coach Warren Gatland just painted a big target on the 22-year-old's broad shoulders.Itoje, World Rugby's Breakthrough Player of the Year, had a barnstorming Six Nations for England in the second row and as blindside flanker, and Gatland felt he could be singled out in New Zealand.&quot;He could be a player they may target, and I'll be interested to see how he responds to that,&quot; the former All Blacks hooker told The Telegraph newspaper on Thursday.&quot;They might see him as potentially a key for the Lions and see if they can shut him down, or physically dominate him.&quot;He's going to have to learn from that.&quot;Gatland said while the All Blacks were known for their open, fast-paced game, many overlooked the contribution of their forwards and their ability to muscle up and turn a game into &quot;a bit of a dogfight&quot;.It was in such moments that Itoje might get targeted, Gatland suspected, but the 53-year-old also felt the tour could be the making of the rangy Saracens player.&quot;The more he plays the better he's going to get. He's got a massive engine on him and his work-rate is just phenomenal,&quot; Gatland added.&quot;Hopefully, we can get him to play a little bit smarter in terms of picking his moments, with that youthful enthusiasm of trying all the time.&quot;He's just involved in everything. Just looking at him, he will respond to that challenge.&quot;
