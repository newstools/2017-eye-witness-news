The FW de Klerk Foundation &amp; other organisations are concerned over a report claiming that Zuma &amp; the Guptas mounted a silent coup in SA. JOHANNESBURG The FW de Klerk Foundation, the Centre for Constitutional Rights and the Centre for Unity in Diversity have raised concern over a report by a group of academics, claiming that President Jacob Zuma and the Gupta family have mounted a silent coup in South Africa. The group released their report earlier this week, saying state agencies had been re-purposed to benefit a few networks tied to these families.Last week, the South African Council of Churches said that the evidence brought before its unburdening panel showed that South Africa was on the brink of becoming a mafia state.The foundation says the report reveals a toxic cocktail of patronage and corruption, all while seriously undermining the constitutional state. It s also criticised Zuma's decision to approach the court asking it to set aside the remedial action stated in the State of Capture report. Last year, his lawyers said the recommendations were unconstitutional and that the public protector had no right to tell the president to set up a judicial commission and decide who should chair it. It now remains to be seen whether the outcome of this weekend's NEC meeting will be affected by the claim from the academics that Zuma and a network involving his family and the Gupta family have taken over the state.
