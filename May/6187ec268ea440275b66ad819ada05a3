On Tuesday, a group of people protested outside Mapaila&#8217;s home, saying he must stop publicly criticising Zuma. JOHANNESBURG As the South African Communist Party (SACP) says President Jacob Zuma must distance himself from the people who held a protest outside Solly Mapaila s house on Tuesday, MK Military Veterans Association leader Kebby Maphatsoe is refusing to condemn the protest.On Tuesday, a group of people protested outside Mapaila s home, saying he must stop publicly criticising Zuma.Mapaila has led the SACP s calls for Zuma to resign in his role as the party s second deputy general secretary.He says the fact ANN7 reporters were at this protest at his home proves who s really behind it. You could see it s coordinated from inside the Guptas. I understand why the Guptas would be angry because we re stopping them from stealing the resources of this country. Mapaila has been the public face of the SACP's criticism of Zuma.He says what happened won't stop him. President Zuma has sold out our country. It doesn t matter how they may try to defend him. The evidence has come out. The NEC should have taken the appropriate decision by removing him from office. No amount of intimidation will stop us. Meanwhile, the MKMVA chairman says while a group called the MK Foundation may have arranged this, it wasn't his organisation.But he also won't condemn this action. There are people who have marched to the Union Buildings, there are people who marched to councillor s houses and this has not been a problem. Two years ago, Eyewitness News revealed that Maphatsoe was using twelve soldiers to guard his home through his role as deputy defense minister.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
