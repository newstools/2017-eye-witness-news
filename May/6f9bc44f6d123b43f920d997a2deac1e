I am not captured by anyone. Nor have I ever been captured by anybody and nor will I ever be captured by anybody. Abrahams had been asked about public perceptions that the NPA and other law enforcement agencies were protecting people close to President Jacob Zuma. I think it s irresponsible of anybody to say somebody is captured without any evidence to back it up. Abrahams also denied that the fraud charges brought against Gordhan were vindictive. There was never and there is not a vendetta against the former minister of finance. Amid a public outcry, Abrahams reviewed the case against Gordhan and declined to prosecute.
