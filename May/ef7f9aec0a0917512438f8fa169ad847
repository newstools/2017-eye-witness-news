DA leader Mmusi Maimane sparked the ire of the ANC, saying that supporting the Presidency's budget would be akin to supporting a mafia state. PARLIAMENT - The African National Congress (ANC) and its president, Jacob Zuma, have come under fire in the National Assembly on Wednesday afternoon, with the Democratic Alliance (DA) referring to &quot;president Gupta&quot; and accusing the ruling party of putting corruption before the country. During the debate on the presidency s budget vote DA leader Mmusi Maimane accused the ANC of failing to protect South Africans by continuing to support Zuma. Speaker Baleka Mbete had her hands full as she tried to stop the name calling and restore order. We can t come and pretend here that the president is anything other than the headquarters of the Gupta empire. Maimane sparked the ire of the ANC, saying that supporting the presidency's budget would be akin to supporting a mafia state.Mbete repeatedly ordered him to withdraw his remark against President Zuma. Honourable Maimane there s no president Gupta in this house. As DA chief whip John Steenhuisen came to Maimane s defence, he, in turn, came under attack from the ANC's Mervyn Dirks, who called him a racist white boy. Can you please withdraw white boy. MPs were all ordered to withdraw their unparliamentary remarks before the debate could continue.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
