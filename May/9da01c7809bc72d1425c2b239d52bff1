There is no slight evidence to back up these claims that are being made by agents of white monopoly capital, by the people who are controlled from London and by people funded by newspapers. So no, we are not funded by president Jacob Zuma or the Guptas. President Zuma has no money; we know he had to go and borrow R8 million who can he fund? It s a joke.
