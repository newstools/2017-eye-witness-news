The secretary general says the letter was not a correspondence for the ANC. PRETORIA African National Congress Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe has dismissed an open letter from the party's stalwarts calling on the NEC to reconsider recalling President Jacob Zuma.Mantashe briefed the media yesterday about the NEC meeting underway this weekend at the Saint George's Hotel in Pretoria.Just a day before the ANC held its NEC meeting, the party's stalwarts wrote an open letter to the NEC urging them to reconsider asking the president to step down.The secretary general says the letter was not a correspondence for the ANC. When you sign an open letter, it s not a correspondence for the ANC, it s an open letter to the public. However, Mantashe says the letter can be used by some NEC members to raise issues in the committee. You can regard it as lobbying for members who want to use the letter in the discussion but it s not an item here. It's understood NEC members did use the letter and calls from alliance partners for Zuma to step down to argue why he needs to leave.
