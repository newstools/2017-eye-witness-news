Police are holding eight people in custody in connection with the attack on a packed concert hall, which killed 22 people. LONDON - From news that the number of people injured in the Manchester bombing is double the initial estimate to a collapse of information sharing with America, it's been a day of dramatic developments in Britain.As raids and searches continue, police have made what they are calling significant arrests linked to the bomber and his suspected network.At least twenty-two people were killed at a pop concert on Monday night, 116 others were injured and the UK s terrorist threat level was raised to its highest position in a decade. Of those injured, twenty-three people remain in critical condition while the identities of all the victims have now been made public.The row over intelligence leaks has escalated with Britain saying it will no longer share sensitive information relating to this case with America. Manchester police s Ian Hopkins says, it s absolutely understandable the distress and upset it has caused to those families who're already suffering as everyone can imagine. Police are holding eight people in custody in connection with the attack on a packed concert hall, which killed 22 people. Hopkins said the arrests were significant.A source with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters the bomber, Salman Abedi, might have made the bomb himself or with some assistance from an accomplice. That was a change from previous thinking that a bomb-maker might be at large.Earlier on Thursday, the Queen Elizabeth visited some of those injured in the attack and a moment of silence was observed across the nation.The city s two giant soccer clubs, Manchester United and Manchester City, laid aside their fierce rivalry to jointly donate 1 million to an emergency fund set up to support families affected by the attack. They labelled their initiative A City United .The bombing, targeting as it did children and teenagers, has caused revulsion across the world.Additional information by Reuters.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
