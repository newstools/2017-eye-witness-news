Advocate James Grant says the order was the result of an interlocutory application which is not ordinarily regarded as appealable on the basis. PRETORIA While the African National Congress (ANC) has urged President Jacob Zuma to appeal the High Court s order that he hand over records related to his reshuffle decision , the legal nature of the ruling may make that difficult. The High Court in Pretoria on Thursday ordered the president to surrender to the Democratic Alliance all records related to the decision within five working days. The opposition party wants to use the information in an application to review the reshuffle which led to the controversial firing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. The ANC says President Zuma must appeal the order because it constitutes an unfettered encroachment of the judiciary into the realm of the executive. However, Advocate James Grant says the order was the result of an interlocutory application which is not ordinarily regarded as appealable on the basis that it s not a final order of the court. But he says there are exceptions to the rule. The president has until Wednesday to give notice of his intention to appeal.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
