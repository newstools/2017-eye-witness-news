CAPE TOWN - The trial of two men accused of the rape and murder of Sinoxolo Mafevuka in Khayelitsha is expected to start in the Western Cape High Court on Monday.The cousins, Athabile and Xoliswa Mafilika, have been in police custody since their arrest last year.Mafevuka's body was found in a communal toilet about 500m from her home in March 2016.The accused allegedly strangled the 19-year-old woman because they were jealous of her relationship with a man from Khayelitsha.They have previously stated they will plead not guilty.During a bail hearing last year, it emerged that a witness saw the men drag Mafevuka towards the public toilets in the SST Section late at night. Following the murder, community members and civic groups called for visible policing and better infrastructure.These calls have been renewed following the murder of four-year-old Iyapha Yamile, who also lived in the SST informal settlement.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
