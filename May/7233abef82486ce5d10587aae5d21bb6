Reports quote from an email circulated from Tony Gupta to an employee, then to Duduzane Zuma, in which a draft letter to UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed is prepared. JOHANNESBURG The Sunday Times and the City Press newspapers are reporting that emails between members of the Gupta family and their employees show that President Jacob Zuma was seeking alternative residency in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).They also say the emails detail exactly how the Guptas paid for trips for people like Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and former acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko.The news comes as the ANC's national executive committee is meeting this weekend in Irene.Both newspapers quote from an email circulated from Tony Gupta to an employee and then to Duduzane Zuma, in which a draft letter to UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed is prepared.In that letter, Duduzane writes that he requests guidance and direction for making the UAE his second home.The presidency has responded saying Duduzane s only home is Nkandla.Other emails in the reports show how the family had their staff coach Zwane on how to answer questions from the media and received confidential Cabinet information from then Communications Minister Faith Muthambi.Other communications also suggest that Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen lied when he said he'd paid for his own trip to Dubai in December 2015 and in fact the Guptas had paid for it.
