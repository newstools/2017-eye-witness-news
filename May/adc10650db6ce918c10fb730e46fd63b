There was by no means an irresponsible decision taken by the premier.&quot;Thomas-Abrahams adds that the premier respects the ANC's practices and any concerns will be resolved soon.The party's Northern Cape executive committee plans to meet Lucas during or after the conference to discuss the matter.
