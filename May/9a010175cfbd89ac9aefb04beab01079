The PSA&#8217;s Ivan Fredericks says they&#8217;ve joined Fedusa because it is non-partisan. JOHANNESBURG - Just weeks ahead of wage negotiations, the Public Servants Association (PSA) has formally announced it's re-joining the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa). The association made the announcement at a briefing in Pretoria. The move increases the Fedusa s membership to over 700,000. The PSA s Ivan Fredericks says they ve joined Fedusa because it is non-partisan. We are independent, free of political influence and so we are going to pull back no punches when it comes to this year s negotiations. Fedusa s Dennis George says this development has strengthened the federation. With the arrival of the PSA, Fedusa has now grown into a big family with more than 700,000 non-partisanship members. Public service salary negotiations are scheduled to start in a few weeks time. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
