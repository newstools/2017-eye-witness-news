McMaster, reassured his South Korean counterpart, Kim Kwan-jin, that the US alliance with South Korea was its top priority in the Asia-Pacific region, the South s presidential office said.The conversation followed another North Korean missile test-launch on Saturday which Washington and Seoul said was unsuccessful, but which drew widespread international condemnation.Trump, asked about his message to North Korea after the latest missile test, told reporters: You ll soon find out, but did not elaborate on what the US response would be.Trump stepped up his outreach to allies in Asia over the weekend to discuss the North Korean nuclear threat and make sure all are on the same page if action is needed, a top White House official said.The president spoke on Sunday to Thailand Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads a military government that took power in a 2014 coup, and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and invited both of them to Washington.

Video provided by villagers showed protesters blocking the road with a car and chanting slogans such as Don t lie to us! Go back to your country!
