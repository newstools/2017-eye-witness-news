Last week Cosatu said allowing Jacob Zuma to address its activities is inconsistent with the decision it took to call on him to step down. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says the NEC will not discuss Cosatu's decision to bar President Jacob Zuma from its activities.Mantashe briefed the media earlier on Saturday about the NEC meeting currently underway at the Saint George's Hotel in Pretoria.Last week the labour federation took the decision about the president, saying allowing him to address its activities is inconsistent with the decision it took to call on the president to step down.Mantashe says they don't spend their time discussing the party's allies. Cosatu is an independent partner of the ANC; we don t take their agenda and bring it here and debate it. I know that many of the allies spend a lot of time discussing the ANC, but here it s the opposite, we don t spend time discussing the allies. We talk to them in as far as they relate to us. The secretary general also says while the unburdening report by the South African Council of Churches (SACC) is not on the agenda for the NEC meeting, party leaders may refer to it.Last week the SACC released the unburdening report which reveals an inappropriate control of the state by people close to President Zuma.Mantashe says the NEC will receive a report from the NWC, the same structure that resolved three of the top six leaders of the ANC shouldn't have publicly disagreed with the president about his Cabinet reshuffle.He says the NEC meeting will discuss all the current issues. Every issue that is under discussion will be in this NEC, we ll be dealing with the question of femicide as a standalone item so that we come up with a programme on it. He says the report by the SACC is not on the agenda. It is posted on their website; we ve downloaded it but it is not an item for discussion. We re referring to it in discussing issues and it would have been an item on the agenda if the SACC gave it to us.&quot; Mantashe says the NEC will also deal with preparations for policy conference and road map to the national conference.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
