While only R52 million was recovered this financial year, Andy Mothibi says the unit has set a R200 millon target for recovery in the new financial year. CAPE TOWN Parliament's Justice Committee says it's concerned that the Special Investigating Unit (SUI) is not recovering enough money from its investigations.In the last financial year, only R52 million was recovered. But SIU head Andy Mothibi says there are many factors influencing the low recovery rate, including appeals by the Assets Forfeiture Unit.Parliament's Justice Committee says it wants to help the SIU bolster its abilities to conduct more investigations and recover more money. SIU head Andy Mothibi says the unit has set a R200 million target for recovery from investigations in the new financial year. Part of what we have to drive hard is to drive the money lost from the state. Mothibi says appeals by the Asset Forfeiture Unit have affected the recovery of at least R300 million over the past year. He is now working to have the SIU's appeals tribunal re-established after it became defunct years ago, to speed up the conclusion of investigations.
