Gigaba&#8217;s spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete says some appointments credited to the minister in the report were not made by him. JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says while he notes the claims made in the South African Council of Churches (SACC)'s state capture report - he disagrees with some of its conclusions. Last week the report compiled by the council and a group of academics said Gigaba had played a key role in setting up what it claims is a network of people centred around the Zuma and Gupta families. The document said Gigaba had made certain appointments to the boards of parastatals that allowed for looting to take place. But Gigaba's spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete says some of these conclusions are wrong. Some of the appointments that are credited to him were not appointed by him. And for an exercise that claims to be academic, that is something that s easy to verify just by going through google. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
