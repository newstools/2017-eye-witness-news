Defence advocate Pieter Botha has referred to a security report, flagging pedestrian access to the estate &amp; inadequate CCTV cameras. CAPE TOWN - The defence for family axe murder accused Henri van Breda is continuing to question the effectiveness of security at the De Zalze Estate, where the murders took place more than two years ago.The 22-year-old is currently on trial in the Western Cape High Court in connection with the murders of his parents and older brother and the attempted murder of his younger sister.Van Breda, however, claims an axe-wielding man attacked his family in January 2015.Defence advocate Pieter Botha has referred to a security report from 2012.He has told the court that problematic security areas identified in the report had not been addressed by the time Marcia Rossouw took over as security manager in 2014.Some of the concerns flagged in the report include pedestrian access to the estate, inadequate CCTV cameras at the electric fence and access through digging at the fence.Botha says extra cameras were only put in place after the van Breda axe murders.Rossouw has testified several security upgrades were planned when she took over.The renovations to the security system were implemented in 2014 and 2015.
