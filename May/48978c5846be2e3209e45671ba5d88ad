He s got practically no immune system. So going out, malls, play areas, doing fun things is on a stop. Because any germ, he gets admitted [to the hospital] for a cold, he needs to go to the hospital. Palm says they have been unable to find a bone marrow donor in South Africa.A transplant is her son's only chance of survival.Her medical aid won't cover an investigation for international donors, which is why she's turned to online crowd-funding. The hundred thousand on the Backabuddy [website] is just the start to the campaign. Palm has also urged people to become bone marrow donors.
