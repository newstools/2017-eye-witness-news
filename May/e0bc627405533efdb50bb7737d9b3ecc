From next year the festival won’t allow any films that aren’t released cinematically to compete. NEW YORK – Tilda Swinton has weighed in on the controversy around Netflix and the future of cinema at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. Swinton stars in Okja, one of two films in competition that are produced by the streaming platform and won’t be released on the big screen. From next year the festival won’t allow any films that aren’t released cinematically to compete. It’s the big issue being talked about at Cannes. At the start jury president Pedro Almodovar had said it would be a shame if the film that won Cannes biggest prize was not seen on a cinema screen. Netfix is only releasing its film on its online platform. Tilda Swinton says Netflix allowed the film’s director, Bong Joon Ho, to make Okja exactly the way he envisioned it. “We shouldn’t actually come here for prizes. We have come here to show this film to Cannes Film Festival and the people gathered here from all over the world.” Okja, which premieres on Friday night, also stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Paul Dano.
