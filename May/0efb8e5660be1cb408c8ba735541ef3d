Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana says people who are not members of the ANC have valid information to share. JOHANNESBURG The South African Council of Churches (SACC) says it wants to assist citizens who have information about state corruption by not only referring them to the right organisations but also ensuring that their voices are heard.On Thursday, the organisation released its so-called &quot;unburdening report&quot; which reveals damning information from current and former government employees on how the state has been captured by private individuals.The council says it s uncovered a lot of corruption.Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana says they had asked the ANC to deal with these allegations but many people who are not members of the party have valid information to share. We are happy for people to come to us and open up for people who are not members of the ANC. Mr Mantashe said he would be happy to receive anyone who wants to give him information, which is why we will direct people to institutions of state like the Human Rights Commissions. Meanwhile, the council's Frank Chikane says the panel has provided a safe haven for anyone with information on state capture. Lots of people came to talk to them and to give information.
