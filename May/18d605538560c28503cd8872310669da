Award-winning journalist and author of 'The Republic of Gupta', Pieter-Louis Myburgh shares his insights. Listen closely to the story of the rise and rise of the Gupta family (at our expense). Author @PLMyburgh is my guest now @Radio702 @CapeTalk pic.twitter.com/M0xbvhv5ifThe Waterkloof Gupta scandal may have sparked what is now national interest into the families dealings with the state, but looking closely at their history and their initial business pursuits in South Africa, Pieter-Louis Myburgh shares how their prominence did not necessarily begin under President Jacob Zuma's tenure. In conversation with Eusebius McKaiser, Myburgh details the families business history and how they managed to expand.Myburgh explains how the family's earliest attempts at business in South Africa began with Athul Gupta selling shoes from the back of a car.Athul then recognised a gap in the ICT sector, which is how Sahara Computers was born.The family was accused of piggy-backing on the name of an already existing company in India. He highlights some of the politicians associated with the family since their arrival, including their relationship with President Jacob Zuma and a possible link to Essop Pahad who served under former President Thabo Mbeki's ministry. The former president said, rightly or wrongly, Pahad thought Ajay Gupta had the skills and knowledge to serve on the board of what was then the International Marketing Council.
