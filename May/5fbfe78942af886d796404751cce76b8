Highlands Park currently the anchor the log on 22 points from 26 games and because of their poor form, they ve fired coach Gordon Igesund.Baroka are just above them on 23 points, while Free State Stars, Bloemfontein Celtic, and Platinum Stars are all just one, two and three points from danger.The fight for survival is also likely to go down to the wire, as will the race for top eight.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
