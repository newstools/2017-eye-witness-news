Eskom employee Thembisile Yende had been missing for nearly two weeks when her body was found at the Springs substation. JOHANNESBURG – Thembisile Yende, an Eskom employee who went missing almost two weeks ago, has been found dead at the utility’s substation in Springs on the East Rand. Yende was last seen leaving for work. Her relatives say after opening a missing person's case, they learnt that her work car was parked at the substation – suggesting she did arrive at work on the morning she disappeared.  Family spokesperson Mboneni Yende says they tried to trace her movements at the substation, but have been told CCTV surveillance system was switched off that day. Yende says the family is still shocked and they want answers from Eskom. “The sad part is that on Thursday we went there, there were three workers that were inside the station working. On that day, it had been 10 days since had been missing. Are you telling me that if someone has been dead for 10 days then you can’t smell anything? That is highly impossible. The people who were there knew what they were doing.” (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
