LOS ANGELES - Mel 'B' Brown spent her birthday with her estranged mother. The former Spice Girls singer hadn't spoke to Andrea Brown for several years as she didn't approve of her marriage to Stephen Belafonte, but shortly before she split from the producer in March, it emerged they had reconnected. In her first social media post since splitting from her husband, Mel took to Instagram on her 42nd birthday on Monday to share a picture of herself and Andrea, along with her three children, Phoenix, 18, Angel, 10, and five-year-old Madison, and pay tribute to her late father Martin, who died of cancer in March. On the Instagram post, the singer wrote: "My eyes are closed but I see and feel you dad, you are missed every second of every day me my mum my 3 daughters today celebrated you for being the most important man in our lives #restinpeacedaddy (sic) My eyes are closed but I see and feel you dad,you are missed every second of everyday me my mum my 3 daughters today celebrated you for being the most important man in our lives #restinpeacedaddy A post shared by Mel B (@officialmelb) on May 29, 2017 at 10:14pm PDT  After Mel and Stephen split, the America's Got Talent judge admitted she was relieved.
