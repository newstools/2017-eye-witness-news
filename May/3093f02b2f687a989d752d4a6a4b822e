The ANC NEC says it's adopted the proposal that was tabled during Jacob Zuma's political report for the judicial inquiry into state capture. JOHANNESBURG - The NEC has said that the inquiry into state capture should begin without delay.On Sunday, President Jacob Zuma survived a motion of no-confidence brought against him at the NEC meeting.The African National Congress (ANC)'s NEC says it's adopted the proposal that was tabled during President Zuma's political report for the judicial inquiry into state capture.ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says the terms of reference must be broad to investigate whether business is influencing government.On Sunday, the e-mails between members of the Gupta family, their employees and Duduzane Zuma appeared to show how the family was able to direct Cabinet ministers.Mantashe says it wants this judicial commission to look at all aspects of state capture. What we re interested in, is not only to justify the findings of the state of capture report as a reported by the Public Protector, is to understand the depth of the involvement of business in influencing government. That appears to mean this inquiry would not focus just on the Gupta family.The ANC's NEC also says Brian Molefe must leave Eskom now and not wait for the court cases challenging his reappointment, but they won't dictate what exactly public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown must do.WATCH: ANC outlines NEC meeting outcomes
