Wearing a leather jacket and with his fist in the air, Assange described the decision as a victory. LONDON - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says he feels vindicated after rape charges were dropped against him, describing what happened as a terrible injustice . With no prospect of bringing him to trial, Swedish prosecutors announced they were abandoning their rape investigation. Wearing a leather jacket and with his fist in the air, Assange described the decision as a victory.He spoke on the balcony of Equador's London Embassy, where he has lived for five years. While today was proper victory, it s far from over. The proper war is just commencing. Assange has always maintained his innocence, saying his real fight is to avoid being extradited to America to stand trial for leaking state secrets. He says his lawyers will now seek clarity around any possible extradition from authorities in the United States and in Britain, where he still faces arrest for a lesser crime.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
