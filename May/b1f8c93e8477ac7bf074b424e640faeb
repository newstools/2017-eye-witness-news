Matthews Phosa says he does not intend to sue Mabuza because that would be stooping to the Mpumalanga premier's level. JOHANNESBURG Former African National Congress (ANC) treasurer general Matthews Phosa says he has better things to do with his time and will not entertain liars and negative personalities such as Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza.Yesterday, the High Court in Pretoria dismissed Mabuza's defamation case against Phosa.Mabuza's allegation stems from a so-called spy report in which it s alleged he operated as a spy for the apartheid regime.Phosa came into possession of the report when his cook handed it to him, and the former Mpumalanga premier handed it to ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte.He says he does not intend to sue Mabuza because that would be stooping to the Mpumalanga premier's level. I m a businessman and I value my business and time. Phosa says he always knew his name would be cleared and that Mabuza's lies would be exposed. Justice has prevailed and I knew all along that I was innocent and that Mabuza was lying. A former employee of Phosa, Jan Venter, alleged that he overheard a conversation in which Phosa concocted the spy allegations.However, in his judgement, yesterday Judge Bill Prinsloo rejected Venter as an &quot;extremely poor witness&quot;.
