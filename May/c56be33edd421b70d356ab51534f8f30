CAPE TOWN South African Rugby president Marc Alexander says if South Africa was to host the World Cup in 2023, it would be the cheapest and biggest tournament ever.The federation on Tuesday delivered its final bid documents to the world rugby headquarters in Ireland.Unlike other mega-sporting events, South Africa would profit from hosting the tournament as the country already has the required infrastructure.Alexander is confident ticket sales will go well if South Africa hosts the sporting showcase. This will be the biggest World Cup ever with 2.9 million seats. In England, they sold 2.5 million (tickets) and Ireland has about 2.3 million seats. Jurie Roux, CEO of SA Rugby and His Excellency Mr Ahlangene Cyprian Sigcau, the South African Ambassador to Ireland, handed in the 827-page, 8.2kg document, detailing the country s case to host the tournament.It took 24 months of planning but Roux believes their bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup is more comprehensive than the competition after delivering their final bid documents ahead of their deadline on Wednesday.SA Rugby hope that the combination of infrastructure, economy and the climate of the nation make it the ideal location for travelling rugby fans.Working in the country s favour is a proven track record of staging world class events. Alongside England, South Africa is the only nation to host the rugby, cricket and soccer World Cup tournaments.South Africa is up against Ireland and France for the hosting rights, with the winner to be announced on 15 November.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
