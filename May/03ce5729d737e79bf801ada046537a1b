It's believed the discolouration was caused by mud and ash that washed into the dam following flash floods. CAPE TOWN - The Oudtshoorn Municipality says the town's water is now safe for drinking. Concerns arose last month when discolouration was discovered in the Little Karoo town's water supply. It's believed it was caused by mud and ash that washed into the dam following flash floods. Results from the second round of tests this week cleared the water at the Koos Raubenheimer dam of any bad bacteria. Municipal spokesperson Ntobeko Mangqwengwe said: Residents of the Greater Oudtshoorn can now use the water for human consumption and we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the residents for their patience during the past two weeks.
