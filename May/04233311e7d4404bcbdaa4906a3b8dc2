The little girl was rushed to a local hospital at the weekend where she was declared dead. CAPE TOWN - A Khayelitsha father accused of the rape and murder of his two-year-old daughter is expected to appear in court on Tuesday morning. The little girl was rushed to a local hospital at the weekend where she was declared dead. She'd been in the care of her father who police say had recently been released from prison. The Khayelitsha Development Forum says moral decay of society is to blame for a spike in violence against children in the community. The forum's Ndithini Tyhido says: ““This can’t just be said to be a matter of crime. This is more than that and an issue of morality. What makes a father even think of raping his own child?” Meanwhile, a memorial service will be held for murdered four-year-old Iyapha Yamile. The child's body was found last Monday after she'd been reported missing. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
