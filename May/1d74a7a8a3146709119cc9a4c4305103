ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu says public funding is too little for party activities. CAPE TOWN The African National Congress (ANC) is calling for the regulation of donor funding to political parties following years of calls and court battles from advocacy groups for them to do so.The party will be tabling a motion in Parliament soon for an ad hoc committee to be established to determine whether state funding is sufficient.The 13 political parties represented in Parliament share R150 million between them.ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu says public funding is too little for party activities.He says that best practice dictates that democracy is funded from the public purse. The state must come to the party, otherwise, other people might come to the party and derail your democracy. Mthembu says undisclosed donor funding fuels perceptions of corruption. When you don't know who funds who, you might not know as a citizen, who is influencing who adversely. In 2015, a group called My Vote Counts lost a Constitutional Court bid to force political parties to disclose their funding sources.Mthembu says the ANC has always been in favour of this.
