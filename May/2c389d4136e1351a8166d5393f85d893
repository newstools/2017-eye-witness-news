SWITZERLAND - Elina Svitolina won the women's singles at the Italian Open final to claim her fourth title of the season on Sunday after her opponent Simona Halep sunk without trace in the final set.Svitolina's 4-6 7-5 6-1 victory meant she added the Rome crown to the ones she took in Taipei, Dubai and Istanbul.Halep, who won in Madrid last week, took the first set and, although she rolled her right ankle at one point, the Romanian appeared to be coasting towards a win when she broke in the opening game of the second.But Svitolina forced her way back into the match, as she hit back to take a 3-1 lead and held off several fightbacks from Halep to level the match in the 12th game.Svitolina raced to a 5-0 lead in the final set before completing a Tour-leading 31st match win this year.Elina Svitolina shows her happiness to the photographers while holding her trophy on the #ibi17 red clay! #WTA pic.twitter.com/qOS3QqXYOZ
