Eyewitness News understands Zuma survived the motion of no confidence tabled against him after it dominated this weekend&#8217;s NEC gathering. JOHANNESBURG President Jacob Zuma has survived yet another attempt by his party s national executive committee (NEC) to unseat him from power.Eyewitness News understands that Zuma survived the motion of no confidence tabled against him after it dominated this weekend s NEC gathering.The meeting followed growing calls for the president to step down after his controversial Cabinet reshuffle in April which resulted in two ratings agencies downgrading the country to junk status.The ANC is expected to announce the outcome of its NEC meeting at a briefing later on Monday.The debate on the motion of no confidence in Zuma is being described by some NEC members as tense.Three sources in the NEC have told Eyewitness News that out of the 72 NEC members, 18 supported the motion while 54 were against.It s understood that those who were for the motion used the party s dismal performance in last year s local government elections, ongoing allegations of state capture involving the Gupta family and calls by the party s alliance partners and stalwarts for the president to step down, to bolster their argument.Those supporting the president are said to have told the gathering that Zuma can t be blamed for the ANC S poor showing at the polls as the party has taken collective responsibility for the results.They also branded state capture revelations contained in the Sunday newspapers as lies and propaganda.Sources say a 10-member committee that was suggested by anti-Zuma supporters to come up with proposals on how to deal with the call for Zuma to step down, didn t gain traction.MORE DETAILS EMERGEAs Zuma has survived another bid to unseat him in the ANC s NEC, more details are emerging about the emails that appear to show how the Gupta family were directing ministers, while Zuma has denied considering moving to the UAE.The ANC s NEC meeting finished late last night, with Zuma delivering a closing address in which he told his critics, those who want him out are sponsored by foreign forces and warned them to stop attacking him in public.Zuma has survived again and it s understood he hit back at his critics when he delivered a closing address last night.We re expecting the ANC to give a formal report back on this meeting on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, Zuma himself is speaking to a group of traditional leaders in Ekurhuleni this morning.On Sunday, at around lunchtime, the lawyer for the Gupta family Gert van der Merwe gave their first response - saying they consider these reports fake news.He then asked for the emails and for the source of the emails, so that he can conduct his own investigation. Of course if I get it my way, I ll get the documents and I ll be in a position to respond but it s also well-timed don t you think? Then at around 10pm on Sunday night came the statement from Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen.These emails show how he was flown to Dubai in a jet by the Gupta family, he has always claimed that he paid for that trip himself and only stayed in Dubai for a one-day holiday.Van Rooyen now says these emails are part of a court challenge to the Public Protector's state capture report and he won t comment because he believes they are sub-judice.But former ANC Member of Parliament Vytie Mentor has also given her response after she told of how the Guptas offered her a Cabinet position in Saxonwold, while Zuma was on the property.She says these emails prove she was right. Every single fact you see tabled on the Sunday Times and the City Press was revealed by me to the Public Protestor and to the Hawks. The Hawks did nothing about it. At least the Public Protector came out with a report. There s also more information coming from these emails this morning, with The Times reporting that Duduzane Zuma worked with the British PR firm Bell Pottinger to try and smear former deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas when he turned down the offer of a R600 million bribe.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
