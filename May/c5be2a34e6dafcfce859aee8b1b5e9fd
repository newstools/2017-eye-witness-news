With the two goals coming late in the second, the draw sees Amakhosi remain fourth on the league table with 47 points. JOHANNESBURG Kaizer Chiefs squandered an opportunity to close the gap on log leaders Wits after Golden Arrows came back to hold them to a 1-1 stalemate in an Absa Premiership match at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday night.With the two goals coming late in the second, the draw sees Amakhosi remain fourth on the league table with 47 points.Amakhosi found it difficult to unlock the Arrows defence and the two Chiefs strikers Gustavo Paez and Bernard Parker needed more support to push forward and score goals for the Amakhosi.Edmore Chirambadare, almost scored in the 29th minute but his shot missed the target as the Arrows defence maintained a strong grip to frustrate Chiefs.Despite Amakhosi putting more pressure on the visitors, Arrows stood firm at the back and the score was 0-0 during the halftime break.Chiefs coach, Steve Komphela, made the first change of the game eight minutes into the second half, pulling out Chirambadare for William Twala to add more attacking options and pace.The Soweto giants came very close to scoring just after the hour-mark when Parker s well-taken cross into the Arrows box was deflected and it almost resulted in an own goal.Chiefs pressure paid off in the 77th minute when substitute Ryan Moon scored with his first touch to beat Arrows keeper to make it 1-0 to his side.Arrows hard work paid off in the dying minutes of the match when another second-half substitute Knox Mutizwa headed home in stoppage time to ensure that Arrows drew 1-1 with Chiefs.Other PSL results:Ajax Cape Town 1-0 Chippa UnitedCape Town City 1-0 Free State Stars (Friday match)SuperSport United 3-2 Polokwane City
