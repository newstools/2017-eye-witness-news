Police Minister Fikile Mbalula paid a surprise visit to the police's 10111 call centre in Midrand on Tuesday afternoon. MIDRAND - As police officers have their hands full with protests in Gauteng and the North West, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has sent a message of encouragement, urging them to remember the important part they play in the country's safety and governance. Mbalula paid a surprise visit to the police's 10111 call centre in Midrand on Tuesday afternoon. There have been many complaints, with some saying the turnaround time is slow or that at times there is no answer at all. Minister Mbalula had the chance to speak to all officers within the Gauteng province, who happened to be in a state vehicle, using a radio system that broadcast his message. This is Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula. To all of those who are on duty, I want to say to you, you are doing a very important job. Eyewitness News managed to track down an officer who heard the minister's message. She says she was on her way to recovering a stolen vehicle in Germiston, when she suddenly heard the minister speak. I'm so proud, even thinking that if I was off, I d come in and work for free. Mbalula says he was there on Tuesday to see exactly what is needed to improve this particular service in the SAPS. #Police the minister answered a cal earlier, from a woman who asked to speak to Sonti.
