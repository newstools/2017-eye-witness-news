The challenges are dangerous and sinister, with users encouraged to kill themselves on the 50th and final day.Social media analyst and MD of Black Box Theory Yavi Madurai - who has been researching the game - warns that its arrival in South Africa is imminent.Sadag s Cathy Chambers says they are aware of this new trend. It is very concerning but I think for a parent, this is the time now where we can really prepare if it does hit the shores if we do start hearing about cases in South Africa. Again, we ve to remember that this is done online, so parents have a little bit of control here to what access they allow their children online.&quot;WATCH: 'Blue Whale' suicide game may hit SA shores soon
