If there can be something used as a unifier for the people of South Africa, it s water saving. It (water) has no substitute. She adds that while municipalities are doing their bit, it's also up to the people of South Africa to adjust their relationship with the precious resource. The City of Cape Town, together with national government, is in the process of providing service providers to start drilling boreholes. Level 4 water restrictions will be implemented next month.The municipality's Xanthea Limberg says water restrictions are going to remain in place for some time to come because it's going to take up to three years for local dams to fully recover, even with average rainfall.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
