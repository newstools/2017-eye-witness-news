The ANC says it hasn&#8217;t received any formal communication from Cosatu about its decision to bar President Zuma from future events. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says it hasn t received any formal communication from Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) about its decision to bar President Jacob Zuma from addressing its activities.The federation made the decision at its special central executive committee meeting.It admitted that allowing the president to address its May Day rally was inconsistent with its position that it neither trusts nor supports his leadership.The president was booed and heckled at the rally in Bloemfontein earlier this month and prevented from addressing workers.ANC spokesperson Zizi Zodwa said: We ve not received any formal communication from Cosatu about such a decision, expect a public statement. This is not how we should relate to one another. We ll wait for the formal communication. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
