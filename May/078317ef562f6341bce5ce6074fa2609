JOHANNESBURG - Former president Kgalema Motlanthe says South Africa s biggest oversight has been the belief that the ethical leadership model of Nelson Mandela would continue into the future. Motlanthe, along with former heads of state FW de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki, kick-started a series of national dialogues in Johannesburg on Friday. The National Foundations Dialogue Initiative is made up of several prolific iconic organisations and is calling on South Africans to address the deep and pervasive crisis facing the country. Motlanthe says at the heart of South Africa s crisis there's a lack of accountability to citizens by those elected to power.Motlanthe says citizens may have let down their guard down when it came to leadership. Our system of democracy was modelled on the central assumptions that the ethically impeccable leadership model represented by then president Nelson Mandela will continue to be a pivot into the future. Mbeki says no person or institution that contravenes the constitution should trump the will of the people. De Klerk says President Jacob Zuma failed to uphold the constitution and a national dialogue will give South Africans an opportunity to stand up and defend democracy.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
