Cyril Ramaphosa said during a speech in Grahamstown that he wanted to apologise to the families for his role in the 2012 killings. JOHANNESBURG - The organisation representing the families of the miners killed by police in Marikana says they will only accept an apology for the killings from Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa if he goes to them and apologises in person. On Sunday, Ramaphosa said during a speech in Grahamstown that he wanted to apologise to the families for his role in the killings in 2012.Ramaphosa had written e-mails to the police minister at the time asking for officers to take action against the striking mineworkers because they had already killed police officers, security guards and other miners.The Socio-Economic Rights Institute's Nomzamo Zondo says the families of the Marikana miners believe the deputy president needs to say sorry in person. No apology can be to them from the media or on a stage in Grahamstown. If someone wants to apologise, they must come and do it personally. And she says while Ramaphosa was not at Marikana on the day of the shootings, he still bears some responsibility. His actions did not speak of a man who had been a boss of mineworkers for a very long time. I think he deserves blame for that. Someone of his stature and history should have known better. Zondo says the families will be willing to hear his apology. The families have actually sought an apology in legal proceedings. So if Ramaphosa, the president or the ministry of police would like to give it to them, the families would receive it. Ramaphosa has indicated he would be willing to take Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's advice and go to Marikana to say sorry in person.The Marikana Commission found that Ramaphosa could not be blamed for what happened and that his e-mails did not lead to more police officers being deployed to the situation before the shootings.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
