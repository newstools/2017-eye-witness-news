JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has expressed concern about the increasing number of assault cases towards teachers by pupils in schools. Twenty-six cases of teachers being physically attacked were reported to the department last year alone. The department says some educators choose not to report cases. The department’s Oupa Bodibe said: ”Where a child is found to have contravened we expel them, but only just expel them, we also take them through diversion programme so that they can understand and be re-educated.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
