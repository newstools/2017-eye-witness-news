PRETORIA - The Democratic Alliance s (DA) case to have President Jacob Zuma hand over the intelligence report he allegedly relied on to sack former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has been postponed until Thursday. The party has approached the High Court in Pretoria in a bid to obtain the document so it can be used in a separate application to have the Cabinet reshuffle reviewed and set aside. Zuma told senior African National Congress officials, after firing Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas at the end of March, that he relied on the so-called intelligence report which accused the pair of conspiring against him. Although it s being heard as an urgent application, the DA s case has been stood down until Thursday because the parties need at least two and a half hours to argue their cases and there are too many matters on the roll today. The party has argued in court papers that it s entitled to study the intelligence report Zuma reportedly relied on to reshuffle his Cabinet. It intends using the record as part of an application to have the reshuffle declared unlawful on the basis of irrationality. The president has, however, pleaded ignorance, saying it s the DA which has made reference to this report, so it is up to the DA to produce it. Zuma further argues that because his decision was executive in nature and not administrative, records related to the decision are protected. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
