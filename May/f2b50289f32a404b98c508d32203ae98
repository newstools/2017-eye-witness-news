JOHANNESBURG As Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba prepares to deliver his first State of the City Address (Soca) on Wednesday, the African National Congress (ANC) says it has low expectations about improvements to the city. Mashaba is expected to outline the gains made by his administration following the loss of the metro by the ANC in last year s local government elections.The last time Johannesburg councillors met under the same roof where Mashaba was expected to address them, it ended in a brawl. While this wasn t the first time tensions flared between the previous administration and the incumbents, Mashaba says he has proof that the meeting was disrupted by ANC councillors. The case is under investigation. At the same time, the ANC s Jolidee Matongo says ANC members will not disrupt Mashaba today. We re very much committed to participate constructively in the State of City Address. He also adds the party has low expectations of the address. All we know is that he has not done much in terms of delivering on the promises he has made. The only thing that he has been championing anti-corruption campaign, which has so far yielded nothing. Matongo says the ANC has accepted its role as the opposition.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
