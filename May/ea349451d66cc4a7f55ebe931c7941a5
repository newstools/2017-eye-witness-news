The High Court in Pretoria ordered the president to hand over all records related to the controversial firing of Pravin Gordhan. PRETORIA - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has argued that President Jacob Zuma s record of the decision to reshuffle his Cabinet will reveal whether or not he relied on an intelligence report, as claimed by several senior African National Congress (ANC) members. The High Court in Pretoria ordered the president to hand over all records related to the controversial firing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. The party intends using the records as part of a separate application to review and set aside Zuma s reshuffle. Judge Bashier Vally ordered President Zuma to hand over records related to the reshuffle within five working days. The records of all documents and electronic records, including correspondence, contracts, memoranda, advice, recommendations, evaluations and reports that relate to the making of a decision which has sought to be reviewed and set aside. The DA s advocate Steven Budlender argued earlier that the record of the decision is critical to the pending review application. Because it will reveal whether the president relied on an intelligence report and that is a matter that is fundamentally relevant to the question of whether the president s decision was rational. Vally is expected to hand down is full judgment on Tuesday.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
