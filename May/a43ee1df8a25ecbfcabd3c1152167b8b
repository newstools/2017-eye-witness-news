Speaking at the World Economic Forum Africa meeting, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba talked up inclusive growth and hardly mentioned radical economic transformation at all. DURBAN Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says South Africa cannot spend money it does not have and that people need to both grow and transform the economy at the same time.He was speaking at the World Economic Forum Africa meeting in Durban on Wednesday night.Gigaba appeared to tread his usual careful line between radical economic transformation and inclusive growth, saying the best way to grow tax revenues was to grow the economy. We need to continue to focus on growing the economy and implementing transformation at the same time, and that s where the issue of whether you call it radical economic transformation or inclusive growth. The issue that we re addressing there is implementing structural reforms in the economy. His predecessor Pravin Gordhan is also here but doesn t appear to be speaking in a formal position.The economy suffered two credit rating downgrades to junk status last month after President Jacob Zuma sacked Gordhan.Since his appointment as Gordhan s successor, Gigaba has vowed to radically transform the economy for the benefit of the black majority, which remains economically marginalised more than two decades after the end of apartheid.The finance minister has repeated his message that he will not change South Africa's spending patterns and will not increase the level of debt.He also says that the only way for the government to properly increase its revenues is to make sure the economy grows strongly.Gigaba talked up inclusive growth and hardly mentioned radical economic transformation at all.The Finance Minister also says it's important to provide policy stability for investors.Earlier on Wednesday, President Zuma also spoke at the event.He said the fact he was booed by Cosatu members at the federation's May Day rally on Monday proves South Africa is not a dictatorship.He also said he's not worried about the political situation and that recent developments show the country's democracy is maturing.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
