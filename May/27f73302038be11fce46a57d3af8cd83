JOHANNESBURG - The Limpopo government says it hopes that schooling in Vuwani will resume after crucial decisions taken by President Jacob Zuma are communicated to the protesting community this weekend. Schools have been shut for more than two weeks now due to anger at the demarcation board, which rejected the community s appeal to revert to their previous municipality.President Zuma met with the king of Vha-Venda Toni Mphephu Ramabulana on Tuesday night. The Limpopo premier's spokesperson Kenny Mathivha says he is pleased that President Zuma has personally been involved in helping to resolve the situation in Vuwani. I believe he s taking the situation seriously, this comes from the interventions by the king of Vha-venda and the premier of the province. Last year, around 30 schools were either burnt or vandalised during demonstrations. Mathivha believes the decisions taken by the president will be well received by the community after it's relayed to them on Sunday.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
