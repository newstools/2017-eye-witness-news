CAPE TOWN - Parliament s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) wants Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to provide details of a panel evaluating the payment of grants. Scopa says it has been closely monitoring South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) s contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) and the processes aimed at securing a new and valid contract. Earlier this year, the Constitutional Court ordered the Auditor-General or a court-ordered institution should jointly oversee the payment of the grants. Scopa has written to the Chief Justice requesting the names and contact details of those appointed to sit on the committee that will evaluate the payment of grants. The panel, together with the Auditor-General, must report to the Constitutional Court on its findings. In a statement, Scopa writes it may want to invite the panel to present its findings.It adds the committee may need the panel to provide information in order to fulfil its oversight function. Scopa says it will continue to hold Sassa and the Social Development Department accountable to ensure the matter is rectified in a manner that is legally sound and ensures the best outcome for the most vulnerable members of society.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
