The DA leader is in the area ahead of crucial by-elections in the hung municipality after Mayor Djorge Malooi resigned. CAPE TOWN Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has vowed that the party will stamp out corruption in Beaufort West to ensure people the Central Karoo town enjoy better service delivery.Maimane visited the town on Saturday, ahead of a crucial by-election in two weeks.He's confident the DA fend off the African National Congress to regain control of the municipality it won from its rival in August last year. The DA-coalition government with the Karoo Democratic Force has since launched several forensic investigations into the previous administration.Maimane says the plan is to ensure the probes continue. We have got to partner with effective law enforcement agencies. The only reason the ANC wants to win this by-election is that if they reclaim the municipality they can stop forensic investigations, because corruption has been happening under their watch. Our job is to make sure that we bring that change so that we can continue that investigation. The municipality's council became hung when DA mayor Djorge Malooi stepped down.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
