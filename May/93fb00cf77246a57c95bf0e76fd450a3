They were unarmed, Ouattara said. An officer with the police in Bouake disputed that version, however. One of the demobilised combatants had a grenade which exploded accidentally, killing three people at the scene and wounded more than 20, said the officer, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the press.
