JOHANNESBURG A number of prolific foundations have come forward saying now is the time to speak up about the national crisis in order to initiate change.The Chief Albert Luthuli, Thabo Mbeki and FW de Klerk foundations, as well as others, have joined forces to create the National Foundations Dialogue Initiative to address a number of negative developments in the country including political governance and the state of the economy.They have arranged a series of national dialogues to give South Africans a platform to discuss critical challenges facing the country. The first is due to take place on Friday in Johannesburg.The Thabo Mbeki Foundation s Max Boqwana says this initiative will give everyone a voice. History, posterity will not only blame those that are responsible for the destruction of our nation and our country, it will also blame those of us that are supposed to know better. If you re part of all these foundations, we re in a position to drive an initiative that has legitimacy. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
