The Eskom board decided to reinstate Brian Molefe, after Minister Lynne Brown questioned a R30 million pension payout. CAPE TOWN - Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown is due to brief Parliament on the controversial reappointment of Brian Molefe as Eskom chief executive on Tuesday.Brown dodged Parliament last week, saying she could not answer their questions because the matter was sub judice. She's to be accompanied by Eskom board chair Ben Ngubane, who along with Molefe was last week facing allegations relating to the sale of the Glencore's Optimum coal mine to the Gupta family. Molefe returned to his Eskom post last Monday; he resigned last year after being cited in the Public Protector's report on state capture.The Eskom board decided to reinstate him after Minister Brown questioned a R30 million pension payout.The Democratic Alliance's (DA) Natasha Mazzone says the party will be expecting full disclosure on Tuesday, including claims by former Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi that Molefe and Ngubane had a hand in helping the Gupta family buy the Optimum mine. I think Ngubane can give us what happened in the board meeting where R30 million was agreed upon as a sum of money to pay to Molefe, and we also want to hear what the state of the coal contracts are at Eskom. The DA wants a full-scale parliamentary inquiry into Eskom.
