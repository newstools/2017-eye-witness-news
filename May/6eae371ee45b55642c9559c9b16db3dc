Jose Mourinho rested first-choice players in Sunday's league defeat by Arsenal and United's hopes of finishing in the top 4 are fading. LONDON - Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho defended his decision to prioritise the Europa League ahead of the semi-final second leg against Celta Vigo on Thursday.Mourinho rested first-choice players in Sunday's 2-0 Premier League defeat by Arsenal and United's hopes of finishing in the top four are fading.They lead Celta 1-0 from the first leg in Spain and victory in the final against Ajax Amsterdam or Olympique Lyonnais would seal a place in next season's Champions League.&quot;The situation is simple -- 17 matches in seven weeks with 16 players is impossible. It was not a gamble, it was a simple decision. A decision based on common sense,&quot; Mourinho told a news conference on Wednesday.United lost several key players to injury in April, including leading striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo.&quot;When we lost these players in a period of seven matches in seven weeks it was the impossible job. It was not a gamble but a consequence of the situation we are in,&quot; Mourinho said.United have never won the Europa League or its predecessor, the UEFA Cup.&quot;To be in the final would be very important to fight for the only trophy the club has never won before,&quot; Mourinho said.&quot;We will do tomorrow what we have done since the start of the season which is to fight hard.&quot;If United fail to win the Europa League and finish outside the Premier League's top four they will not play in Europe's most prestigious club competition for the second season in a row. &quot;If we don't qualify for the Champions League, it's because we're not good enough for the Champions League,&quot; Mourinho said.&quot;We are giving everything we can, the players, myself, everyone that works around here. We are giving everything so, when you give everything, no problem.&quot;&quot;Nobody has more motivation than I have to try and win tomorrow.&quot; United captain Wayne Rooney, the club's record scorer, did play against Arsenal and is fit to face Celta but his future looks uncertain after a frustrating and injury-hit season in which he has scored only seven goals.
