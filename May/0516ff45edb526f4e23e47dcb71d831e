Mbeki says the same situation happened in Zimbabwe, where Zanu PF moved from a liberation movement to ruling by force. JOHANNESBURG - Political analyst Moeletsi Mbeki says the African National Congress (ANC) is losing support, as young people no longer see the party as relevant.He says the same situation happened in Zimbabwe, where Zanu PF moved from a liberation movement to ruling by force.Mbeki says a similar change was seen in this country when the National Party disappeared after South Africans moved their focus and the ANC could be next. It s the reality of the history of Africa. And as I point out, the National Party was only two years younger than the ANC and it has disappeared. Mbeki says voters will in future decide on the party that offers economic stability. The people of South Africa are focused not on liberation issues because that isn't that important, they are focused on economic development. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
