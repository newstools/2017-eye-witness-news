ANC MP Makhosi Khoza says she received threats, allegedly from the ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) member of Parliament Makhosi Khoza says she s written to the party s chief whip after she received threats, allegedly from the ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal.Khoza says the league is furious with her after she posted on Facebook that she would not vote for an immoral leader whose behaviour would damage the ANC.How does one divorce moral conscience from one's political choices and decisions? When truth decomposes duplicity...The league has been calling for Khoza to resign, threatening that it will picket outside her house and every event she attends.She says she is concerned because she has a right to freedom of speech and therefore she should not be subjected to violence when expressing her views.Khoza says she s encouraged by the support she has received from other provinces. I have no security at all and I ve written to the chief whip. I am really worried about my children. I fear for my children s safety. I am in Cape Town and maybe my safety is relatively better than that of my children. I hope the chief whip will discuss this with the Speaker of Parliament, as discussed with me.
