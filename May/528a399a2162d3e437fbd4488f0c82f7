If union leaders have decided that Zuma can&#8217;t address another Cosatu event, that will mean he will not be welcome at the federation&#8217;s central committee that starts next week. JOHANNESBURG The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) is on Tuesday expected to say whether it will allow President Jacob Zuma to ever address any of its events again, while he is still president.On Monday, the trade union federation s Central Executive Committee (CEC) held a special meeting to discuss the fall-out from the May Day rally that saw Zuma being booed by some Cosatu members.Cosatu had already taken a decision that Zuma should resign as president following his recent Cabinet reshuffle.The federation has quoted its national leaders as thanking members of the central executive committee for a robust and frank meeting.If union leaders have decided that Zuma can t address another Cosatu event, that will mean he will not be welcome at the federation s central committee that starts next week.However, that could open the door for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to come instead when Cosatu has already said it wants him to take over from Zuma in December.It would also show the strength of feeling against Zuma within Cosatu s unions.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
