Energy Minister Mmaloko Kubayi insists Eskom has only been given the go-ahead to issue a request for information. CAPE TOWN - Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi says government is not yet at the stage of calling for tenders to buy nuclear power.The minister insists Eskom has only been given the go-ahead to issue a request for information.Last month Eskom confirmed it had asked Treasury for exemptions in the procurement process for the nuclear build programme. During her first appearance before Parliament's portfolio committee on energy earlier on Tuesday, Kubayi said a procurement process would have to get Cabinet's approval first. Chairperson of Parliament's energy portfolio committee Fikile Majola says there's had been a deficit of trust when it comes to government's nuclear energy plans.Opposition Members of Parliament said this was because what Parliament was being told by the department conflicted with other information in the public domain.This includes Eskom's announcement that it was ready to proceed with bids. Kubayi says if Eskom is stepping out of line, she will rein them in. If Eskom goes and does outside what we have agreed as a process, we will have to deal with Eskom. I ve been very clear in terms of our work and how we want to play it. Kubayi says the department will meet with its legal team on Wednesday to discuss the implications of last week's Western Cape High Court ruling which set aside key cooperation agreements and a ministerial determination on nuclear energy.
