A few tips on how to go quad biking at the Induna Adventure, in Hazyview, which offers trails for beginners, intermediate and expert riders. HAZYVIEW - Since the launch of the #WeDoTourism movement by SA Tourism, Eyewitness News has joined in and put Mpumalanga under the spotlight. One of the stops in the province of the rising sun is quad biking - like a pro. Induna Adventures in Hazyview offers trails for beginners, intermediate and expert riders. For the sake of order, the beginners' trail was up first, followed by the intermediate one (we were never ready for the expert trail).

This is not a competition; it's time to be one with nature.
