Khoza said she had been unable to visit her children in Durban because ANCYL&#8217;s eThekwini region had threatened her. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in KwaZulu-Natal says it believes African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Makhosi Khoza has made up threats against her.On Sunday, Khoza said she had been unable to visit her children in Durban because ANCYL s eThekwini region had threatened her and said it would picket outside her house before publishing her residential address on its Facebook page.The league has strongly criticised the MP for saying fellow party MPs should consider voting against the party during the no confidence motion against President Jacob Zuma.Now the league's KZN leader Kwazi Mshengu says she's the one who is not telling the truth. We are of the firm view that she is manufacturing so that she mobilises public sympathy because it s clear that she is not finding joy from the structures of the movement. Comrade Makhosi, in our view, is on a mission of self-adulation. Last week the eThekwini ANCYL leader Thinta Cibane wrote on his Facebook page that the region he led would step up its efforts to encourage Khoza to resign.He then said on Facebook that they would be having pickets outside her house, before giving out her residential address.Mshengu says she is making up these threats after saying she could no longer support President Zuma. We think [this claim] by Comrade Khoza is an exaggeration of the worst view. We want to put it on record that there has never been a threat by any member of the youth league against her.
