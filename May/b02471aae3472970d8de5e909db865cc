CAPE TOWN - A University of the Western Cape (UWC) student body, which calls itself the Central Housing Committee, is demanding the university immediately address issues around student accommodation at the institution.About 30 students are currently occupying an administration block that was partially destroyed in 2016 s student unrest.They say there is insufficient accommodation for students and have complained that talks with the university management have been futile.UWC's Central Housing Committee members claim they are being excluded from the accommodation allocation process at the institution. They feel they are unable to fully represent students' housing needs at the Bellville campus.The committee chairperson Sipheleke Nongqotho demands closer engagement with UWC management on issues of concern.University management, however, says it has had discussions with student bodies.Officials say short and long-term interventions, in collaboration with students, are being implemented to address the housing issue.They say the building has since been declared an unconducive space to be in and says it deemed for refurbishment. UWC spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo reminds student accommodation is a national issue. There is space that s being prepared for approximately 90 students and those who qualify will possibly be assisted in that particular space. In the long term over the next three years, the university has acquired land and buildings in order to increase the number of available spaces for students.
