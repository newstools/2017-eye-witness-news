Opposition parties and civil society organisations will block the entrance to the utility in protest against a decision to reinstate Molefe. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of the People (Cope) says former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe should not bother to report for duty on Monday because he will be prevented from entering Megawatt Park.Opposition parties and civil society organisations will block the entrance to the utility in protest against a decision to reinstate Molefe.They say they will never allow anyone to turn the country into a banana republic.Molefe resigned from Eskom last year after the Public Protector's State of Capture report revealed he had been in constant communication with the Gupta family.Cope spokesperson Dennis Bloem says Molefe will face his league this morning.&quot;We are going to prevent Brian Molefe from entering the gates. We are going to man all the gates and we are going to make sure that Brian Molefe does not enter this place. We don't want to see Brian Molefe near MegaWatt Park because Brian has resigned voluntarily from Eskom.Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) is demanding that Molefe not be allowed to go back to Eskom.The fury expressed by Luthuli House at this move seems unprecedented.This issue could see the ANC, Cosatu and the SACP all demanding that President Jacob Zuma act and order Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown overrule this decision.But it seems unlikely that Eskom's board would have reappointed Brian Molefe without Zuma's approval in some way or form.Meanwhile, Zuma's opponents in the ANC may feel that the party's national executive committee will have to discuss this when it meets in two weeks time.
