Scientists have announced a 'major' new fossil discovery. JOHANNESBURG - Scientists have announced the discovery of a new Homo naledi skeleton, named Neo, and a new chamber in the Rising Star cave system. The chamber has been named Lesedi, and is similar in shape to the Dinaledi chamber in which the first Homo naledi fossils were found. The latest find comes only a year and a half after it was announced that the richest fossil hominin site in Africa had been discovered, and that it contained a new hominin species named Homo naledi. Wits Professor Lee Berger says Homo naledi dates back between 236,000-335,000 years. Watch the announcement of the discovery live:
