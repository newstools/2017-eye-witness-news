Brian Molefe reported for duty at Eskomâ€™s Megawatt Park on Monday morning after being reinstated as CEO. JOHANNESBURG - Brian Molefe has been greeted by hundreds of cheering Eskom employees during an impromptu meeting at the utility's headquarters on Monday morning. Molefe reported for duty ahead of protesters who had vowed to stop him from entering Megawatt Park. On Friday, the Eskom board announced that Molefe had resigned as a Member of Parliament and would return to the company following a dispute about his R30 million pension payout. Hundreds of Eskom employees started singing and dancing in the reception area at Megawatt Park as Molefe addressed them briefly on his first day back as CEO. Molefe resigned last year, saying it was part of good governance after the Public Protector's State of Capture linked him to the Gupta family. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance has lodged papers at the High Court in Pretoria to interdict his reappointment. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
