Kodwa&#8217;s being slammed for his comment after ANN7 claimed his statement on Brian Molefe had not been sanctioned by senior party leaders. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress Youth League says it wants the African National Congress's spokesperson Zizi Kodwa to stop attacking the Gupta-owned television news channel ANN7 because it is the only channel in South Africa giving just and fair coverage.Yesterday Kodwa said the channel was the Fox News of South Africa after it s claimed that his public statement around Eskom CEO Brian Molefe had not been sanctioned by senior party leaders.But ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe appears to have backed Kodwa.He says the coverage of this issue by ANN7 is strange. We are leaders. We are saying we need to discuss. Now they are going with a story that is very very weird. I think they behaved in a very strange way.
