The NPA says the testimonies of some of the women convicted rapist Christian Julies had assaulted helped strengthen the State's case. CAPE TOWN The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the Northern Cape says it hopes the harsh sentencing of a serial rapist will be a deterrent to other would-be offenders.In one of the most severe sentences ever handed down in the Northern Cape High Court, Judge President Frans Kgomo sentenced Christian Julies to seven life terms and an additional 373 years imprisonment. The sentences will run concurrently.Julies was found guilty of 34 charges ranging from rape, attempted rape and assault.NPA spokesperson Phaladi Shuping says he hopes the sentencing will send a message to people harbouring any criminal intentions. The NPA together with the police will deal decisively with would be offenders, we also hope the sentence will give the victims some kind of closure knowing that this guy has been removed from society permanently. Shuping says the testimonies of some of the women Julies had assaulted helped strengthen the State's case.The convicted rapist raped women between the ages of 13 and 23 in various towns in the Northern Cape and North West. He would target those walking in isolated areas, before attacking them.(Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
