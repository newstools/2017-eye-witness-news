JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament says it's shocked and outraged that its Member of Parliament Makhosi Khoza has been threatened, allegedly by members of the youth league of her own party.Khoza said over the weekend that she had not felt it was safe to visit her children at her Durban home after the ANC Youth League's (ANCYL) eThekwini region posted her home address on Facebook.The parliamentary ANC has also said it condemns the hijacking of Deputy Justice Minister Thabang Makwetla on Sunday night.The office of the ANC chief whip's Nonceba Mhlauli said: We would like to ask members of the public who have information about this incident to report it to the police and we also want this matter to be taken very seriously by law enforcement agencies. On Monday, the ANCYL in KwaZulu-Natal said it believed Khoza made up threats against her.The league strongly criticised the MP for saying fellow party MPs should consider voting against the party during the no confidence motion against President Jacob Zuma.The league's KZN leader Kwazi Mshengu said she's the one who is not telling the truth. We are of the firm view that she is manufacturing so that she mobilises public sympathy because it s clear that she is not finding joy from the structures of the movement. Comrade Makhosi, in our view, is on a mission of self-adulation.
