The crowd has grown exponentially as its moves through the city centre, in support of the &#8216;not in my name&#8217; campaign against abuse. PRETORIA - The crowd moving towards the Union Buildings in Pretoria continues to grow as hundreds gather to say no to the abuse against women and children.Organisers of the event say it s time that men speak out. The Saturday march came in the wake of the recent murders of women and children across the country. Kholofelo Masha, a march organiser, says the demonstration is about the active involvement of men in the fight against the abuse of women. For a long time, men have been very quiet. You hear a lady screaming next door, you decide to sleep when you know there is a problem next door. If they shoot us, we ll shoot them and if they fight us, we ll fight them. No man should beat a woman or rape a woman while you re watching. Organisers say it s also up to communities to become spaces where women can reach out to someone if they are being abused.#NotInMyName march to Union Buildings [Video] KS pic.twitter.com/8L2fIpAWmZ#NotInMyName The moving crowd continues to grow as is moves down Madiba Street in PTA.
