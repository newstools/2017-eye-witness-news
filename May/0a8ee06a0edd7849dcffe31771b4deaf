JOHANNESBURG The Gupta family's attorney says he has no mandate to give a comment on their behalf in reaction to President Jacob Zuma s decision to sign the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) Act into law.Zuma put his signature on the bill on Saturday after previously refusing to sign it following an objection from Progressive Professionals Forum head Mzwanele Manyi.The bill had previously flagged R6.8 billion worth of transactions by the Guptas as suspicious.Meanwhile, the Banking Association s executive director Cas Coovadia says it s now up to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to create regulations to implement the act.&quot;We all obviously need to act to put regulations into place to implement the act and we would urge Minister Gigaba to do that as quickly as possible.&quot;
