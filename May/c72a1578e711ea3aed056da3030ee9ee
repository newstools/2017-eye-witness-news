The Economic Freedom Fighters' Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says South Africa cannot rely on foreign investments. JOHANNESBURG The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it's not shocked by a decision by General Motors (GM) to disinvest in South Africa saying the only solution is for the country to build its own automotive industry.GM will shut down its operations in South Africa from the end of the year as part of its plans of restructuring its international operations to improve overall financial performance.More than 1,000 people are employed at the Chevrolet division and no details have yet been divulged about the fate of the employees.The EFF's Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says South Africa cannot rely on foreign investments. How come we still don t have a locally produced car because this move by GM must force us to invest in locally produced and manufactured automobiles so we can have sovereignty in that industry.
