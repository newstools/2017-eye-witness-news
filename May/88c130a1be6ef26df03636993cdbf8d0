The initiative is especially aimed at women on farms and in townships, where drinking while pregnant is a common occurrence. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Social Development Department has launched a programme in the Hex River Valley area to target the high number of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) cases.The initiative is especially aimed at women on farms and in townships, where officials say drinking while pregnant is a common occurrence. This program follows the success of a pilot project in which 10 young people from the community worked with 50 pregnant women. Out of the group, three women gave birth to babies with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. Provincial social development MEC Albert Fritz says this is a tremendous achievement. I thought this is an excellent programme, let us get 10 other young people to be part of this. We re very excited to launch it. LISTEN: What is your responsibility in the prevention of FASD?
