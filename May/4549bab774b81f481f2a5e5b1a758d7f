Judge Bashier Vally says President Jacob Zuma's lawyers conceded that executive decisions have to be rational. JOHANNESBURG - High Court Judge Bashier Vally says President Jacob Zuma must accept that the execution of his power should meet the test of rationality.Vally has given reasons why he ordered Zuma to explain his Cabinet reshuffle.The president's controversial Cabinet reshuffle, in which he fired former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, saw the country's credit rating being downgraded to junk status by two ratings agencies.Judge Vally has pointed out that Rule 53 does, in fact, enable the review of executive decisions.At the same time, Vally says Zuma's lawyers conceded that executive decisions have to be rational and, therefore, subject to judicial review.Vally also emphasises that Zuma has not dealt with an apparent intelligence report, which he allegedly relied on when making his decision to fire Gordhan.He says without proper information with regards to any documents related to the President's decision-making, the court was forced to order that all records are disclosed.Zuma has two days to submit these documents to explain his Cabinet reshuffle.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
