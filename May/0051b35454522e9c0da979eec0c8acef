Reshall Jimmy burnt to death in a Ford Kuga in December 2015 and his family says the former boss of Ford SA made an offer to settle a week ago. PRETORIA - It's emerged that Ford South Africa offered the family of the man burnt to death in a faulty Ford Kuga a free Ford as compensation, an offer which has been rejected.The offer made last week followed further assertions by the company s former chief executive that Reshall Jimmy had been murdered and that an electrical fault was not the cause of the blaze.Reshall Jimmy burnt to death in December 2015.A nationwide recall of Kugas was initiated earlier this year after at least 50 of the 1.6 litre model variants caught fire.Jimmy s sister Renisha says former Ford South Africa chief executive Jeff Nemeth made an offer to settle at a meeting a week ago and made new claims about his cause of death. Jeff gave us this offer of the car, that they would pay off the claim for Reshall s Kuga that was burnt and he said further evidence has arrived and Reshall was shot in the head. Forensic pathologist David Klatzow says the latest claim by Nemeth, who had at one point claimed Reshall Jimmy committed suicide, is not supported by the post-mortem report. He is dreaming up a version after version designed to take the blame away from Ford. Renisha Jimmy says the family is hoping the new chief executive will initiate talks and propose an acceptable offer.WATCH: Jimmy family briefs on Ford offer over Kuga incident(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
