The court ruled that Jacob Zuma give the DA the record of his decision, which includes a so-called intelligence report. JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has filed for leave to appeal against the High Court ruling, which has ordered him to hand over the documents he used to justify his decision to sack former finance minister Pravin Gordhan.Last week, the court ruled that he give the Democratic Alliance (DA) the record of his decision, which includes a so-called &quot;intelligence report&quot;.Senior African National Congress members confirmed the existence of the document, but in a bizarre twist on Tuesday afternoon, Zuma's lawyers asked the DA to provide the report.The DA's James Selfe says it's bizarre. We are going to resist this vigorously, it is obviously a fruitless delay tactic on the part of the president. The DA had first asked for the report from the Presidency as part of its application to have the decision to sack Gordhan declared legally irrational.
