Professor Lesiba Teffo, political analyst based at UNISA gives an analysis on the ANC's recent shortcomings. Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) held its main May Day rally in Bloemfontein on Workers Day. The event was then cancelled when scuffles broke with some members even booing President Jacob Zuma.Prior to the rally, at least three Cosatu unions had sent a warning message that allowing President Zuma to address Cosatu members would send a confusing message because the federation had taken a resolution that he should step down.Professor Lesiba Teffo, political analyst based at UNISA, said the turnout at Monday's rally is an indication of the people's grievances.Teffo says his sympathy goes out to President Zuma. Teffo goes on to say that the President fails to ask himself what has gone wrong and what he can possibly do to redeem himself. The number of people turning against the President continues to grow daily, he adds, and believes President Zuma's fear of going to jail make him unwilling to concede.

He adds that deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa needs to be brave enough to uphold the traditions of the African National Congress (ANC) to garner his support if he wants to succeed president Zuma.Listen to Professor Lesiba Teffo's full analysis in the audio below: For Professor Lesiba Teffo's interview with John Maytham listen to the audio below:
