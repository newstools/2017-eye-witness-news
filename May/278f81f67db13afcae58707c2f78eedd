The mine says protesters are committing acts of violence, damaging property and intimidating employees. JOHANNESBURG Platinum producer Lonmin said on Thursday community protesters demanding 1,000 jobs were disrupting output, damaging property and intimidating employees around its Marikana operations in the North West.The ructions around Marikana are the latest flare-up on South Africa s restless platinum belt between impoverished communities seeking a bigger slice of the mineral pie and companies grappling with depressed prices and rising costs.Lonmin said production at two shafts had stopped because of the protests and its output losses amounted to around R40 million over seven days, but it could not meet the protesters demands for jobs. These demands are not realistic in the current economic climate and cannot be acceded to without threatening the sustainability of the business, Lonmin said in a statement. Lonmin has recently undergone a restructuring, in close consultation with its recognised union, and significantly reduced its workforce as a result. It simply cannot absorb additional employees at this stage, it said.Marikana, west of Johannesburg, has particular resonance as it was the scene of the August 2012 killing of 34 miners shot dead by police during a violent wildcat strike.
