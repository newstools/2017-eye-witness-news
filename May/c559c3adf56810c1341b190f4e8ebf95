It's said Jongisizwe Dalindyebo had called relatives and told them he was abducted by four armed men. CAPE TOWN - Eastern Cape authorities believe the alleged abduction of AbaThembu king-elect Jongisizwe Dalindyebo was a hoax. Dalindyebo, who is the younger brother of jailed King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, was found with relatives in Mthatha on Saturday morning a day after he was reportedly kidnapped. The Hawks Crime Intelligence and The Dog unit were all dispatched after a case of kidnapping was reported. It's said Jongisizwe Dalindyebo had called relatives and told them he was abducted by four armed men. But Mthatha police spokesperson Mzukisi Fatyela says they re no longer investigating a case of kidnapping. If there's no kidnapping, it means the case that was opened at Madeira police station (Mthatha) was a hoax. There was no kidnapping. From our side, as the police, we are investigating to determine exactly what happened. It's believed this latest saga is linked to the current feud over the AbaThembu nation throne, which has been left vacant since King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo was imprisoned two years ago.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
