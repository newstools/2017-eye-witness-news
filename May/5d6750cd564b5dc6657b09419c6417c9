Nigerian police say eight others were injured when armed herdsman opened fire in a mosque on Saturday. ABUJA Nigerian herdsmen armed with guns killed 20 farmers and injured eight other people in a mosque in the western central Niger state this weekend, police said on Monday.Fighting over land use between semi-nomadic cattle herders and more settled communities, claims hundreds of lives a year in the middle belt and in the north of Nigeria. Last year, the government said preventing attacks was a security priority.Bala Elkana, a spokesman for Niger state police, said the attack happened at about 5am (0400 GMT) on Saturday at Epogi community, in the Mokwa area of the state.&quot;It was a clash between farmers and herders which had been initially handled but some herders felt unsatisfied and ... they launched a reprisal attack on some villagers praying in a mosque,&quot; Elkana said. Three people had been arrested, he said.Nigeria's poor transport and communications infrastructure can slow the speed at which reports of events in some rural communities are passed on.
