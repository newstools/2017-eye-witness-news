The party, along with the ANC and EFF, contested a crucial by-election on Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has retained control of the Beaufort West Municipality.The party, along with the African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters, contested a crucial by-election on Wednesday following the resignation of DA Mayor Djorge Malooi.DA candidate Jeffrey Van der Linde edged out the ANC's Stanley Nkanyezi, receiving nearly 57% of the votes cast in the by-election.This means the DA and the Karoo Democratic Force will continue to govern Beaufort West in a coalition.In an interview this week, the DA's Masizole Mnqasela told Eyewitness News it was important that the town has a clean government. This is something Beaufort West desperately needs. We can no longer subject the people of Beaufort West to the kind of leadership that we ve seen under the ANC, who ignored every rule under the sun. The DA's Magdalene Slabbert has been acting mayor since Djorge Malooi stepped down in March.It's likely this win will open the way for her to be installed on a permanent basis.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
