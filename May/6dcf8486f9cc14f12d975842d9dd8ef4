The report says people are wrong to believe that Zuma is at the centre of a criminal network that has captured the state.The group claims that there is a political project at work to re-purpose state instructions to help a group of networks make money from the government at the expense of the poor.They add the same handful of people and companies connected to what it calls the &quot;Zuma, Gupta family network&quot; are at the centre of this group.They specifically mention the Finance Minister Gigaba and the role they say he played in ensuring that people linked to the Gupta family were given seats on the boards of several state-owned enterprises.The report says that the only way to resolve this crisis is to dismantle the entire network.Read 'Betrayal of the promise: How South Africa is being stolen' below: Betrayal of a Promise FINAL by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
