Brian Molefe to return to EskomThe Eskom board announced on Friday that Molefe has been reinstated to his position as CEO following a dispute about his R30 million pension payout.Molefe resigned last year after the Public Protector's State of Capture report revealed his alleged relationship with the controversial Gupta family.#Eskom Protesters outside Megawatt Park: GN pic.twitter.com/USYgT2eHh2#Eskom wait here they are: GN pic.twitter.com/JhbEXGoMZiThere's been widespread condemnation of the board's decision to offer Molefe his job back, especially after he left the utility under a cloud after his relationship with the Guptas was made public.POLITICAL STORMWith the African National Congress (ANC) joining organised business, labour unions and other parts of society in condemning this move, it appears this could be a test of strength between Luthuli House, the Eskom board and possibly President Jacob Zuma.The ANC has demanded a meeting with Minister Brown and said it will order her to reverse this decision.But Brown may feel she was appointed by Zuma and could be caught in the middle.At the same time, Zuma's opponents in the party may feel that incidents like this mean they have to act now and can't wait until the party's December conference.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
