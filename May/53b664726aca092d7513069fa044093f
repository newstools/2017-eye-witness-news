Pierre van Tonder says the boycott will not only affect franchises financially, but may leave current employees jobless should any of them close. JOHANNESBURG Spur CEO Pierre van Tonder has hit back at Solidarity after the union supported the boycott of the restaurant.Spur has been dealt a major blow following a racial incident at its The Glen restaurant.The Glen Spur management released CCTV footage showing a white man, who threatened a black woman, grabbing the Johannesburg mother's child by the arm.A white male had threatened to hit Lebohang Mabuya after grabbing her son by his hand.Solidarity then called for a boycott of the franchise, saying that Spur misread the white discourse.In an open letter to Solidarity van Tonder says: I would have expected that you, as a trade unionist with influence in the Afrikaans community, would have informed yourself thoroughly before expressing support for a boycott of this kind, especially as this campaign is hurting the very Afrikaans people you claim were hard done by Spur. Van Tonder says the boycott will not only affect franchises financially but may leave current employees jobless should any of them close. In fact, your union Solidarity has members in the franchises against whom you are encouraging a boycott. Their livelihood is at stake now, but instead of acting in workers' best interest He says Solidarity is using recent incidents at different Spur restaurants to serve a political agenda. but instead of acting in workers' best interests, you seem more interested in scoring political points from the hate campaign against Spur orchestrated by Front Nasionaal on social media. A Boycott/Boikot SPUR Steak Ranches Facebook page has been trying to garner support for the boycott and now has over 5,000 people liking it.WATCH: Spur releases CCTV footage of The Glen altercation
