ANC stalwart Frank Chikane says he hopes the NEC will exercise its executive responsibility and resolves issues within the party. African National Congress (ANC) stalwart, Reverend Frank Chikane, says the national executive committee (NEC) must do everything to resolve issues of state capture and leadership problems within the ruling party. Chikane says the NEC is the highest decision-making body in between conferences, therefore has the executive responsibility to turn around the organisation and give confidence to the people that the ANC is the leader of society. On Thursday the ANC stalwarts wrote a formal letter asking the party's formal structure to recall President Jacob Zuma. The ANC's NEC is meeting for the first time on Friday following Cosatu's decision to ban President Jacob Zuma from its central executive committee meetings and events. Chikane says as veterans they are still calling for the consultative conference and believe that it would provide direction for the party. Political analyst, Somadoda Fikeni, says the NEC may discuss calls for the removal of the President, but it does not mean that they will succeed. Fikeni says there is a gradual shift regarding Zuma's future as the President as some members of the NEC have taken a clear position against Zuma and state capture allegations.
