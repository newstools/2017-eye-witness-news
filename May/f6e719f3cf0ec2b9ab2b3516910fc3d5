Ezequiel Lavezzi joined Hebei in February last year in a deal reported to be worth around 10 million euros per season. Ezequiel Lavezzi has issued an apology after a photograph of the Argentina international pulling a face to mimic Chinese characteristics went viral on social media.Lavezzi, who joined Hebei CFFC from Paris St Germain in a multi-million dollar deal last year, was pictured making the gesture while in team uniform, and both the player and the club released statements in an attempt to diffuse the situation.&quot;Per the request of the Chinese Super League, we took the official photos for the season,&quot; Lavezzi said in a statement issued on Sunday.&quot;We were given instructions by the official photographer and I was trying to make some interesting photos by making some funny faces, which would be used afterwards for entertainment purposes.&quot;I had no intention of insulting the Chinese people and did not do it with any bad intentions,&quot; the 32-year-old added.&quot;I'm very happy to be here as part of the Hebei club. I have had great time here with my team mates and it has been a great journey. Every Chinese person around me is friendly and I love my life here.&quot;I deeply apologise if this photo has offended the Chinese public and fans. I will be more careful in the future.&quot;They pay Lavezzi 798,000 a week.

Now we have communicated with him and have clarified he had no bad intentions and he deeply apologised for any offence caused.&quot;As a club, we apologise for our neglect in our work. We will be more careful in the future.&quot;
