Whenever news of our valuable victory is broadcast recently, the Yankees would be very much worried about it and the gangsters of the south Korean puppet army would be dispirited more and more, KCNA quoted Kim as saying. He expressed the conviction that it would make a greater leap forward in this spirit to send bigger gift package to the Yankees in retaliation for American military provocation, KCNA said.U.S. President Donald Trump, in a post on Twitter, portrayed the missile test as an affront to China. North Korea has shown great disrespect for their neighbour, China, by shooting off yet another ballistic missile...but China is trying hard! he wrote.
