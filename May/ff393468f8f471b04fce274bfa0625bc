The board has the task of deciding which films are too sexually explicit for Zimbabweans to watch, but there are fears it will also clamp down on social media. JOHANNESBURG – In Zimbabwe, a new censorship board has been named and President Robert Mugabe’s only daughter Bona has been appointed to the board. The board has the task of deciding which films are too sexually explicit for Zimbabweans to watch, but there are fears it will also clamp down on social media. Bona's appointment has got tongues wagging. She's 27, and as Mugabe’s only daughter, she is unlikely to welcome criticism of her father. The state-run Herald says she’s sitting on a board with 10 others, who include a police spokeswoman and one of Mugabe's close friends, Roman Catholic Priest Fidelis Mukonori. The previous board made news when it imposed a heavily edited version of Fifty Shades of Grey on cinema goers in Zimbabwe in 2015. With elections just a year away, there are worries that the board will be trying to clamp down on social media platforms, where a number of Zimbabweans voice the kind of criticism that definitely isn’t allowed in state media.
