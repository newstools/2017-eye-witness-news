My plea is that the community stands together. SAPS will have to do what they have to do; this is to make arrests. It is high time that police get to the high-flyers. They need to get to the guys giving the orders. The guys running on the ground don t give the orders; it s coming from somewhere else. Several residents have vowed to increase the fight against the scourge of gang violence in their suburb.#ElsiesRiver WC Community Safety MEC Dan Plato urges SAPS to arrest gang bosses.
