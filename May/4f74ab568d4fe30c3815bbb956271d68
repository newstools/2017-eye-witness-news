Mmusi Maimane has called on people who he describes as &quot;good ANC members&quot; to join forces with his party for a coalition government in 2019. JOHANNESBURG Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called on people who he describes as &quot;good ANC members&quot; to join forces with his party for a coalition government in 2019.Maimane addressed da supporters and dignitaries including diplomats in Braamfontein earlier on Tuesday. Just last month, the DA leader told Eyewitness News whatever happens in 2019, the DA will only go into a coalition with the ANC if there is a breakaway faction that will agree with the DA's programme.He also said the party would only work with the EFF if the party was willing to compromise on its radical policies.Maimane has extended a hand of friendship to political leaders in the ANC. There are still good men and women in that party who want the best for South Africa. But first, he says they must agree with the opposition on a number of values. Firstly constitutionalism and inclusive economic growth, non-racialism and zero tolerance for corruption. Last month, former DA leader Helen Zille warned against cosying up with parties that don't share the DA s liberal sensibilities.(Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
