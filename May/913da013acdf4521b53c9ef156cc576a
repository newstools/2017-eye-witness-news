He is believed to have absconded.The rice was donated by the Norwegian Refugee Agency, court officials said.Last month, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered an investigation into corruption allegations against a senior civil servant related to the use of funds intended for handling the humanitarian crisis.The director general of the National Intelligence Agency was suspended after the discovery of more than $43 million in an apartment complex in Lagos in what the presidency described as a related development .Observers have warned for years that the insurgency, which has killed more than 20,000 people, would spill over, but critics say authorities and some aid agencies were slow to address humanitarian issues.
