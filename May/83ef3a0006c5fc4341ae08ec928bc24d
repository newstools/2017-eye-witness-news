Speaking in Parliament, Minister of Water didn&#8217;t directly answer the question as to whether her department had contracts with companies linked to the Guptas. CAPE TOWN Water and Sanitation Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says she s more obsessed with ending the dominance of a few big companies in the water sector than whether her department has any contracts with companies linked to the Guptas.Mokonyane was asked the question during a briefing ahead of her budget vote at Parliament on Friday. Gupta-linked company I m not obsessed with that Mokonyane didn t directly answer the question whether her department has contracts with companies linked to the Gupta family. What I think I am much more obsessed with, it s these companies that have had contracts that have been in the water sector for a period of more than 20 years. Mokonyane says seven big construction companies have dominated the sector some since the Second World War ended in a closed arrangement that in some cases had resulted in massive cost escalations. How do you define the Gupta-linked companies? But I am more worried about those that have been here over time .The minister says nobody s made any noise about the big seven companies.
