DURBAN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu) members in KwaZulu-Natal not to allow the revolution to be compromised just because the African National Congress (ANC) is going through difficult times.The deputy president was speaking at the KwaZulu-Natal Sadtu's gala dinner on Saturday night.Ramaphosa says despite the challenges the country and the ANC are facing, unity within the alliance will ensure success at the polls in 2019.Ramaphosa urged Sadtu members to help restore the ANC to its moral standing. We must not hand over the institutions of our democratic state to those who want to seize them for their own enrichment. He says while there are some who are in denial about the ruling party and its current challenges, now is not the time for alliance partners to pull back. What we cannot do is surrender our revolution to greed, corruption and patronage. The deputy president emphasised radical economic transformation as a necessary process, adding that South Africans should be the true beneficiaries of radical economic transformation. Radical economic transformation is not there to just benefit a few people and selective families. The deputy president adds that it s time to renew the ANC. We can unite the African National Congress, we can unite the alliance, strengthen the party and make sure the ANC is strong for the elections in 2019. The former unionist urged Sadtu members to guard their unity, as having 70% of the teaching workforce as members is no small feat.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
