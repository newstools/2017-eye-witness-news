The province&#8217;s average dam level is at its lowest in decades in what&#8217;s been described as the worst drought since 1904. THEEWATERSKLOOF DAM - Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says the Western Cape government should have declared the province a disaster area sooner.She made the comment while visiting the Theewaterskloof Dam earlier on Thursday.The province s average dam level is at its lowest in decades in what s been described as the worst drought since 1904.The Western Cape Government declared the province as a disaster area last week.Mokonyane had this to say when she was questioned about the announcement. We could ve considered this a while back. And we must commend Mayor Patricia de Lille, other municipalities and Cogta here in the Western Cape who had, whilst the declaration was not made, already put in interventions. She adds they are seeking solutions to ensure water availability for at least the next 10 weeks and are also developing ways to address the situation on a long-term basis.LISTEN: What declaring WC a disaster zone means for residentsDISASTER AREAPremier Helen Zille signed the declaration last week in response to the worst drought the province has experienced since 1904.It's expected to be gazetted later this week.The disaster will be classified for three months and can be extended if necessary.Zille's spokesperson Michael Mpofu said: The province is now empowered by the law to make certain decisions more swiftly, especially if it relates to reprioritising funding that would normally go to the other things, but is now being redirected because there is an urgent need to deal with an impending crisis. It means we are taking greater control of a situation that could potentially go deeper if it is not dealt with in a proper way. Meanwhile, long-term climate forecasts for the Western Cape indicate the region will become drier.EXTRA STAFF TO ADDRESS WATER-RELATED COMPLAINTSThe City of Cape Town has allocated R22 million to employ additional staff to attend to water-related faults and complaints.The municipality and provincial government are scrambling to mitigate the impact of the drought with dam levels having plummeted even further.The city says consumption is 93 million litres above the target of 600 million litres a day.Last week, the Mayoral Committee recommended that council adopts Level 4 water restrictions and implement it in June.Under Level 4 water restrictions, Capetonians will be limited to 100 litres of municipal water use per day.The topping up of pools and irrigation with municipal water are among the restrictions.Car washes will only be exempted from the restrictions if they have implemented water recycling in their operations.The latest data puts dam levels at 21.2% but with the last 10% largely unusable there s effectively only around 11% left.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
