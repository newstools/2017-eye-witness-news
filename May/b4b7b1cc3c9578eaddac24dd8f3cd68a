CAPE TOWN Parliament's legal services have confirmed that the process of identifying witnesses who allegedly lied during an inquiry into the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is well underway, and its final report will be handed in next month.Parliament's legal services held a briefing on Tuesday about the recommendations from ad hoc committee which investigated the public broadcaster's board.In March, Parliament formally adopted the report. It recommended that former Communications Minister Faith Muthambi be referred to the ethics committee for her role in Hlaudi Motsoeneng's rise to power, among other issues.The Democratic Alliance s shadow minister for communications Phumzile van Damme said: There were several people who were deemed to have given evidence that was contradictory; they were Faith Muthambi and the former board chair Ben Ngubane. So those names are out there and it would be up to Parliament to sort out where the contractions are and then recommend for charges to be laid. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
