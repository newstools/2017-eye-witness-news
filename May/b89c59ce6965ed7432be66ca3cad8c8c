The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has responded to the IFP securing a majority win in the by-elections in Nquthu. DURBAN The KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress (ANC) says its loss in Nquthu should not be seen as a direct rejection of the national leadership and President Jacob Zuma.The province has congratulated the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which secured a majority win in yesterday s by-election with 19 council seats.This is in stark contrast with last year s municipal poll which resulted in just a one-seat difference between the IFP and the ANC.KZN ANC spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli says if the residents of Nquthu rejected Zuma they would not have come out in their thousands for the Siyanqoba rally and other ANC events. To apportion the outcome of the elections to the real or imaginary problems and challenges within the ANC would be to constitute a deviation of duty on our part as a leadership. Instead, the ANC says it will analyse all the voting districts and how their candidates were received.
