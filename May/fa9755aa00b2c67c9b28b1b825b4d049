Sdumo Dlamini warned delegates against being used by capital and white people to march, claiming they are pushing an agenda. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) President Sdumo Dlamini has warned delegates at the federation's central committee meeting to be careful not be used by white people or capital to remove a democratically elected government.Dlamini delivered his opening address at the mini congress at the Saint George's Hotel in Pretoria earlier on Monday.There were reports that some unions would table a motion of no confidence in Dlamini, after he attended President Jacob Zuma's birthday celebration and told him supporters wished him well when Cosatu didn't send him to represent the organisation.But last week the federation's central executive committee expressed confidence in the entire leadership of the organisation including Dlamini.When the programme director asked delegates to welcome Dlamini with a song, there was a brief awkward silence and he then had to directly ask the National Union of Mineworkers to start singing.Dlamini warned delegates against being used by capital and white people to march, claiming they are pushing a sophisticated agenda. Because today they are so confident to a point where they now go out and march [these] white people. This narrative is similar to previous statements made by both the president and African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.Dlamini-Zuma told ANC members in April when people marched against the president, it was the first time she had heard of banks closing to allow staff to demonstrate, while the president responded to marches by saying they show racism is still alive in the country.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
