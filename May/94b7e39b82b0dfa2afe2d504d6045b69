The non-governmental organisation has released a report on inequality ahead of the World Economic Forum on Africa. JOHANNESBURG - Oxfam says business and political leaders need to concentrate on reducing levels of inequality if they hope to achieve inclusive growth.The non-governmental organisation has released a report on inequality ahead of the World Economic Forum on Africa which kicks off in Durban, showing that levels of inequality in many African countries are far higher than previously thought.The report shows that seven of the 20 most unequal countries in the world are African, and three billionaires own the same wealth as the poorest half of the population in South Africa.Oxfam's Winnie Byanyima explains: It will not be enough for leaders here to continue looking at growth and how to keep that going. The problem is poverty and inequality. If those issues are not tackled, there will not be the growth they re looking for. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
