JOHANNESBURG National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has told the Constitutional Court through her lawyers that she has no obligation to hold a secret ballot.Advocate Marumo Moerane presented his heads of arguments in the Constitutional Court earlier on Monday representing the speaker in the United Democratic Movement (UDM) case.The UDM wants the court to give parliament the green light to vote in a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma in secret, but Mbete has argued that the rules of Parliament do not provide for a secret ballot.Moerane told the court the speaker is subject to decisions of the house. Our main submission is that the said section doesn t impose such an obligation, the submission only confers powers on the National Assembly to pass the motion of no confidence in the president if the motion is supported by the majority of its members.
