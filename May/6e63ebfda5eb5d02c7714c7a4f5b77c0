Cyril Ramaphosa says the business community, labour and government are actively looking at ways to address the ratings downgrade problem. CAPE TOWN Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says he doesn't want to see South Africa's ratings downgrade turn into a protracted process.A task team has been established to deal with the concerns of lenders.Answering questions in the National Assembly, Ramaphosa said although South Africa is a far more equal society than it's ever been, government still has a major challenge on its hands to grow the economy.The deputy president says the economy is not growing at a pace which will get the country out of its ratings downgrade dilemma soon. So we are basically saying, all of us must look at this as a common problem. It's not a problem of the minister of finance alone or one person alone in government. But he says the business community, labour and government are actively looking at ways to address the problem. What matters now is that we should dig our way out of the hole and make sure we don't get into a downgraded hole again. Ratings agencies are set to visit South Africa again in the coming months.
