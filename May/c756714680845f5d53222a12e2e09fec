The Competition Commission is inviting the public to comment on its probe into the state of competitiveness in the grocery retail sector. CAPE TOWN The Competition Commission is inviting the public to comment on its probe into the general state of competitiveness in the South African grocery retail sector. The general market investigation was launched two years ago. The commission had ruled in 2014 there was insufficient evidence to conclusively prove exclusive leases entered into between large retail shopping centres and retail anchor tenants equates to anti-competitive behaviour.It then decided in 2015 to investigate the general state of anti-competitiveness in the retail market. It also placed the lease agreement issue back under investigation along with other issues.The commission is encouraging specialist retailers like bakeries and biltong shops which have been prevented from operating in malls to raise their concerns.The impact of municipal town planning and by-laws - on the ability of small retailers to enter the market - is among some of the issues forming part of the probe.The public hearings will start in Cape Town tomorrow.
