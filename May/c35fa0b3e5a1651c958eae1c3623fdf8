Workers are demanding a transport allowance of R1,500 up from R350. JOHANNESBURG - Hundreds of protesting Sasol workers have been dispersed with rubber bullets and tear gas at the Ekandustria site outside Bronkhorstspruit. Workers are demanding a transport allowance of R1,500 up from R350.Protest leader Julius Molebatsi says workers became violent when they realised the company is continuing with production, despite an agreement for activities to remain suspended amid authorised demonstrations. He claims Sasol has the capacity to meet their demands and he does not understand why the company is offering only half of the desired sum. It s quite surprising because you have one manager and boss, so why give people different allowances? They are ripping us off and can t say they don t have money. They ve built a $15 billion building in Sandton. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
