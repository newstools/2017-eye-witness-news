Tokyo Sexwale says he's taken recent allegations against the company, which is linked to the Guptas, seriously. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) veteran and former Human Settlements Minister Tokyo Sexwale says he's escalating the investigation into Trillian Capital partners to a judicial inquiry.Sexwale, who is an independent non-executive chairman of the company that is linked to the Guptas, says he's taken recent allegations seriously.He says he asked an advocate to carry out an independent investigation. It became very clear to me that the nobility of my exercises as an independent non-executive chairman to appoint Advocate [Geoff] Budlender is undermined by the fact that he does not have the powers to subpoena either management or any other people out there. Trillian CEO Eric Wood is accused of having knowledge of the president s decision to fire then Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene back in 2015.In an amaBhungane exclusive on Eyewitness News last week, details emerged of how Trillian invoiced Eskom for millions of rands and subsequently helped the Guptas pay for the Optimum coal mine. It's been revealed that Trillian invoiced Eskom for a total of R419 million in 2016, during a time when the controversial family was struggling to come up with the funds to buy Optimum.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown appeared to have misled Parliament about the working relationship between the power utility and Trillian.Amabhungane confirmed that Trillian companies invoiced Eskom a total of R419 million over a period of just nine months last year.Trillian apparently billed the power utility for work done on its corporate plan, management consulting, financial advisory services and management consulting and considering that Trillian formally started operating in March 2016, this equates to an incredible innings of over R1.4 million per day.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
