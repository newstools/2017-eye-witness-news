JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier David Makhura says it s sad that tensions between the tripartite alliance members escalated to such a degree that the official May Day rally in the Free State had to be cancelled. President Jacob Zuma was heckled and booed at the event in Bloemfontein on Monday, with some Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) members calling for his resignation and others defending him.A scuffle broke out and the event was called off after Zuma had already arrived.Makhura says it s the responsibility of the African National Congress (ANC) and its alliance partners to assure South Africans that things will change in the country. He says the ANC has to take note of the calls made by ordinary South Africans in the wake of last month s mass marches calling on Zuma to resign. We as ANC leaders have to take note of that and to do everything in our power to address the concerns of South Africans. Makhura also warned of increasing unhappiness about the current state of the country. He says it's time the ANC looks at how to win back confidence in the party.WATCH: Anti-Zuma protest halts Cosatu s May Day rallyMAY DAY RALLY DISRUPTIONS WASTE OF AN IMPORTANT DAY Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini has said the heckling and disruptions at the main May Day rally in Bloemfontein were an embarrassment and a waste of an important day.It's understood the booing came from members of affiliates the South African Democratic Teachers Union and National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union.There was a lot of resistance from unions last Friday when Cosatu announced it had decided that Zuma would address workers, with leaders saying this would send conflicting messages as the federation had already taken the decision that the president should step down.Dlamini said what happened on Monday should have never happened.Meanwhile, the Free State ANC has said it will analyse video footage to ascertain if its members contributed to the collapse of the gathering.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
