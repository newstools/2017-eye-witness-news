CEO Msibi says there's also too much corruption at licensing and vehicle testing centres which is contributing to the number of reckless drivers on SA roads. CAPE TOWN The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) is looking at scrapping the K53 driver license testing system.The corporation's chief executive Makhosini Msibi told Parliament's Transport Portfolio Committee that it does nothing to shape driver attitude and behaviour.Msibi says there's also too much corruption at licensing and vehicle testing centres which is contributing to the number of reckless drivers on the country's roads.Accidents cost government R149 billion annually.Msibi says the mindset of its drivers needs to change, and the K53 testing system is not achieving this. It's not a good system. It doesn't test the psychological applicability of the individual. He says instead of the 45 minutes it should take to acquire a learner's license, investigations have revealed instances where it's only taking five minutes. It's our view that if we can deal with the fraud and corruption at the DLTCs we have then dealt with 50% of our challenges. Government is hoping to implement its new road safety strategy in all provinces this year, but funding remains a challenge.
