WATCH: Zuma: I reshuffled Cabinet to get more young people in leadership ZUMA WILL BE BOUND BY WHAT HE DISCLOSES The DA says if President Zuma complies with the court order handed down on Thursday he will be held to account for whatever he says or reveals in a later application to review his recent Cabinet reshuffle. Selfe says Zuma will be bound by what he discloses in terms of the High Court order. But the important thing is that whatever reason he provides he will be held to in the subsequent review applications.
