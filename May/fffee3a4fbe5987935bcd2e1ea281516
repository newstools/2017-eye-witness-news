Staff at Eskom's headquarters screamed and cheered as Molefe entered the reception area for an impromptu briefing. JOHANNESBURG Brian Molefe has already held meetings and addressed staff at Eskom on his first day back as CEO while political parties maintain his re-appointment is concerning.On Friday, Eskom's board announced that Molefe would be returning to the company after a dispute about his R30 million rand pension payout.He resigned as the utility's CEO last year, following the release of the Public Protector's State of Capture report which revealed he'd been in constant contact with the Gupta family while they were buying a coal mine that supplies Eskom.Staff at Eskom's headquarters screamed and cheered as Molefe entered the reception area for an impromptu briefing.A small group of protesters who had planned to stop him from reporting for work today demonstrated outside unaware that he had arrived very early on Monday morning.Shadow minister for public enterprises Natasha Mazzone says the protest was symbolic. With a cloud hanging over you such as the State of Capture report, to hold this kind of position you have to be proper. The DA has lodged papers in the High Court in Pretoria to interdict Molefe's re-appointment, while Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has met with the ANC to explain why Molefe was once again offered the top job.
