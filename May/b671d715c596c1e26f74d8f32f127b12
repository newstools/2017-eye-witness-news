JOHANNESBURG Rugby fans have taken a stand against sports blog SupaRugby for perpetuating rape culture. The Lions could receive a visit from the SPCA after raping the Bulls in public in Johannesburg on Saturday evening, the Facebook post read.It was a match report on a game between The Lions and The Bulls. The post was condemned by both men and women, calling out the author for their use of the word rape to describe the defeat. The blog later deleted the post, re-posted it with a different blurb saying: The Lions had Bulls steak for dinner at Emirates Airline Park on Saturday night in one of the best first half performances ever seen at the Park. However, people were having none of that and continued to express dissatisfaction with the blog, which never issued an apology. At the same time, cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro has also been heavily criticised for using rape as a metaphor.Shapiro (Zapiro) s recent cartoon depicts President Jacob Zuma zipping up his pants while one of the Gupta brothers prepares to rape a woman draped in the South African flag.
