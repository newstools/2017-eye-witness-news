In each sub-indices, Africans end up in the bottom compared to Coloured, Indian, Asian and White South Africans. CAPE TOWN - A report by the South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) has revealed Africans exhibit a far poorer quality of life compared to other races in the country. The first Quality of Life Index was released by the institute on Monday and will be updated annually to benchmark South Africa s progress. The index is based on 10 weighted indicators, the matric pass rate, unemployment, people s ability to repay a bond and access to piped water are among the categories. These figures, based on data from Stats SA, the Education Department and the SA Police Service, are then compared between different races and provinces.In each sub-indices, Africans end up in the bottom compared to Coloured, Indian, Asian and White South Africans, giving them the lowest score in the Quality of Life Index. The SAIRR has however admitted the index conceals the significant black middle class , which has emerged and who enjoys similar life qualities as the other races.The SAIRR s Gerbrandt van Heerden says intra-race inequality does not receive sufficient policy attention. Gauteng and the Western Cape shares the top spot for the Best Quality of Life, if not for its high murder rate, the Western Cape would have been the best provincial performer on the index.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
