UDM leader Bantu Holomisa confirmed he'll be holding a meeting with the DA&#8217;s top leaders on Monday. JOHANNESBURG - UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says the project that is underway involving a coalition of his party and the DA in Nelson Mandela Bay is too important to be undermined by two people squabbling over procedures.He's also confirmed he'll be holding a meeting with the DA s top leaders on Monday after the Metro s DA Mayor Athol Trollip this week removed the UDM s deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani from his mayoral committee.Trollip has said Bobani has refused to work with him, objected to the appointment of senior officials and laid charges against people appointed by Trollip.Holomisa says he wants a proper independent investigation into what's happened there. This Bobani is wrong, after this investigation, he will have to pack and go. If Trollip is the cause of this problem both of them will have to leave.(Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
