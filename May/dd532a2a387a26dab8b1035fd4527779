Dozens of countries have been hit by a cyberattack at the weekend. CAPE TOWN - Technology research and strategy organisation World Wide Worx says it's difficult to determine the scope of ransomware attacks as companies are often reluctant to report them.Dozens of countries have been hit by a cyberattack.The software locks down companies IT systems until they pay a ransom to an untraceable account.World Wide Worx's Arthur Goldstuck says one of the ways businesses can prevent such malicious software attacks is by keeping their systems updated. Any organisation that has IT people in charge of their systems and were affected by this one, there was definitely mismanagement and they haven t kept their software up to date. Officials across the globe scrambled over the weekend to catch the culprits behind the massive ransomware worm that disrupted operations at car factories, hospitals, shops and schools, while Microsoft on Sunday pinned blame on the US government for not disclosing more software vulnerabilities.Cybersecurity experts said the spread of the worm dubbed WannaCry - &quot;ransomware&quot; that locked up more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries - had slowed but that the respite might only be brief amid fears new versions of the worm will strike.In a blog post on Sunday, Microsoft President Brad Smith appeared to tacitly acknowledge what researchers had already widely concluded: The ransomware attack leveraged a hacking tool, built by the US National Security Agency, that leaked online in April.He also poured fuel on a long-running debate over how government intelligence services should balance their desire to keep software flaws secret - in order to conduct espionage and cyber warfare - against sharing those flaws with technology companies to better secure the internet.&quot;This attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem,&quot; Smith wrote. He added that governments around the world should &quot;treat this attack as a wake-up call&quot; and &quot;consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.&quot;The NSA and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Microsoft statement.Economic experts offered differing views on how much the attack, and associated computer outages, would cost businesses and governments.The non-profit US Cyber Consequences Unit research institute estimated that total losses would range in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but not exceed $1 billion.Most victims were quickly able to recover infected systems with backups, said the group's chief economist, Scott Borg.US President Donald Trump on Friday night ordered his homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, to convene an &quot;emergency meeting&quot; to assess the threat posed by the global attack, a senior administration official told Reuters.Additional reporting by Reuters.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
