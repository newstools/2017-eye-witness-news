Although they have played fewer games, they really lack a little mental freshness,&quot; he added.&quot;When they are playing, those efforts take their toll.&quot;Federer on Monday said he was pulling out of this month's French Open to avoid playing on clay this season as part of efforts to prolong his career, while Nadal will be bidding for his 10th Roland Garros title.
