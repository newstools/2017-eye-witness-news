Former Tanzania president Jakaya Kikwete says Africa can play a significant role in addressing the potential global education crisis. DURBAN The World Economic Forum (WEF) Africa has heard that bettering the education system in Africa will not only benefit the continent, but could also assist in replenishing the world s skills shortage.That is the outlook of the former Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete who was speaking at the event in Durban on Wednesday.He was speaking in his capacity as special envoy for the Education Commission at the launch of a fund to tackle Africa s education problems.According to the Education Commission, at current education investment trends, more than 800 million of the world s 1.6 billion young people will lack the skills necessary for employment by 2030.Kikwete said Africa could play a significant role in addressing the potential global education crisis.He urged countries to increase their spending on education, but admitted this would still not be enough to solve the problem.The finance facility aims to fill this gap by raising $13 billion through private, public and institutional investments on an annual basis to better education on the continent, something Kikwete said would ultimately support inclusive growth.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
