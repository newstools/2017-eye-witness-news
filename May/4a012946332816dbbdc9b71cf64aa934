Eskom's chief nuclear officer Dave Nicholls has once again stressed that no deal has been signed with any party to deliver nuclear power plants. CAPE TOWN Eskom's chief nuclear officer says there won't be any room for corruption in South Africa's proposed nuclear energy deal.Dave Nicholls spoke on the sidelines of Africa Utility week conference in Cape Town on Thursday.Last month, the Western Cape High Court ruled that government can't proceed with its nuclear power ambitions because of procedural concerns.Nicholls has once again stressed that no deal has been signed with any party to deliver nuclear power plants. We keep saying we have no secrets. People talk about a Russian deal and I have said I don t know what they are talking about. He adds that corruption will be 'challenging' should the programme go ahead. In the sense that it s a state to state deal, there is no middle man involved. If you have multiple deals and small contracts you tend to get options. Nicholls believes that nuclear power is the only option to secure future energy supply because renewable energy still faces obstacles like energy storage.
