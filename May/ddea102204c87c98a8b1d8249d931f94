Three state witnesses have been cross-examined so far as the trial started in the Western Cape High Court two weeks ago. CAPE TOWN The De Zalze Estate s security is expected to be scrutinised even further as triple murder accused Henri van Breda s trial resumes on Monday morning. The 22-year-old Van Breda is accused of killing his parents and older brother and injuring his younger sister at their home outside Stellenbosch in January 2015.Three State witnesses have been cross-examined so far, as the trial started in the Western Cape High Court two weeks ago. The defence last week grilled two security guards who were on duty at the estate on the night of the attacks. Advocate Matthys Combrink is challenging the estate s sophisticated security system to support Van Breda s claim that balaclava-clad intruders had attacked his family.Combrink read a security report detailing the exact times three alarms had been triggered on the night of the triple murders. But Lorenzo Afrika and Edgar Wyngaard, who worked for Thorburn Security, have both stated they had not heard or seen anything out of the ordinary that night.The State is expected to call their next witness, the De Zalze estate security manager, to testify on Monday.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
