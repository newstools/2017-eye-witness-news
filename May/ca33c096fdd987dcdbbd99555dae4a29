The party says it will block the entrance to Eskom headquarters Megawatt Park on Monday after the announcement of Molefe&#8217;s reinstatement. JOHANNESBURG The Congress of the People (Cope) says it plans to block the entrance to Eskom s headquarters, Megawatt Park, on Monday to physically prevent former Chief Executive Officer Brian Molefe from entering the building.Molefe is expected to return to his position following the power utility's decision to reinstate him.The move has been condemned by many political parties, including the African National Congress and the business community.The former CEO resigned from Eskom in 2016 after the public protector's State of Capture report revealed he had been in constant communication with the controversial business family the Guptas, and visited Saxonwold regularly while the family was buying a coal mine that supplied the power utility.Cope says it s in communication with other political parties to join them in this action.Party spokesperson Dennis Bloem says, The time to take action is now; we are very much determined to show Mr Jacob Zuma, the Guptas and Brian Molefe and any other Mickey Mouse that we will never allow anybody to turn our country into a banana republic. At the same time, National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has condemned Eskom s decision to reinstate Molefe.The union says the former had resigned voluntarily.Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim says the union views Molefe s reinstatement as an attempt, by Eskom, to clear the former CEO of the stench of corruption hanging over his headThe union s spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi says, The minister can t advance an iota of morality or ethics while this situation persists. His presence will have a very negative impact and will create the impression that Eskom is not interested in good, clean governance. LISTEN: No joke!
