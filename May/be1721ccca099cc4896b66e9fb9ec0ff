The Lions and Bulls will face off on Saturday in the so-called Jukskei Derby. JOHANNESBURG - Johan Ackermann has made three changes to his Emirates Lions team to face the Bulls on Saturday, bringing in Malcolm Marx, Ruan Dreyer and Jacques van Rooyen.The Bulls have also made three changes, including giving 21-year-old Sibahle Maxwane his debut.Ackermann says the Bulls will pose a real threat with their youngsters.&quot;We always know that the Bulls have enough talent, so regardless of who they play, they are going to be tough, especially if you put some youngsters with those senior guys.&quot;Ackermann says last year's New Zealand tour helped them prepare better for their Australian tour.&quot;Last year was a big learning curve because we played the New Zealand sides away and this year the Australians and the final away, so that definitely helps with knowing what to expect in terms of the travelling and the training fields.Captain Warren Whiteley says no team can be taken lightly.&quot;You can't underestimate anyone in this competition. Anything can happen. As soon as you think you're on the top, a team that is below you on the log can topple you.&quot;But he says there's a positive mood in the team.&quot;The guys are in a good space and have a lot of confidence from the tour. But as we know there's still a lot of work to be done and this is a really important part of the competition, as we learnt from last year.&quot;
