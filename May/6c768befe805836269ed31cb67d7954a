Patrick Wisani was sentenced on Thursday for killing his girlfriend Nosipho Mandleleni in their Yeoville flat in 2015. JOHANNESBURG There has been mixed reaction from civil rights organisations to the 20-year prison sentence handed down to murderer Patrick Wisani.The former African National Congress Youth League leader was sentenced on Thursday for killing his girlfriend, Nosipho Mandleleni, in their Yeoville flat in 2015.He was also convicted of intimidation and assault after he threatened State witnesses while on bail.Maurice Smithers from the Yeoville Bellevue No to Gender Based Violence Coalition says while he believes there were inconstancies in the judgement, they do believe Judge Ismail Mohammed did a fair job. He mentioned another case where a person, after pleading guilty, had been sentenced to 40 years - reduced to 20 and in this case he was been given the same sentence, and he has shown absolutely no remorse. At the same time, Sonke Gender Justice's Nonhlanhla Skosana says the organisation still believes a life sentence should have been the judgment. I think the mother of the deceased wanted a life sentence and we think they have not met her wish. For us what is important is what she wanted. Skosana says the organisation will continue to support Mandleleni's family and help them to find closure.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
