Residents from the Malawi Camp and Freedom Farm informal settlements stoned passing cars and burnt tyres. CAPE TOWN - It's calm in Belhar where violent protests along Robert Sobukwe Road have disrupted traffic this week. Residents from the Malawi Camp and Freedom Farm informal settlements stoned passing cars and burnt tyres. Malawi Camp community leader Muzi Duma says he'll be engaging with community members. Going into the area and maybe some people may have some information, on what is happening? Why were people protesting? People s eyes are always wide open to get houses. The City of Cape Town's JP Smith says the protests stem from false information about residents being moved to the N2 Gateway housing units and having to pay R500. Someone is charging beneficiaries that are getting housing R500 per unit, when in fact they have no right to do so; so whoever is charging them is doing so illegally. They are saying the council is asking them for R500 and we can definitely tell that that is not true. Law enforcement authorities continue to monitor the area.
