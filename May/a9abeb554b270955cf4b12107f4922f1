The Road Traffic Management Corporation says it wants to see traffic officers work similar shifts to police officers. PARLIAMENT - The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) says it wants to finalise the implementation of a 24-hour shift system for traffic officers nationwide, in an attempt to bring down the high death rate on the country's roads.The corporation's chief executive Makhosini Msibi told Parliament's Transport Committee on Friday that there appeared to be reluctance on the part of provincial authorities to introduce round the clock shifts, despite being legally empowered to do so.The RTMC s Msibi says he wants to see traffic officers work similar shifts to police officers, a 12-hour shift for four days and then receive four days off.Msibi says the matter needs to be discussed by the National Bargaining Chamber so that there's consensus on the proposal. Post office hours there s conspicuous absence of traffic officers on the roads. We are talking to the Department of Public Service and Administration to have a 24-hour shift system regulated. The Western Cape has started implementing a round the clock model and Msibi says Mpumalanga will be modelling its system on this by September.It will be followed by the Free State and the other provinces by the end of the year.
