JOHANNESBURG - President Donald Trump has been handing out his cellphone number to world leaders and urging them to call him directly.It s an unusual invitation that breaks diplomatic protocol and is raising concerns about the security and secrecy of the US commander in chief s communications.The Associated Press is reporting that Trump has already urged leaders of Canada and Mexico to reach him on his cellphone.The notion of world leaders calling each other up via cellphone may seem unremarkable in the modern, mobile world, but in the diplomatic arena; where leader-to-leader calls are highly orchestrated affairs; it is another notable breach of protocol for a president who has expressed distrust of official channels.
