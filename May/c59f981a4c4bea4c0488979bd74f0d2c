ANC NEC member Lindiwe Sisulu says the party is at its lowest and says the solution to restore it can be found at the party's elective conference in December. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) NEC Member Lindiwe Sisulu has called for tough action against those who she says are going against the ANC's rules by campaigning for the party's leadership position and adds they must not expect to be recognized as members who are obeying the rules of the party.Sisulu was speaking on the sidelines of the military veterans dialogue at the Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg on Thursday.The ANC Women's L eague (ANCWL) was the first structure of the ANC to go against the party and officially announce Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as their preferred candidate for the position of ANC president.Sisulu has also been touted as a potential candidate for the same position and is also said to be already campaigning.The ANCWL, together with Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma have since been on the campaign trail, with the former AU commission chairperson talking about women leadership and the need for the country to have a female president.Lindiwe Sisulu believes such people are flouting ANC rules. You can t openly flout ANC laws and regulations and still hope that you d be recognised as somebody who s law abiding and upholding the principles of the ANC. Sisulu says the party is at its lowest and says the solution to restore it can be found at the party s elective conference in December. We have to find the solution, it can t get worse than this. The solution has to be found in December. We ve an election to win in 2019. She says the ANC must discuss what to do to with people acting with impunity by campaigning prematurely and take action against them.
