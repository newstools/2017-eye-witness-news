The coalition partners, which include Cope and the ACDP are set for crisis talks soon after Mongameli Bobani of the UDM was removed from the mayoral committee. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) and United Democratic Movement (UDM) are adamant a coalition government in the Nelson Mandela Bay remains intact despite a fallout between the mayor and his deputy.The coalition partners, which also include Congress of the People (Cope) and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) are set for crisis talks soon after deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani of the UDM was removed from the mayoral committee.Athol Trollip removed Bobani on Tuesday after months of conflict in which he allegedly stood in the way of progress. In a letter to the UDM last week, the DA complained about what it described as &quot;erratic behaviour&quot; from the deputy mayor.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says this does not mean the coalition is crumbling. The coalition is intact. We were not drunk when we decided to work as partners. But if people have problems they must follow procedures, and they must also remember that no one was given the power to run a municipality in Port Elizabeth. DA federal council chairperson James Selfe says the party remains committed to the coalition, but without Bobani. It cannot be that our project of good governance and the fight against corruption is imperilled by the activities of one person. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
