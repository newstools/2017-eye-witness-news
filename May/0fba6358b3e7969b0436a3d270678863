Ntlemeza will spend at least another two weeks at home before he gets another chance to argue why he should be permitted to return to work. PRETORIA As Police Minister Fikile Mbalula feels vindicated, Lieutenant-general Berning Ntlemeza will spend at least another two weeks at home before he gets another chance to argue why he should be permitted to return to work, but even that appears unlikely to happen.The High Court in Pretoria not only struck his application from the roll for lack or urgency but reaffirmed that earlier findings of impropriety permanently disqualifies him from serving as head of the Hawks.Last month, a full bench of the court relied on 2015 findings that Ntlemeza lacked integrity and honour to review and set aside his appointment to the top post.Judge Sheila Mphahlele reaffirmed the full bench s finding against the lieutenant-general which limits his chances of ever being head of the Hawks again. The court pointed out that the applicant s dishonesty and lack of integrity permanently disqualified him from being appointed in public office. The judge says Ntlemeza s appeal is set down for 2 June. This will afford the applicant to speedily obtain substantial redress if he s entitled to it. The minister says this ruling confirms his interpretation of the order removing Ntlemeza from office was correct.
