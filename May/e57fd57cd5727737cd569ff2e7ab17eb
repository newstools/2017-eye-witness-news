GENEVA - UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein voiced deep concern on Monday at mass arrests and sackings and renewal of the state of emergency in Turkey, saying terror should not be tackled at the expense of human rights. It is highly unlikely that the suspensions and detentions will have met due process standards, Zeid told a news briefing after the latest round of suspensions of civil servants and arrests of police in Turkey.Regarding the detention of Turkish journalists, Zeid said: Journalism is not a crime in Turkey, it is an issue the government must pay deep attention to. On Saturday Turkey expelled more than 3,900 people from the civil service and military as threats to national security, in the second major purge since President Tayyip Erdogan was granted sweeping new powers.Erdogan won those concessions in a referendum in mid-April, which rights groups and some Western allies believe has brought the country, a Nato-member and European Union candidate, closer to one-man rule.The expulsions - carried out in conjunction with media curbs - affected prison guards, clerks, academics, employees of the religious affairs directorate and 1,200 members of the armed forces including nearly 600 officers.They were fired for suspected links to terrorist organisations and structures presenting a threat to national security , according to a decree in the Official Gazette.On Wednesday more than 9,000 police were suspended and another 1,000 detained for alleged links to the network of the US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for a coup attempt last July in which he has denied all involvement.In all, some 120,000 people have been suspended or sacked from their jobs and more than 40,000 arrested in the aftermath of the failed putsch, which killed 240 people, mostly civilians.The mass detentions were initially supported by many Turks, who supported Erdogan in blaming Gulen.But criticism has mounted as the arrests widened, with relatives of many of those detained or sacked denying their involvement in the coup and calling them victims of a purge.
