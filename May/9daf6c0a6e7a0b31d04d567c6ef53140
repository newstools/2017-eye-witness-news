This comes after the rape of an eight-year-old schoolgirl allegedly by three fellow pupils at a primary school in Randburg last month. JOHANNESBURG/ CAPE TOWN - Teachers union South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu) says it's shocked by the recent scourge of violence against women and children. This comes after the rape of an eight-year-old schoolgirl allegedly by three fellow pupils at a primary school in Randburg last month. Police are also investigating a spate of murders in and around Soweto after the bodies of four women were discovered at the weekend in separate incidents.This week a pregnant woman was also raped in the Johannesburg CBD allegedly by 11 men. Sadtu s Nomusa Cembi says issues including unemployment and drug abuse cannot be used as an excuse to commit crimes against women. We know that people talk about issues of psycho-socio-economic problems but we cannot say that because of these then, therefore, such incidents should take place. Meanwhile, in the Western Cape 19 children have been killed since the start of this year. Provincial police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula has condemned the killings. The level of information - in our fight against crime - that we get is dependent on the cooperation from communities. There s a lot that s been done. However, there s still more to be done to get down to the bottom of this, especially gangsterism. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
