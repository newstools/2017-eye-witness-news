Lawyers defending family axe murder accused Henri van Breda are trying to prove that security is less than idyllic at the De Zalze estate. CAPE TOWN Lawyers defending family axe murder accused Henri van Breda are trying to prove that security is less than idyllic at the De Zalze estate.The 22-year-old is accused of killing his parents, older brother and wounding his younger sister with an axe at their Stellenbosch home in January 2015, but he claims it was an intruder.The defence on Wednesday cross-examined the security officer who was on patrol on the night of the attack. Defence advocate Matthys Combrink cross-examined former De Zalze security officer Lorenzo Afrika on his exact movements around the estate on the night of the triple murder. Combrink probed Afrika on whether he drove in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction to determine whether he may have had any blind spots while on patrol. Afrika said he could not remember the direction, but insisted he checked in at all the mandatory clock-in points. Combrink presented a Thorburn Security company report which states that alarms were triggered three times during the night. The defence team is interrogating which direction the security cameras were facing and what would cause the electric fence to malfunction. Combrink also submitted photographs from 2013 of the fence at the river and where soil erosion caused a trench under the fence.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
