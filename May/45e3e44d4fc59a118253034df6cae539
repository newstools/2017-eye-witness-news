Announcing that she had instructed the board to rescind Brian Molefe&#8217;s reappointment, Minister Lynne Brown said the decision had been a complicated one. PARLIAMENT - Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown says she still has a number of questions to pose to the Eskom board before the matter around Brian Molefe s reinstatement as chief executive officer (CEO) can be laid to rest. Announcing on Wednesday that she had instructed the board to rescind his reappointment, Brown said the decision had been a complicated one.Brown met with board members again on Wednesday afternoon to determine if there are any repercussions from Molefe s short stint back at the helm.If Molefe entered into any agreements as Eskom CEO over the last two weeks, they could now be null and void. But Brown says the extent of his involvement in the day to day running of the parastatal and the ramifications of any decisions he took still needs to be determined. What happens to all the contracts that Mr Molefe signed, that I will know when I meet with the board on Wednesday. And of course, the board might not know the answer either and they will have to report back. It s also not known at this time, whether Molefe will be paid a salary for his time in office.Brown said she would hold off on any action against the board for illegally reinstating Molefe, until after its annual general meeting on 23 June.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
