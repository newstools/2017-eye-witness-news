ANC in KwaZulu-Natal says Cyril Ramaphosa should have informed its officials of his political activities in the province. DURBAN - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa s visit to the Shembe Church and Newcastle without its knowledge shows a tendency that is divisive and introduces a new dangerous culture.The provincial leadership has held a briefing in Durban following its weekend meeting.It says Ramaphosa should have informed ANC officials of his political activities in KwaZulu-Natal and the matter has now been brought to the attention of secretary general Gwede Mantashe. Nearly two weeks ago, the ANC in the province invited the deputy president to join the leadership to campaign in Nquthu ahead of by-elections later this month.But provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli says Ramaphosa s visit to a cadre s forum in Newcastle was not part of the programme. He came here on invitation by the PEC and unfortunately he decided that later in the evening he would be diverted to something that was not known by the leadership of the ANC. The provincial leadership has also dismissed the Newcastle meeting as not being a genuine cadre s forum, but would not be drawn on whether it believes Ramaphosa is on the campaign trail.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
