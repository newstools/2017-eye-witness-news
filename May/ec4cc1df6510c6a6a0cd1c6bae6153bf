Prasa will no longer be embarking on a nationwide strike after unions reached a wage agreement with the parastatal. CAPE TOWN - Workers at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) will no longer be embarking on a nationwide strike after unions reached a wage agreement with the parastatal. South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu), as well as the United National Transport Union (Untu) were prepared to down tools in support of their 10% salary hike demand. Prasa initially offered 7%. The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) has issued a strike certificate earlier this month after the parties failed to reach a settlement during the mediation process. Satawu spokesperson Zanele Sabela says Prasa acting chief executive Lindikhaya Zide intervened as the industrial drew closer. We signed an agreement that says the workers will receive an 8% salary increase and on top of that the management gave us the assurance that in the period that the agreement is valid there wouldn t be any retrenchment.
