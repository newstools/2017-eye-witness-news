The US Air Force dropped a bomb, which was referred to as 'Mother of All Bombs', on suspected IS fighters in eastern Afghanistan LONDON - Pope Francis on Saturday criticised the naming of the US military's biggest non-nuclear explosive as &quot;the Mother of All Bombs&quot;, saying the word &quot;mother&quot; should not be used in reference to a deadly weapon.The US Air Force dropped such a bomb, officially designated as the GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) on suspected Islamic State fighters in eastern Afghanistan last month. The nickname was widely used in briefings and reporting on the attack.&quot;I was ashamed when I heard the name,&quot; Pope Francis told an audience of students on Saturday. &quot;A mother gives life and this one gives death, and we call this device a mother. What is happening?&quot;Pope Francis is set to meet US President Donald Trump on 24 May in a potentially awkward encounter given their opposing positions on immigration, refugees and climate change.
