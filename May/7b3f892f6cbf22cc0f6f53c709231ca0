EFF's Papiki Babuile says they want the NPA to fast-track the appeal and for the government to put a hold on the programme. COLIGNY The North West Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has organised a march to the Coligny Police Station on Friday to demonstrate against a magistrate's decision to grant bail to two men accused of murdering Matlhomola Moshoeu.The pair told the court that they caught Moshoeu stealing sunflowers at the farm they work on but that he jumped off the back of their bakkie and died while they were taking him to the police station.The North West ANC pacified the anger of the community in their announcement to appeal the bail decision and introduce the reconciliation programme in the community.WATCH: 'Apartheid still exists in Coligny'But the EFF's Papiki Babuile says they want the National Prosecuting Authority to fast-track the appeal and for the government to put a hold on the programme. The first step is that people must take account for what happened; the killings, abuse of our people in these areas and after that we can reconcile. Babuile says the party will submit a memorandum to the provincial police commissioner, which will include a list of cases from community members allegedly abandoned by the police.He says they expect over 5,000 people, including the party's leader Julius Malema, to join the march.
