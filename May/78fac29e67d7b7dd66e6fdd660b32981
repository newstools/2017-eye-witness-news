The South African Council of Churches has released the report of its Unburdening Panel, set up to allow people to provide information on state capture. SOWETO - South African Council of Churches (SACC) general secretary Malusi Mpumlwana says what has emerged from its 'Unburdening Panel' report is disconcerting.&quot;The problem is bigger than corruption, it's chaos,&quot; he said at the release of the report from its Unburdening Panel, which the SACC describes as a facility offered by the churches for people whom organisations and others have tried to bribe.The panel has dealt with the issue of state capture, saying there has been a syphoning off of funds.The report reveals damning information on current and former government employees on how the state has been captured by private individuals.The organisation says the panel was created to offer a safe platform for people to provide evidence or information on how they have been pressured by private individuals to act corruptly.They say the report was triggered by former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas' revelation that the Guptas had offered him R6 million for the position of finance minister.Mpumlwana read the findings of the report.&quot;There were cases of people at provincial and municipal level who were pressured to divert funds inappropriately to certain activities which had nothing to do with the work of and purpose of the budget.&quot;There were people who were prevailed upon to rig tender processes.&quot;He says they have also learnt that there is inappropriate control of the state by a powerful elite close to President Jacob Zuma, claiming that the group systematically syphons state asserts.&quot;Securing control over the state wealth through the capture of state-owned companies by chronically weakening their governance and structures. Also securing control over the country's fiscal sovereignty, we understand that's why they have issues with the Treasury.&quot;The organisation says many people opted to provide the information anonymously while others have gone public with their information.#SACC Chikane "the preliminary report was presented to church leaders last month.
