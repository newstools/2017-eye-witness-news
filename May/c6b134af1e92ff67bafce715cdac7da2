CAPE TOWN The City of Cape Town has scrapped plans to introduce a home-user electricity tariff for households in properties valued at a million rand or more.Mayor Patricia de Lille delivered the municipality's R44 billion budget for the 2017/18 financial year on Tuesday.De Lille has also presented the city's Integrated Development Plan, which maps out the City's plans and strategy for the next five years.In its draft budget, sent out for public comment two months ago, the City of Cape Town proposed the implementation of a monthly R250 electricity tariff for properties valued at over R1 million.But after an outcry during public participation meetings, Mayor Patricia de Lille says the city has decided against it. Consumers in properties above the value of R1 million will remain on the domestic tariff. There was great concern over the implementation of this charge, with over 1,000 comments, and we listened. Overall electricity tariffs are to increase by 3.3% and refuse collection by 6.5%.Heavy water users could see a 19% hike in their water bills from July and the water tariff for households who use between 6,000 and 35, 000 litres a month will increase by up to 10%.CITY SCRAPS FREE WATER TO ALL CITY RESIDENTSThe city has officially scrapped the provision of free water to all residents in the city.Previously, all households in the metro received 6,000 litres of water per month.But after council approved the municipality's budget for the 2017/18 financial year, only those who qualify will get free water from the city.Mayor Patricia de Lille says this is part of the plans to mitigate the current drought crisis.De Lille adds the municipality has set aside R1.4 billion for rates rebates. Any household with the gross income of R4,000 or less will get 100% rates rebate. Households earning more than R4,000 to R6,000 qualify for rates rebates between 25% and 75%.
