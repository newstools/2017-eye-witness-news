JOHANNESBURG – A group of 28 men working on a building site took on criminals attempting to hijack Dino Salgado in Bedfordview. Construction workers building houses next to Salgado’s home saw an armed man getting out of a Golf R then proceeded to throw half-bricks and huge rocks at the car. The gunmen opened fire on the builders who continued to throw rocks until the criminals fled in their damaged vehicle. The suspects left with a broken windscreen and side mirrors. Salgado said that the worker's actions gave him enough time to make it back into his garage and to close it. He thanked the workers for their help.
