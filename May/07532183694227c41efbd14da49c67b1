Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has welcomed the High Court's decision to dismiss lieutenant general Berning Ntlemeza's attempt to return to work. PRETORIA Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has welcomed the High Court's decision to dismiss lieutenant general Berning Ntlemeza's attempt to return to work, saying it has confirmed as correct his decision not to allow Ntlemeza back at work.The High Court in Pretoria ruled that Ntlemeza's application was not urgent because he had failed to demonstrate that he would suffer irreparable harm or prejudice by not being allowed to report for duty.The court ruled last month that the lieutenant general was not fit to hold the top post - a ruling he has taken on appeal.The minister says Thursday's judgement confirms that if the lieutenant general tries to appeal the order setting aside his appointment, he may not return to work until that appeal is heard.He says his decision to appoint an acting head of the Hawks was a correct one.Judge Sheila Mphahlele says Ntlemeza failed to demonstrate that he would face irreparable harm or prejudice by not being allowed to return to work. The appeal is already scheduled and will allow the applicant an opportunity to be heard. The hearing is set down to be heard on 2 June.
