Mayoral committee member for utilities Xanthea Limberg says the city has also finalised the list of the top 100 water users for March. We must also acknowledge that changing our relationship with water must be a societal shift in attitude and not only during a time of severe drought.

Meanwhile, the average dam level for the Western Cape stands at 20%.Local Government and Environmental Affairs spokesperson James-Brent Styan said: The latest update with regards to average dam level across the Western Cape is a further indication of a very serious crisis that the province is in. &quot;The dams are on an average of a fifth full. Last year this time, they were on 31% and last year was a terrible year, so this year is even worse.
