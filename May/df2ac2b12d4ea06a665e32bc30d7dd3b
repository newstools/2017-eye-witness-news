DA Mayor Athol Trollip removed Mongameli Bobani from the mayoral committee, saying he can no longer put up with his &#8216;erratic behaviour&#8217;. CAPE TOWN - United Democratic Movement (UDM) councillor Mongameli Bobani could be ousted as Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor in a move that threatens the Democratic Alliance (DA) and UDM coalition government.DA Mayor Athol Trollip this week removed Bobani from the mayoral committee.He says he can no longer put up with what he called Bobani s erratic behaviour .A motion of no confidence could also be brought against him in council. Coalition partners, which include Congress of the People (Cope) and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), have for months been intervening between the pair who don t see eye-to-eye on issues of governance.DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe says they re committed to resolving the matter. We ll gladly engage with General Holomisa and the leaders of all the other coalition parties to find that solution. But we cannot see that that solution includes Mr Bobani in his current position. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa is, however, refusing to budge on Bobani s removal. That s what we wrote to DA leader Mmusi Maimane to say he must rein in and talk to his men in Port Elizabeth to hold that action in abeyance until we ve discussed this matter. Bobani has been accused of protecting individuals implicated in municipal corruption.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
