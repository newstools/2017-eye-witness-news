Prominent South Africans, including Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Gwede Mantashe, will join the hunger strike in solidarity with Palestinian political prisoners. JOHANNESBURG The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation says it hopes the hunger strike they will embark on, in solidarity with Palestinian political prisoners, will send a strong message to Israel. Over 1, 500 political prisoners have been detained by the Israeli government. The prisoners have been on a hunger strike since 17 April, surviving only on salt water.The foundation says the #dignitystrikesa campaign aims to show Israel that South Africa stands with the Palestinian people in their quest for freedom and dignity.Kathrada Foundation director Neeshan Balton says prominent South Africans, including Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Gwede Mantashe and other cabinet ministers will join the hunger strike.Balton says they will embark on the strike from 6pm this evening. They are joining millions of people across the world who have come out in support of the demands of these Palestinian political prisoners, which are in themselves very basic demands. We hope that all of this will signal to Israel the will of the people across the world that they need to accede to these basic demands for these political prisoners.
