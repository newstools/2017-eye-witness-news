Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on the ANC to act with urgency on the report by the SACC. RUSTENBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on the African National Congress (ANC) to act with urgency on the report by the South African Council of Churches (SACC) if it wants to recover its leadership role in society.Ramaphosa addressed ANC and South African Communist Party (SACP) supporters at the Moses Kotane memorial lecture - in Rustenburg - earlier today.On Thursday, the SACC released its unburdening panel report which reveals damning information from current and former government employees on how the state has been captured by private individuals.It also revealed that there s inappropriate control of the state by a power elite close to President Jacob Zuma claiming that the group systematically siphons state assets.Ramaphosa says the ANC must act with urgency. Yes they ve released that report. They ve raised their concerns and if we as the ANC are to counter this grave threat if the ANC is to recover its leadership role in society then it s absolutely imperative that we act with urgency and purpose and make sure that we never become a mafia state.&quot;Because once we become a mafia state all the wheels have come off,&quot; said Ramaphosa, whose delivery was at times passionate, a marked contrast to his normally reserved manner.The SACP setting was a pointed one as the party is a key political ally of the ANC and has called for Zuma to resign.Relations between Zuma and Ramaphosa, 64, a former trade union organiser who led negotiations to end white rule in 1994, have become increasingly strained, according to local media reports.Zuma has consistently denied allegations of corruption levelled against him, his government and some associates, and branded protesters calling for his resignation racist .Ramaphosa also said that he had met with ratings agency Moody's on Friday and their view was that the ANC was on the verge of a split. He said he assured them that would not happen.Additional information by Reuters.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
