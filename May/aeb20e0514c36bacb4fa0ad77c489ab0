The Black First Land First Movement says it supports the return of Brian Molefe to Eskom as CEO. JOHANNESBURG The Black First Land First movement (BLF) says it supports the return of Brian Molefe to Eskom as CEO.The group says Molefe is more experienced and capable of transforming Eskom, saying all those who attack him are influenced by the white monopoly capital.Molefe is expected to return to his position following the power utility's decision to reinstate him, after resigning from Parliament last Friday.BLF president Andile Mngxitama says Molefe should be deployed to a top position in government. I would have hoped that he would not have returned to Eskom. I was hoping that the president would appoint him as the governor of the Reserve Bank. Brian needs to occupy in the highest position possible in the economy to help transformation happen. Meanwhile, Congress of the People (Cope) has warned Molefe not to report for duty on Monday because he will be prevented from entering the utility's gate.The party says it plans to block the entrance to Megawatt Park. Cope's Dennis Bloem says they will never allow anyone to turn the country into a banana republic. We are well in advance with our plans and are in talks with others to join us. Our free advice to Brian Molefe is that he must stay away from Megawatt Park on Monday to avoid embarrassment. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
