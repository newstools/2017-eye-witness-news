The NEC started to have a detailed analysis of the consequences of removing a sitting president, appreciating that some calls, especially those made by the opposition, are not so much about removing the present, but rather dislodging the ANC itself from power. And he s denied reports that Zuma threatened NEC members during his closing address. I don t know about the threats but in my nature, I don t get threatened by people talking in the meeting of the ANC. The NEC also wants a judicial commission of inquiry into all aspects of state power.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
