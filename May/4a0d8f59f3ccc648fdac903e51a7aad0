Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations met African heads of state on Saturday. TAORMINA, ITALY Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations met African heads of state on Saturday, the final day of their annual summit which has been marked by discord over climate change, but unity on tackling terrorism.Italy had hoped to make Africa the major focus of the annual G7 gathering, holding the discussions on the island of Sicily that has taken in hundreds of thousands of migrants over the past four years as they flee war and poverty back home.However, the two-day meeting got overshadowed by a suicide bombing in northern England on Monday that killed 22 people, and also got bogged down by lengthy discussions on the merit of free trade and the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle climate change.US President Donald Trump has yet to decide whether to honour a US commitment to greenhouse gas emissions and has pushed back against a lattice of international trade accords that he says have hurt American economic interests. We are having to talk about things settled years ago, said a top-level member of one G7 delegation, frustrated by the US position.Diplomats from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States worked late into the night to agree on the final communique, which was expected to be little more than six pages long, against 32 pages last year.A French presidential source said substantial progress had been made on the question of trade, particularly in the area of multilateralism, suggesting Trump may have bowed to pressure for a more collaborative approach to international commerce.Italy had hoped to emphasise the positive impact migration can have and to call on industrialised nations to open up more legal channels for immigration to try to slow the flow of people risking their lives to reach Europe on flimsy boats from Libya.That idea was shot down ahead of the meeting. There was very strong opposition by the Americans and British who wanted to refocus on security and water down the expansive language on freedom of movement, said a European diplomat, who declined to be named.
