Arsenal beat Chelsea 3-0 in a thrilling Premier League encounter at home in September. LONDON - Arsenal must make a quick start in Saturday's FA Cup final and clamp down on Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard to reduce his impact on the game, midfielder Aaron Ramsey has said. Arsenal beat Chelsea 3-0 in a thrilling Premier League encounter at home in September but Hazard drove Chelsea to a 3-1 win in February, scoring the second goal and being named Man of the Match at Stamford Bridge.&quot;I think the way we started the (home) game in the first half was very good. ... We were very quick, we counter-attacked well, closed them down, got about them.&quot; Ramsey told the club's website. &quot;It was a different game (away) and we perhaps let individuals have a bit too much space. Hazard went on a bit of a run and put the ball in the net.&quot;We can't let that happen again, we have to be right in his face and stop that at source.&quot;Arsenal are looking to seal their third FA Cup trophy in four years and win the competition for a record 13th time.
