The learners have expressed an array of concerns in connection with the lack of accommodation at the university. CAPE TOWN - A group of around 35 students have been illegally occupying a partially destroyed administration building at the University of the Western Cape (UWC).The institution's Luthando Thyalibonga says the learners have expressed an array of concerns in connection with the lack of accommodation at the university.UWC houses more than 3,300 students every year and plans are in place to double the availability over the next three years.But Thyalibonga says for now, demand outstrip the supply.He adds they are attempting to negotiate with the occupiers, who refuse to leave the building, which was the target of an arson attack during last year's Fees Must Fall protests. It is obviously not conducive space for people to live in. The building is supposed to be undergoing some construction work to fix it after the arson last year.
