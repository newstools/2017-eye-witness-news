Four people were shot and killed, and several others wounded, in what has been called a mass shooting incident in Elsies River. CAPE TOWN - Several Leonsdale residents have vowed to increase the fight against the scourge of gang violence in their suburb. Four people were shot and killed, and several others wounded, in what has been called a mass shooting incident in Elsies River outside Cape Town almost a week ago. Many Community members have gathered for a memorial service for the victims on Sunday afternoon.Some Leonsdale community members say they are furious following last Monday's mass shooting incident. They have made a desperate appeal to the youth not to engage in gang related activities. Leonsdale resident George Walters says the community is desperate. The people are now fed up. I think they are at that stage where they want to take the streets back, from anyone that wants to be in charge of the streets, the community wants to take its place and the church also wants to take its place. On Thursday Police Minister Fikile Mbalula visited the area to talk to the community about the scourge of violence and gangsterism. #ElsiesRiver Leonsdale community members at a memorial service for victims of a mass shooting incident of this past week.
