The DA has approached the court to compel President Zuma to hand over an &#8216;intelligence report&#8217;, which he allegedly relied on when he fired Pravin Gordhan &amp; his deputy. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has told the High Court in Pretoria its review of President Jacob Zuma s recent decision to reshuffle his Cabinet would be stymied should it be denied access to a so-called intelligence report.The party has approached the court to compel Zuma to hand over the report, which he allegedly relied on to fire former finance minister Pravin Gordhan.Zuma told senior African National Congress (ANC) officials after firing Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas at the end of March that he relied on an intelligence report which accused the pair of conspiring against him.The DA believes that it is entitled to this intelligence report. Zuma has, however, argued that because the decision was not administrative in nature, the DA can t make the request. Advocate Steven Budlender has argued that the application to obtain the report and Zuma s record of decision is urgent.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
