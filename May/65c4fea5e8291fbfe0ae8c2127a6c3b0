Parties have agreed to a proposal by ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu that an ad hoc committee is set up to investigate. CAPE TOWN Parliament is set to put the funding of political parties from both state coffers and private donations under the microscope.Parties have agreed to a proposal by African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu that an ad hoc committee is set up to investigate.Mthembu made the call last week when he described the R150 million in public funds split between the 12 parties represented in Parliament as a pittance and said private funding should be regulated and disclosed.The ANC chief whip says that the ad hoc committee will look at whether public funding of parties is adequate and regulations governing private donations, including their disclosure. There has been a huge cry by civil society that parties in our Parliamentary system do not disclose who their funders are. Political parties investment arms such as the ANC s Chancellor House, will also come under scrutiny.Opposition parties have backed the move.The next step is for the National Assembly to formally adopt a resolution setting up the ad hoc committee.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
