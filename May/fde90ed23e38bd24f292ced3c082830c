DURBAN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says there is a new wave spreading across Africa in which people are holding their leaders accountable and stopping them from engaging in corruption.Ramaphosa gave the closing address on Friday at the World Economic Forum on Africa meeting in Durban.He also says that Africa s education systems need to be overhauled.Ramaphosa was asked whether Africa had the right leadership in place.He says a new spirit is sweeping across the continent. We should just allow this wonderful spirit to spread because it s important that leaders should know that people are watching and listening. And he says people won't put up with bad leadership. And people are demanding that we as leaders must be so accountable that we should not mismanage resources, we should not be corrupt and we should be absolutely committed to improving the lives of our people. But Ramaphosa wouldn't be drawn on what could happen in the African National Congress' leadership contest in December. He added only ANC branches could decide who would lead the party after December. LEADERS SHOULD LEAD WITH RESPECT &amp; DIGNITY Ramaphosa says he agrees with the World Economic Forum head Klaus Schwab that leaders should lead only for the good of their people.On Thursday, Schwab was sharing a stage with President Jacob Zuma when he said leaders should not place their own interests above those of their people.Ramaphosa says he agrees: I could not agree more with what Mr Schwab said. Leaders should lead with respect and dignity and consider themselves as trustees. And he says people need to consider only what their children will need in the future. Are they going to inherit ashes, half-baked solutions or the best outcomes? (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
