DA leader Mmusi Maimane says the African National Congress must face electoral accountability. CAPE TOWN Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says worse than President Jacob Zuma acting in his own interests, is the African National Congress condonation of his actions.Maimane says Thursday s court ruling, compelling Zuma to hand over the record of the decision that led to the firing of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas to the DA, is a victory for South Africans.But he says the ruling party must also take responsibility for Zuma's actions. The ANC must face electoral accountability. The people in this country must know that Jacob Zuma doesn t act on his own, he acts as a kingpin of a mafia state. We need to ensure as South Africans that we hold the ANC to account. The opposition leader says the DA's been forced to turn to the courts because Parliament has also been ineffective. You can t have a speaker who is partisan. You can t have voting when people come and vote for Nkandla and literally supports his decisions. There must be a point where Parliament takes its power and holds him accountable. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
