Minister Lynne Brown confirmed this afternoon that she's directed the Eskom board to rescind Molefe's reappointment. JOHANNESBURG The inter-ministerial committee on Eskom says it s recommended the removal of Brian Molefe as the utility's chief executive officer for the good of the country.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown confirmed on Wednesday afternoon, that she's directed the Eskom board to rescind Molefe's reappointment based on the recommendations of the committee.Molefe was offered a R30 million pension payout after he stepped down last year following the release of the Public Protector's State of Capture report.Brown raised concerns about the payout, and the board decided to reinstate him instead.Justice Minister Michael Masutha, who is part of the committee, says Eskom made some major concessions about Molefe's appointment. When Mr Molefe stepped down, the board used the incorrect provisions in accepting his retirement, using a retrenchment provision. The board is of the view that the mistakes were made in good faith. In April 2015 Molefe, who was then the chief executive of Transnet was seconded to take over at Eskom, a move which Brown fully supported given his reputation of turning the state utility around.Brown still feels Molefe did just that at Eskom.Despite allegations of State Capture and dodgy deals with the Guptas to take over Optimum Coal Mine when Molefe returned to his post earlier this month, he was given a hero s welcome by staff.WATCH: Pickets &amp; Praises: Eskom boss returns to workBrown says Eskom is heavily implicated in the State of Capture report and the utility must be investigated. But for now, she's ensuring that it remains sustainable that investigations are concluded and that an acting CEO is appointed in the next two days.
