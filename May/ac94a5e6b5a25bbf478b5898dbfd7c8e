Mathews Phosa says he always knew his name would be cleared and that David Mabuza's lies on claims that he'd accused him of being a spy would be exposed. JOHANNESBURG Former African National Congress (ANC) treasurer-general Mathews Phosa says he does not intend to sue David Mabuza after the High Court in Pretoria dismissed the Mabuza's defamation case against Phosa on Friday.Mabuza's allegation stems from a so-called spy report in which its alleged he operated as a spy for the apartheid regime.Phosa came into possession of the report when his cook handed it to him, and the former Mpumalanga premier handed it to ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte.The ANC presidential hopeful says he always knew his name would be cleared and that Mabuza's lies would be exposed.Phosa says he does not want to sue because this would be stooping to the former premier s level. I don t intend to sue them ... like the finding says, they have defamed me. I would be stooping too low to their level by suing them. He says he has better things to do with his time. They are a stupid bunch of fools. They must be left alone and I want to move on. A former employee of Phosa's, Jan Venter, alleged that he overheard a conversation in which the politician concocted the spy allegations. However, in his judgement today Judge Bill Prinsloo rejected venter as an &quot;extremely poor witness&quot;.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
