CAPE TOWN - The University of the Western Cape (UWC) says they are in talks with a group of students who have illegally occupied a partially damaged building on the campus. The institution's Luthando Tyhalibongo says the group of about 35 learners have expressed an array of concerns in connection with the lack of accommodation at the university. UWC houses more than 3,300 students every year and plans are in place to double the availability over the next three years. But Tyhalibongo says demand outstrips the supply for now. He adds they are attempting to negotiate with the occupiers who refuse to leave the building, which was the target of an arson attack during last year's Fees Must Fall protests. “There have been talks between the university, the student representative council and the students themselves. Unfortunately, there have been points where they’ve been uncooperative.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
