The documentary will reportedly follow Janet Jackson as she juggles being a mother and a touring artist. LOS ANGELES - Music star Janet Jackson is reportedly set to appear in her own fly-on-the-wall documentary show. The 51-year-old singer-songwriter is reportedly locked in negotiations to sign a lucrative deal with Netflix  over her own ten-part show, which would give fans an insight into Janet's life in the wake of her recent split from her husband Wissam Al Mana. A source says: "Janet has been fiercely private about her life in the past but feels the need to keep her fans in the loop with what life has been like since she went into hiatus ten years ago." The show will follow Jackson - who gave birth to her first child Eissa, in January 2017 - as she goes about her day-to-day life. Netflix reportedly feels the documentary will prove to be popular with viewers. The insider told The Sun newspaper: "The show will run as a 10-part documentary and will feature recording sessions in the studio, co-parenting her child with Al Mana and preparing for the European and Asian legs of her tour. "Netflix is negotiating a big sum for the rights to the show as they expect it to perform well." This comes shortly after it was reported that Jackson's estranged husband sent her 100 flowers for her 51st birthday. Al Mana reportedly sent her a mix of roses and orchids in celebration of her special day on 16 May. "Janet and her husband are separated, but have a mutual love and admiration for each other. There doesn't seem to be a reconciliation in the future, but never say never," says another source. The source also says that while the singer appreciated the flowers, she "couldn't ask for a better gift than her precious baby boy".
