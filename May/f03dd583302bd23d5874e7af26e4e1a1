While the RTMC took over eNatis from Tasima, it says it is not responsible for the employees. But Tasima insists the staffers are now RTMC employees. PRETORIA About 80 Tasima employees have been left in the cold following the Road Traffic Management Corporation s (RTMC) takeover of the eNatis traffic system as a legal battle continues over who is responsible for paying their salaries.The company won a labour court application last month which found the RTMC is required to absorb the staff contingent but the ruling is being appealed.The Labour Court on Tuesday reserved judgment on an application to have that earlier ruling enforced, irrespective of any pending appeal.Concerned Tasima employees have approached Eyewitness News, saying they weren t paid as expected on the 25th of the month.The RTMC S Simon Zwane says as far as they re concerned, they re not responsible for Tasima staffers. We have argued that we have not taken over the company (Tasima), we have taken over a service. It is our view that they are employees of Tasima, not the RTMC. The takeover of the eNatis does not mean we take over even the employees. However, a former Tasima executive who declined to speak on the record says as far as he s concerned, and as per the Labour Court ruling, they are now RTMC employees.He is confident the staff will be paid soon.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
