The family&#8217;s domestic worker Precious Munyongani said the murder weapons looked the same as the ones that'd been in the house. CAPE TOWN - The defence for family axe murder accused Henri van Breda has questioned the origin of the murder weapon.The 22-year-old is charged with the murder of his parents and older brother and the attempted murder of his younger sister in their Stellenbosch home in January 2015.The family s domestic worker Precious Munyongani told the court the axe and knife she'd been shown by police after the attacks looked the same as the ones that'd been in the house. Munyongani says the axe was usually kept on a shelf in the scullery, and the knife in a drawer.Advocate Matthys Combrinck has scrutinised this detail, questioning whether the axe used in the attack really was the same one the family owned or rather one that looked similar and had been brought into the house by an outsider.Combrinck says another witness, Marli's boyfriend, had made a statement saying the axe police showed him looked different to the one the family owned.This prompting Judge Siraj Desai to tell Combrinck his line of questioning was &quot;torturous&quot;.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
