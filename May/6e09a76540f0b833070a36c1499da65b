I m still enjoying what I m doing. It s not my decision... but I ll answer it when it arises. She was also asked whether she thinks people are losing hope in the ANC given its current problems. They will get better and you can see that even this programme of Molo Makhwelane is about making sure not only that people have hope but, that they can get better assistance.
