Relatives of slain former TV actor and Jozi FM DJ say his widow and four children are traumatised by his death. JOHANNESBURG – Relatives of slain former TV actor and Jozi FM DJ Mandla Hlatshwayo say his widow and four children are traumatised by his death. Hlatshwayo and his friend only known as Chom-Chom were shot dead last night while trying to help two women who were robbed by an armed gang at a pub in Pimville Soweto. His uncle Jonathan, says the 40-year-old’s father died the same way a few years ago when he too was shot dead by armed men in Soweto. Jonathan says it's not easy for the family. “The mother can’t cope.” Hlatshwayo leaves behind a wife and four children between the ages of three years and 18 years. Meanwhile, a cleansing ceremony was earlier held at the scene where the DJ's body was found. At the same time, civil rights group Sonke Gender Justice has commended the slain actor for his heroic act that led to his death in Soweto. Sonke Gender Justice's Nonhlanhla Skosana said: “We always encourage men to get involved, it’s sad to see men creating safe spaces for women and then they get killed.”  HLATSHWAYO DESCRIBED AS LOVING FATHER Hlatshwayo’s family has described him as a loving father with a big heart. Jonathan says his nephew never missed an opportunity to help others. “He was a guy who liked to help people… he was a good guy.” While police are still searching for the suspects, a neighbour says she heard four gunshots ring out just after 23h00 last night. She says she feared for her life. “There were ladies who were about to be robbed and that’s when Mandla and his friend went out.” Jozi FM colleagues gathered outside the pub earlier, where Hlatshwayo's radio co-host visibly traumatised, refused to speak to the media.
