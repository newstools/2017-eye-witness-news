Reports have emerged claiming that Bonginkosi Madikizela surprise party at Cape Town's One&amp;Only hotel was paid for by unnamed building contractors who do business with the department. CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela says claims of impropriety related to his birthday party in March are nothing more than a smear campaign to derail his Democratic Alliance (DA) provincial leadership ambitions.Reports have emerged claiming that Madikizela's surprise party at Cape Town's One&amp;Only hotel was paid for by unnamed building contractors who do business with the department.But Madikizela, who is also the party's acting provincial leader, says the party was paid for by his friends.Madikizela has acknowledged that a friend, who is also linked to a company that does business with his department, contributed towards a cake for him.But says she's an old friend, who has been doing business with the department even before his appointment as MEC. I had no way of knowing who sponsored the party or who contributed what to the party. As you normally do, as friends we go out and celebrate each other's birthdays. Madikizela says detractors should name those involved in the alleged impropriety, so the matter can be fully investigated. The timing of it is clearly well orchestrated to coincide with the congress that's coming up. The DA is expected to elect a new provincial leader in September.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
