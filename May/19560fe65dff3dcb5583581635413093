LONDON - British MPs are demanding social media companies like Facebook and Twitter be forced to pay for the cost of policing digital crimes. They argue charges are levied on football clubs, late-night drinking clubs and pubs to combat certain types of crime and social media should be no different.It s estimated that half of all crime reported to the British police has an element of social media involvement.Terrorist offences, hate crimes and threat of violence are all being regularly conducted online and there s growing anger at the reluctant approach of social media companies to play their part in dealing with the matter.A committee of MPs says Twitter, Google and Facebook have been acting completely irresponsibly and indefensibly.Such companies argue it isn t their job to police the internet and they already take down offensive material.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
