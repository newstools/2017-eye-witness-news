Concerns have also been raised that some buildings are not friendly to disabled students.UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola says they are aware of the HRC complaint. New buildings on campus have to confirm to street accessibility and when any significant maintenance takes place, accessibility challenges for people with disabilities have to be addressed.
