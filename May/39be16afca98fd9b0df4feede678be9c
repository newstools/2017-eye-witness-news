A spelling error on an incomplete tweet kept the US up last night. President Donald Trump began a tweet that appeared to slam the US press about the way he is covered in some media.For some reason, he did not complete the tweet but posted it with a spelling error that has since become one of his most retweeted posts.#Covfefe trended globally and in South Africa as Twitter sought to see who could come up with the best meme.In the end, the tweet was deleted (although you can never really delete them), with President Trump posting his own follow-up acknowledging and possibly liking how influential he can be even if only when making a mistake.
