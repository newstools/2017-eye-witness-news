The DA says it seeks to interdict Molefe from performing duties and functions at Eskom. CAPE TOWN The Democratic Alliance (DA) has today filed an urgent two-part application with the North Gauteng High Court which has been served on reappointed Eskom CEO Brian Molefe.The party says it seeks to interdict Molefe from performing duties and functions at the power utility and prevent him from receiving any benefits associated with the position.The DA says the second part of the application requests the court review and set aside his reinstatement.The party s James Selfe said: It s quite clear that the minister wants Molefe back at Eskom and what is bizarre is that he stepped down in order to clear his name and now the minister has reappointed him. The utility's board says it came up with a mutually acceptable option after public enterprises Minister Lynne Brown questioned Molefe's R30 million pension payout when he resigned as CEO last year.Molefe stepped down saying it was in the interest of good governance after the public protector's State of Capture report revealed his relationship with the controversial Gupta family.The opposition party says it wants the High Court in Pretoria to review and set aside Molefe's reinstatement.Molefe reported for duty early on Monday morning after he resigned as a Member of Parliament.WATCH: Pickets and praise: Eskom boss returns to work(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
