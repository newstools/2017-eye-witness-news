CAPE TOWN - The South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) chief executive Thokozani Magwaza has hinted aspects of a plan to take over the payment of grants may not be above board.This comes in the wake of reports workstreams employed to effect the takeover have already cost the agency R40 million.They were appointed by Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini in 2015.The workstreams appointed by Dlamini were projected to cost around R47 million.But on Monday, Magwaza alluded they may be subject to a challenge. There's a process that's taking place with Treasury. Treasury has just given us a letter on the regularity or the irregularity of the work streams. Magwaza says he cannot divulge the letter's content until he's advised the minister of steps he plans to take.He adds he hopes to have cleared up the matter before he and the minister are scheduled to appear before a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.
