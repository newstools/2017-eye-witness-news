Before that, children were banned from the chamber and breastfeeding mothers were given a proxy vote.Shortly after Joy was born, the proud mother took to Facebook to announce that she will be attending parliamentary proceedings with her daughter in tow. She is even more inspiration for continuing our work to address gender inequality and stem dangerous climate change. (And yes, if she's hungry, she will be breastfed in the Senate chamber). Waters even went on to give props to mother who are juggling everything . To all the awesome mums out there juggling everything - you are the real superheroes.
