CAPE TOWN - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says no woman should be turned away from a police station.He made the comments while addressing the South African Sheriff Society in Stellenbosch on Friday.Violence against women has been in the spotlight in the wake of the murders of several women and children in the country.Mbalula says he spoke to a woman who was harassed by a former partner. She said that she had been terrorised by a man after their divorce for two years. She showed the messages on what he had done to her and said she reported the cases for two years to the police. She said, I m afraid that I ll be another victim. He says the suspect was arrested shortly afterwards in Soweto.The minister adds they are working with cluster commanders to make sure that women get taken seriously when reporting crime. When a woman goes to a police station and reports rape, she is treated like there was no rape. It is treated as a by the way case. We are putting a stop to this. In the coming weeks, you ll see us in our police stations. No woman should be turned away from a police station whenever she goes to report crime. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
