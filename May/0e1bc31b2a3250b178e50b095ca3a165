Paul Cluver received the Platinum Best in Show award for its Seven Flags Chardonnay 2016 by the Decanter World Wine Awards 2017, which were announced this week.  Another Western Cape winery, Klein Constantia, received a Platinum Best in Show award for its Vin de Constance, one of the estate's well-known sweet wines. More than 200 experts started the judging process for this year's awards in London last month. Western Cape Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde said, “We need to be known far more for our great wines so well done to Paul Cluver and he helps us as a region to move into a better arena.” (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
