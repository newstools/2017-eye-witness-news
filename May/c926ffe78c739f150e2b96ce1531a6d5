Hantam High officials say govt's annual subsidy of R268,000 is not nearly enough to settle its expenses of more than R800,000. CAPE TOWN - A Northern Cape Education Department delegation is set to engage with Calvinia community members over a local high school's financial crisis. The power supply to the Hantam High School in Calvinia west had been cut off since the start of the second school term in April. The department last week provided funds to have the electricity switched on, but some community members are demanding a more sustainable, long-term plan to keep the school open. Teaching and learning at the Hantam High School came to a halt due to the school's electricity supply being switched off. The school was unable to settle an outstanding Eskom bill of R140,000.Hantam High officials say government's annual subsidy of R268,000 is not nearly enough to settle its expenses of more than R800,000.The provincial education department's Geoffrey van der Merwe says he will be meeting with the community to plan ahead. Currently we can confirm that the school is closed but as agreed with the parents and the school governing body, school at Hantam High will continue as normal from tomorrow. The department has so far made R150,000 available to assist the institution. Education department officials say a plan will be implemented to catch up with teaching and learning.
