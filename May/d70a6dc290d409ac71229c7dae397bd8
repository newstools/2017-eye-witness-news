The KwaZulu-Natal ANC leadership says Ramaphosa undermined party traditions, which is to inform provincial leadership in order to welcome and have a delegation assigned to a senior official. DURBAN The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says it has written to secretary-general Gwede Mantashe to have deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa explain why he went to political events in the province without their knowledge.The KwaZulu-Natal leadership has given details of the outcome of its executive meeting at the weekend.It says Ramaphosa undermined party traditions, which is to inform provincial leadership in order to welcome and have a delegation assigned to a senior official.The KZN ANC leadership says when it invited Ramaphosa to assist with campaigning in Nquthu two weeks ago, he made no mention of his plans to go to Newcastle for a cadres forum.The gathering had been organised by alliance partner the South African National Civic Organisation, which reportedly endorsed Ramaphosa at its provincial executive meeting this week.KZN ANC spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said: That was not a genuine meeting. Why would it be difficult when you are invited by [the] province to come and campaign for two days? In one evening of the first day of your campaign, you engage yourself in an activity that is not including the leadership of the ANC in the very same province that has invited you to come down. The matter has been brought to the attention of Mantashe, who according to the KZN ANC, has been urged to bring this to the attention of the national executive committee.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
