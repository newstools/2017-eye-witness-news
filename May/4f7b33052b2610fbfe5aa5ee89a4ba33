As the regulator we believe that the National Credit Act was drafted in a way that brings clarity within the industry. However, the retail group has released a statement saying it has noted the tribunal's judgment and it is now in the process of studying it and will appeal the order. The retailer says it s always contended that the club product is a stand-alone one which entitles voluntarily signed-up from members to a number of benefits including preferential rates and savings with many of their affinity partners. The National Credit Regulator could not specify how much Edcon was unlawfully charging its customers, saying this will be established at a later stage.
