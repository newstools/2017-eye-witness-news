The KZN provincial secretary also strongly emphasized that the province will lead the biggest delegation to the elective conference. DURBAN KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress (ANC) secretary Super Zuma says anyone hoping to become the leader of this country must discuss its future plans with the province first or face losing the presidential campaign.Zuma, who is not related to the president, was speaking at a business gala dinner organised by the Moses Mabhida region in Pietermaritzburg on Thursday night.He says claims that Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is on the campaign trail are unsubstantiated because if it were true, she would have been visiting ANC branches.The KZN provincial secretary also strongly emphasized that the province will lead the biggest delegation to the elective conference.Zuma says they are currently auditing their membership figures. We ll be leading the biggest delegations as KwaZulu-Natal, so if you want to discuss the future of this country, you must first consult with us as KwaZulu-Natal. If you undermine us and think you can t discuss with us, you ll be left alone come the conference in December. RAMAPHOSA'S VISIT WAS NOT APPROVEDOn Wednesday, the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal said it had written to secretary-general Gwede Mantashe to have deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa explain why he went to political events in the province without their knowledge.The KwaZulu-Natal leadership has given details of the outcome of its executive meeting at the weekend.It says Ramaphosa undermined party traditions, which is to inform provincial leadership in order to welcome and have a delegation assigned to a senior official.The KZN ANC leadership says when it invited Ramaphosa to assist with campaigning in Nquthu two weeks ago, he made no mention of his plans to go to Newcastle for a cadres forum.The gathering had been organised by alliance partner the South African National Civic Organisation, which reportedly endorsed Ramaphosa at its provincial executive meeting this week.KZN ANC spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said: That was not a genuine meeting. Why would it be difficult when you are invited by [the] province to come and campaign for two days? In one evening of the first day of your campaign, you engage yourself in an activity that is not including the leadership of the ANC in the very same province that has invited you to come down. The matter has been brought to the attention of Mantashe, who according to the KZN ANC, has been urged to bring this to the attention of the national executive committee.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
