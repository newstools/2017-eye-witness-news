CAPE TOWN - Eskom s chief nuclear officer Dave Nichols says nuclear technology is one of the only options South Africa has to ensure the lights stay on in the future.Nichols was part of a panel discussion at the Africa Utility Week Conference in Cape Town on Thursday morning.Last month, the Western Cape High court ruled the country s new nuclear build programme couldn't go ahead, citing procedural concerns.Nichols has told delegates that Eskom s current nuclear power facility runs at a fraction of the cost of its other technologies, adding it is also the cleanest.He says besides environmental concerns; the country s coal power stations are coming to the end of their lifespan and need to be replaced.Nichols says sources other than coal and nuclear have not yet been proven successful and sustainable in South Africa.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
