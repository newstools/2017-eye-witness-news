PARLIAMENT - Acting National Police Commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane says the Hawks must learn a lesson from the case involving the alleged coup plotter Elvis Ramosebudi.The elite crime fighting unit announced the 33-year-old s arrest last month, linking him to hit lists targeting beneficiaries of state capture, including President Jacob Zuma and the Gupta brothers.Parliament s Police Committee on Thursday wanted to know why the charges were watered down from conspiracy to murder and then to incitement to murder when Ramosebudi appeared in court.Phahlane referred to the incident as unfortunate . I think if there is one lesson that we ourselves must learn is what information we communicate. But as far as possible, refrain from providing too much detail on a matter which is still under investigation. Phahlane did not directly answer MPs questions whether the case was the reason Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was being protected by the Presidential Protection Unit. However, he reiterated that a risk assessment warranted this level of state-funded security.Phahlane says Ramosebudi is to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
