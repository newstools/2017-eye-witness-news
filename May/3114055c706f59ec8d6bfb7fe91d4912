DA's Athol Trollip complains that UDM's Mongameli Bobani is uncontrollable, undermines the coalition and should be replaced. CAPE TOWN - Coalition partners in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro have expressed concern that the current conflict between the mayor and his deputy, undermines the multi-party government.They launched an investigation this week in an attempt to get to the bottom of tensions between the Democratic Alliance's Athol Trollip and the United Democratic Movement's Mongameli Bobani.Trollip and Bobani have been at loggerheads for months; they don't see eye-to-eye on governance and appointment of senior municipal staff among others.The panel consisting of Cope, the ACDP and the Freedom Front Plus found there's a breakdown of trust between Trollip and Bobani.It also says both had breached the coalition agreement by making public statements against the other without referring disputes to national leaders.According to the panel's report, Trollip complains that Bobani is uncontrollable, undermines the coalition and should be replaced.On the other hand, Bobani has told the body that Trollip is domineering, does not consult properly and infringes on his independence as a representative of another political party.The panel says the coalition partners as well as the mayoral committee have, however, expressed their support for Trollip as mayor.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
