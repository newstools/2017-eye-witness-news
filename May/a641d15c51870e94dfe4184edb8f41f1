Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is to deliver the welcoming address at the African Utility Week conference today. CAPE TOWN - Reappointed Eskom boss Brian Molefe is expected at his first public engagement on Tuesday since the surprise announcement of his return to the power utility on Friday. Molefe is to deliver the welcoming address at the African Utility Week conference which starts in Cape Town on Tuesday morning. Eskom board chairperson Ben Ngubane is also among the speakers.Under his leadership, the board on Thursday decided to have the African National Congress MP return to the parastatal, rather than pay him a R30 million pension payout, which was questioned by Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown.But the Democratic Alliance s (DA) James Selfe says the decision can' t be rationalised. Our intention is to freeze the payment of all and any monies to Mr Molefe until such time as the court has determined whether his appointment is lawful or not. The DA has filed an urgent application to interdict Molefe from working at Eskom. But Molefe was welcomed back to Eskom by singing and cheering employees on Monday.Molefe, Brown and Eskom, have until Wednesday to indicate whether they plan to oppose the application which the DA hopes will be heard on 30 May.WATCH: Pickets &amp; Praise: Eskom boss returns to work(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
