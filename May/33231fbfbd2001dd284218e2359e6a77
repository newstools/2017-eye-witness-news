CAPE TOWN A second successful penis transplant has been carried out at Tygerberg Hospital.Experts from Stellenbosch University s Medical Faculty performed the nine-and-a-half hour long procedure last month.A study has shown as many as 250 partial and total amputations take place in South Africa annually.Urology Division Head, Professor Andre van der Merwe, says the second operation shows the procedure can be carried out on a regular basis. We can help present these figures to the government and say this is what we, in two cases, found and would you consider funding this because at the moment funding seems to be the problem. In 2014, Van der Merwe led a team in performing the world's first successful penile transplant.The then 21-year-old recipient's penis had to be amputated in order to save his life when he developed severe complications after a traditional circumcision.
