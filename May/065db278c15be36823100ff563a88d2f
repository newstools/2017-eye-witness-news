KINSHASA - Democratic Republic of Congo's health ministry has approved the use of a new Ebola vaccine to counter an outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever in northeastern Congo that has killed four people, a spokesman said on Monday.&quot;The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontiers team that is arriving [in Congo] today to validate the protocol with the technical teams,&quot; Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, said. Health authorities are monitoring more than 400 people who came into contact with sufferers and have dispatched mobile laboratories to the zone to more quickly test people who display symptoms.The affected zone s extreme isolation has helped contain the highly contagious virus spread, although a lack of telecommunications, few paved roads and a shortage of thermometers have hindered the response.
