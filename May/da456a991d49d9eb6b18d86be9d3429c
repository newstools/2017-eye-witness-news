New Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi confirmed the reserves were sold after her predecessor Tina Joemat-Petterson said they were merely rotated. CAPE TOWN - The board of the Central Energy Fund (CEF) says it only found out about the sale of South Africa's oil reserves five months after the contracts were concluded.The transaction was placed in the spotlight after former Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Petterson told Parliament the move was merely a rotation of the country's reserves.But new Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi has since confirmed it was a sale worth $280 million.The Department of Energy, the CEF and the Strategic Fuel Fund briefed the Portfolio Committee on Energy on the report of the sale of reserves on Tuesday.The deal was struck with three companies between December 2015 and January 2016. The report has further highlighted the many procedural contraventions, including the use of a closed tender process.Kubayi has warned she is considering criminal procedures in connection with the sale.But Members of Parliament such as the Democratic Alliance's Gordon Mackay were not satisfied with the CEF's explanation. Frankly the fact that a board only became aware of a problem at its subsidiary five months after a sale is deeply, deeply alarming and is a massive breakdown in corporate governance, said Mackay.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
