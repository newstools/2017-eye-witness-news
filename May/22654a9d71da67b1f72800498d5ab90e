PARLIAMENT - Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini says she s disappointed by a court ruling allowing certain deductions from grant beneficiary bank accounts.South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) Chief Executive Officer Thokozani Magwaza agrees and says the agency is considering appealing.Dlamini and Magwaza appeared before Parliament's Social Development Portfolio committee on Wednesday to bring MPs up to speed on what's being done to meet the Constitutional Court ruling by next year.But both say they won't be ready to pay grants independently.Dlamini says she's open to all state institutions assisting Sassa to be able to pay out social grants - including the Post Office. It's not going to take 12 months to bring the whole programme into its totality. Yes, the company that is paying has to go, we agree. But Magwaza was more cautious on how long the takeover would take. We have not pronounced whether it's five years or not. We will pronounce when we do the timeframes. Magwaza says meetings with the Post Office will continue next week.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
