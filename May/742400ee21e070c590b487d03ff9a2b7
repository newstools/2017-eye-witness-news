Paul Mashatile says the reaction at May Day events exposes exactly how deep the crisis within the ANC goes. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) chairperson Paul Mashatile says only the ruling party's top six can explain why it s been so hard to remove President Jacob Zuma from office.The president was forced to leave a Cosatu May Day Rally in Bloemfontein on Monday after workers heckled and booed him before he could deliver his keynote address.In KwaZulu-Natal, ANC national chairperson Baleka Mbete and provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala were also booed, while deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte also had a tough time addressing workers in Limpopo.Mashatile says the reaction at May Day events, and especially the main rally in Bloemfontein, does not only prove there's a crisis within the ANC - but also exposes exactly how deep the crisis goes.Mashatile says if South Africans want to know why Zuma is still president, they should ask the top six. Why is it difficult to remove Zuma? I think that s the question that must be answered by the NEC. Our position in Gauteng is known; I don t have to repeat it. The Gauteng ANC chair says political developments within the party are worrying.The ANC in Gauteng has been known to be unsupportive of Zuma since David Makhura became premier.It wants the president to step down and his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa to take over.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
