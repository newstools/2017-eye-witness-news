CAPE TOWN - Triple murder accused Henri van Breda will hear further evidence from the first policeman who was on the scene where his parents and brother were killed.Tuesday marks the fourth day of van Breda's trial.He's accused of killing his parents and older brother and seriously injuring his sister at their Stellenbosch home in 2015. Police officer Adrian Kleynhans is expected to take the witness stand and will be cross-examined by van Breda's defence team.Kleynhans has already been cross-examined by the State on the details of what he found when he arrived at the crime scene. Defence lawyer Pieter Botha is expected to hone in on the policeman, saying it would've been very difficult for an intruder to scale the property's wall and gate. Last week, during an in loco inspection, a defence lawyer demonstrated the ease in gaining entry to the Goske Street home by jumping over a low wall and the side entrance gate.In his plea explanation, Van Breda claims that a laughing, axe-wielding intruder killed his parents and brother and injured his sister.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
