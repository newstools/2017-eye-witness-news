CAPE TOWN - Political parties in coalition in Nelson Mandela Bay will hold crisis talks after a breakdown in relations between the mayor and his deputy. Democratic Alliance (DA) Mayor Athol Trollip axed his United Democratic Movement (UDM) deputy Mongameli Bobani from his mayoral committee on Tuesday following months of conflict. A coalition government was formed by the DA, UDM, African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and Congress of the People (COPE) to oust the African National Congress (ANC) after local government elections in August 2016. The DA last week sent a letter to UDM leader Bantu Holomisa demanding the party withdraw Bobani from the mayoral committee.The ultimatum was rejected by the UDM which says it will not be dictated to by the DA. Holomisa says Bobani s removal is worrying. It s a concern for many of us but we want to get to the bottom of this that s why we re calling for a meeting and that they be represented. In a statement, Trollip explained he removed Bobani because he was apparently standing in the way of progress and made false and defamatory statements against the administration. Trollip also announced plans to have Bobani removed as deputy mayor.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
