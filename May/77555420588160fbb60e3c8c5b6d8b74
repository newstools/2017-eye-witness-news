The deputy president&#8217;s spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepa says these allegations are just an attempt to tarnish Cyril Ramaphosa&#8217;s name. JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has denied the claims of South Sudanese rebels that he is taking bribes from President Salva Kiir s government.The rebels claim Ramaphosa has been receiving the money in order to block their leader Riek Machar.The deputy president s spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepa says these allegations are just an attempt to tarnish Ramaphosa s name. The real issue is that there s no truth to these allegations. It s libellous and in our view, it s an attempt to tarnish the otherwise good name, reputation and integrity of the deputy president. Mamoepa says Ramaphosa will continue to serve as a special envoy to South Sudan as appointed by President Jacob Zuma. The current conflict in South Sudan has its genesis in the conflict with the ruling party. The deputy president and Abdulrahman Omari Kinana, the Secretary-General of Chama Cha Mapinduzi in Tanzania, have been seized with the responsibility of ensuring peace and harmony in the ranks of FPLA to ensure that there is peace in South Sudan.
