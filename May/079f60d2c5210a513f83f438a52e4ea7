Scopa says the rot at the South African Broadcasting Corporation will continue unless key figures at the top are removed. PARLIAMENT - Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) says the rot at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) will continue unless key figures at the top are removed.Scopa on Wednesday called on the board to take disciplinary steps against the chief financial officer James Aguma for dodging the meeting, even though he s on sick leave. MPs said the SABC had become a rogue entity and that Aguma was a rotten potato .Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo says the lack of record keeping is a major problem at the SABC, with some employees even leaving the organisation with documents.The African National Congress (ANC) s Vincent Smith says: I think we must call a spade a spade, minister. You and I know the lack of record keeping or the destruction of records is to destroy incriminating evidence. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) s Mkhuleko Hlengwa says: There's a mafia operating in the SABC. And you are going to need to be very firm in terms of how you root it out working with the board. The ANC's Nthabiseng Khunou says Aguma cannot be removed from the organisation until he's explained all his wrongful actions. Everything he does, whatever he touches, turns to black. Dlodlo told the committee she could not agree to suspending Aguma in a public forum but had faith in the board to act accordingly.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
