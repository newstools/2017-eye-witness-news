Newly elected DA Eastern Cape leader Nqaba Bhanga says he wants the party to govern the province within two years&#8217; time. JOHANNESBURG Newly elected Democratic Alliance (DA) Eastern Cape leader Nqaba Bhanga says he wants the party to govern the province within two years time.Bhanga, who left the Congress of the People in 2014 to join the DA, defeated the party's outgoing chairperson Veliswa Mvenya at its congress in East London yesterday.He has replaced Athol Trollip who's headed the DA in the province since 2002.The party received just over 16 percent of the votes in the Eastern Cape during the 2014 general election while the ANC got 70 percent.But he has set himself and the new leadership the task of reversing those outcomes. We are going to prepare a party of government and not just opposition because we are no longer an opposition party. He adds the current ANC administration has failed to deliver services to residents. The level of unemployment in this province is a concern. Bhanga says the DA plans to change that by creating job opportunities and ensuring the education system benefits people in the province.
