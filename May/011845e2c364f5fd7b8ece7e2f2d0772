Members of Cosatu said Jacob Zuma should not have been allowed to speak at the federation's May Day celebrations in the first place. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says its central executive committee (CEC) is now deciding on whether to allow President Jacob Zuma to ever address any of its meetings again after he was booed at the federation's May Day celebrations.The meeting is discussing the fall-out from that incident, which saw members of Cosatu saying Zuma should not have been allowed to speak at the event in the first place because the federation had already taken a decision that he should step down as president.The May Day rally in Bloemfontein was stopped before any of the speeches were made because of the booing.Cosatu's top leaders are now locked in a closed-door meeting to discuss what happened on May Day.The federation's Sizwe Pamla says they're discussing whether this means Zuma now could never address a Cosatu meeting again while he is still president. The CEC is going to have to discuss that and take a clear decision as to whether we are unanimous in that decision; whether it will be the position of Cosatu going forward that we are not going to allow Zuma to address any of our meetings. Meanwhile, Cosatu is due to hold its central committee next week and the ANC would normally be expected to send a top leader to speak at that meeting.Pamla says they have to make a decision urgently. We are reflecting on what transpired in Bloemfontein where some of our workers made it very clear that they were no longer prepared to be addressed by the president of the republic. If the committee decides Zuma cannot address them, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa may have to go instead. Cosatu has already said it's backing him at the ANC's leadership conference in December.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
