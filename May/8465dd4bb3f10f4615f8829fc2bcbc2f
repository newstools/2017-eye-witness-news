Last week Malusi Gigaba told the National Assembly that the government had yet to decide on a minority equity partner for SAA. CAPE TOWN National Treasury is considering various options to recapitalise South African Airways (SAA), including the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) as a possible equity partner.Last week Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba told the National Assembly that the government had yet to decide on a minority equity partner for SAA and said it might not be a private entity.The Democratic Alliance (DA) pressed acting director-general Dondo Mogejane for answers when SAA and Treasury briefed parliament s Standing Committee on Finance earlier on Wednesday. The DA s Alf Lees asked whether the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) would be used, through the public investment corporation, to refinance SAA. We re left with the distinct impression there s going to be an attempt to get the GEPF through PIC to be the so-called public equity partner.&quot; Mogejane was non-committal but did not discount the possibility. The long-term view is let s have options of looking at all that s available to us. The DA s David Maynier said: I find that frankly terrifying that Treasury would even consider using pensioners savings to bail out SAA, which is a serial loss-making, failing state-owned company that has in my view no prospect of ever becoming profitable or sustainable ever.
