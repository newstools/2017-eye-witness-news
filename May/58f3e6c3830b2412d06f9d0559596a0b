CAPE TOWN Police Minister Fikile Mbalula will be called to appear before Parliament's Police Committee so Members of Parliament (MPs) can directly express their concerns over the continuing stand-off between police watchdog body Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) and the acting head of the police.Tensions between the two escalated on Tuesday when Ipid head Robert McBride and acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane clashed over Ipid's belief that Phahlane is impeding the Ipid investigation into allegations against him.Committee chairperson Francois Beukman said: There were some recommendations from the floor, I think it is quite critical that we call the minister of police, the honourable Fikile Mbalula, to this committee, to indicate the concerns that were raised. The police watchdog wants the acting national commissioner suspended or placed on leave until its investigation against him into alleged tender and other irregularities is concluded.But Phahlane has accused the independent police watchdog body of having been captured by private investigator Paul O 'Sullivan, the complainant in the case against him.McBride says O Sullivan s involvement in the matter has been minimal.(Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
