The DA had first asked for the report from the Presidency as part of its court application over sacking of Pravin Gordhan. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has confirmed that lawyers acting for the Presidency have now demanded that the party hand over a so-called intelligence report that the party says was used by President Jacob Zuma to justify the sacking of Pravin Gordhan.The DA had first asked for the report from the Presidency as part of its application to have the decision to sack Gordhan declared legally irrational.But now the Presidency is claiming that it is the DA that must hand over the report.The DA's James Selfe says this doesn't make sense. We find this completely bizarre since we were referring to the existence of the report by a report in the media and clips on television. The DA says it believes the Presidency is asking it to produce the report as a delaying tactic.In the hours after President Zuma's reshuffle, senior African National Congress (ANC) leaders, including Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, confirmed that Zuma had said he had an intelligence document that contained evidence that meant he had to remove Gordhan.But the ANC's national working committee then publicly said the report was used as the only reason for the reshuffle, which was unfortunate and incorrect.Selfe added: We ve been in this navy before during the spy tapes saga, where the president will use every loophole, legal trick or trade brought out by [Zuma's lawyer Michael] Hulley to delay the inevitable. Zuma has until Thursday to give the documents he used to make his decision to the High Court in Pretoria. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
