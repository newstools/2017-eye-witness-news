This after Mongameli Bobani allegedly disrupted a council meeting and voted against the DA on some agenda items. CAPE TOWN Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called on the United Democratic Movement (UDM) to discipline Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani.This after Bobani allegedly disrupted a council meeting and voted against the DA on some agenda items. The instruction to the UDM by its coalition partner comes less than 24-hours after the DA rescinded its decision to fire Bobani from the mayoral committee. Before last night's crisis talks, the DA also wanted the UDM councillor removed as deputy mayor.Maimane's spokesperson Graham Charters said: Councillor Bobani's actions today in council added to disruptive and divisive behaviour throughout his tenure as the deputy executive mayor in contravention of this coalition agreement. And the DA, our first responsibility is to the voters of Nelson Mandela Bay. Earlier UDM leader Bantu Holomisa told EWN the party's intention was never to take sides. Right from the word go, the UDM has never wanted to defend Bobani or blame so and so. We have been saying let us investigate this matter.
