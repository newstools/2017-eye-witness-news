HARARE - It s just a year to go before elections in Zimbabwe and the latest survey by Afrobarometer says 64% of Zimbabweans trust President Robert Mugabe.The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) led by Morgan Tsvangirai says it s not fazed by the results, which showed only 32% of Zimbabwean adults trust opposition political parties.The survey polled 1,200 Zimbabwean adults in January and February.Sixty-four percent said they trusted President Mugabe, either a lot or somewhat.By comparison, only 32% said the same about opposition political parties, some of them now edging towards a coalition.MDC Spokesman Obert Gutu says the results need to be looked at with Zimbabwe-specific lenses.He says a culture of fear prevails, especially in the rural areas, where respondents are likely to give an answer that doesn't upset those in power.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
