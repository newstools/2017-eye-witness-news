Eskom's Loyiso Tyabashe says they need to start training people residing near possible sites now to ensure they have the skills to operate a nuclear plant. CAPE TOWN â€“ Eskom's new nuclear build manager Loyiso Tyabashe says if the project gets the go ahead 'they will take South Africans' forward with them. He was among panellists discussing the future in South Africa at the African Utility Week in Cape Town. Last month's High Court ruling on the country's new nuclear build programme was among the key issues that were discussed. Tyabashe says they need to start training people residing near possible sites now to ensure they have the skills to operate a nuclear plant. He adds small and medium enterprises must also be in "a state of readiness".
