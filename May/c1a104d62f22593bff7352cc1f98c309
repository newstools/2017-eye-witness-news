Tokyo Sexwale says he's extremely worried about Trillian&#8217;s conduct with regards to Eskom and the Guptas. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress veteran Tokyo Sexwale has distanced himself from Gupta-linked company Trillian, warning that what the country is experiencing now is not state capture but rather state handover.Sexwale, who is an independent non-executive chairman of Trillian Capital, says he's escalated the investigation into the firm to a judicial inquiry as recommended by former public protector Thuli Madonsela.He says he's extremely worried about Trillian s conduct with regards to Eskom and the Guptas, warning there's more than meets the eye around allegations of state capture.Initially, Sexwale appointed Advocate Geoff Budlender to conduct an independent investigation into Trillian, but he says Budlender doesn't have the powers to subpoena or summons anyone, and therefore believes a judicial inquiry is necessary.Last week, more details emerged of Trillian, along with Eskom, allegedly helping the Gupta's buy the Optimum coal mine, although this has been denied. Trillian CEO Eric Wood has been accused of having knowledge about the president's decision to fire finance minister Nhlanhla Nene before the move was made.It's also emerged that Trillian invoiced Eskom for millions of rands for little or no work being done, and that it used some of this money to help the Guptas pay for the Optimum mine.Sexwale says there's more than meets the eye when it comes to state capture. There is nothing being captured here, it s not about somebody taking things forcefully; this is about corruption and it s about state handover. So, I ll be sitting here in a company that I don t own I m going to spend hours on this thing that was not my plan, I m a business person. I invested here not to run court case or this huge Public Protector thing. Sexwale is leaving Trillian next month, saying he is a businessman and allegations of this nature is not what he signed up for.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
