PARLIAMENT - Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi says her department still needs to determine the impact of last week's High Court ruling on the procurement of nuclear energy.Last week the High Court in Western Court set aside five international agreements and a ministerial determination on nuclear energy ruling them unconstitutional and invalid.On Tuesday, Kubayi pledged to open the process to public debate and says her department is prepared to rectify procedural errors.Kubayi says taking over the Energy Department means she's inherited the good, the bad and the ugly.She insists there's no nuclear deal, least of all one with Russia, and says government will only have a nuclear framework in place by the end of the year.The Democratic Alliance s Gordon McKay says he still believes Parliament has either been deliberately misled or information has been withheld on government s procurement plans.But Kubayi has pledged to play open cards. We are very open with the process. We will definitely be clearly open about where we are doing things... and where there are weaknesses we will be upfront. Kubayi says last week's court ruling does not prohibit the country from pursuing its nuclear ambitions.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
