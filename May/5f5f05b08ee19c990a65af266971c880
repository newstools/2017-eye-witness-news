ZIMBABWE - State media in Zimbabwe is reporting that President Robert Mugabe has embarked on yet another foreign trip, this time to Mexico.The Zimbabwe president is attending a United Nations conference on disaster risk preparedness, but some Zimbabweans are suggesting he should have stayed at home.This conference is in Cancun and there are claims that Mugabe could be out of the country for another week.He only got back from a trip to see his doctors in Singapore last weekend.This is a conference about preparing for disasters and Zimbabwe's recent floods, particularly in the southern Tsholotsho district, have had disastrous effects on local livelihoods.As always, it's the cost of these overseas trips that get Zimbabweans worried, especially as the country's still in the grips of cash shortages.Nothing's being said so far about the plane Mugabe took to Mexico.
