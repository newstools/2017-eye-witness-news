Just days before by-elections in the area, three children were hit by a car yesterday afternoon while trying to cross the main road to reach the closest tap. DURBAN The African National Congress Women s League (ANCWL) President Bathabile Dlamini has visited two families whose children were killed while going to fetch water a few kilometres away from their home in Nquthu, in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN).The three children, aged between nine and 17, were hit by a car yesterday afternoon while trying to cross the main road to reach the closest tap.Rallies in the area have been halted as some residents place their special votes for the by-elections.KZN police say the driver of the vehicle has not been arrested and a case of culpable homicide has been opened.The mother of 17-year-old Zama Ngcobo and nine-year-old Ayanda Mazibuko cries inconsolably at the loss of her two children.Their neighbour s child Puse Buthelezi, who was 12-years-old, also died instantly while on their way collect water.KZN African National Congress chair Sihle Zikalala said: One of the things that they were going to fetch was water, and there is a feeling that if the family had water nearby this would not have happened. Service delivery in the Nquthu area has come to a standstill because of a failure to elect municipal leadership yesterday's tragedy is seen as one of the ramifications of this.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
