The ANC has described the move by the Premier Sylvia Lucas as a 'flagrant abuse of her office' to further divide the party. CAPE TOWN - Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas has come under fire from the African National Congress (ANC) after firing two MEC's, apparently without consulting the party.Lucas dismissed Finance MEC Mac Jack and Transport MEC Pauline Williams on Wednesday.The reshuffle is seen as a culling of enemies - ahead of a provincial elective conference this week.In a hard-hitting statement, the ANC has described the move by the Northern Cape premier as a flagrant abuse of her office to further divide the party. It says her unbridled arrogance is a betrayal of trust within the ANC, which deployed her as premier.The party also invoked a resolution from its 2007 Polokwane conference, that consultation with the ANC on deployment matters is a principle of the organisation - and not a favour.The reshuffle by Lucas has also been condemned by the party's Northern Cape executive committee which viewed its timing as suspicious.The PEC, which says it was not consulted, claims the shake-up is aimed at influencing the outcome of the provincial elective conference.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
