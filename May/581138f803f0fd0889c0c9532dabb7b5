What's that about?&quot;The committed atheist added: &quot;How dare you create a world to which there is such misery that is not our fault?&quot;According to the Irish Independent, the comment was originally reported to police in 2015. The complainant is said to have followed up last year, and to have received a phone call from a detective some weeks ago to discuss the case.The paper quoted a source as saying a prosecution was unlikely.
