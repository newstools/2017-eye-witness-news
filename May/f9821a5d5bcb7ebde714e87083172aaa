Officers arrested nine motorists at an illegal street racing operation in Plattekloof, Panorama and Milnerton. CAPE TOWN The City of Cape Town says traffic officials reacted to several illegal street races at various locations last night. Officers arrested nine motorists at an illegal street racing operation in Plattekloof, Panorama and Milnerton. Eight were charged with reckless and negligent driving, while a ninth was arrested for obstructing an officer in the execution of duty. Five vehicles were suspended for being unroadworthy. Member of Mayoral Council JP Smith said: This is a prime example of how we have to deploy resources to babysit people who couldn t be bothered to obey the law and put the lives of other road users at risk. &quot;There are legal gatherings at Killarney, where people with a passion for speed can have their fun in a safe and controlled environment instead of literally dicing with death on public roads.
