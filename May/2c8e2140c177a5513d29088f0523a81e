JOHANNESBURG - A scuffle has reportedly broken out between Black First Land First head Andile Mngxitama and Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) chairperson Yunus Carrim during public hearings on economic transformation.According to Fin24, Mngxitama had given a presentation titled The Malikane Proposals , which call on Parliament to create a new national economic plan based on the ideology of so-called radical economic transformation espoused by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba's adviser Chris Malikane.It s understood a scuffle broke out after Mngxitama started giving Carrim, a member of the communist party, a lecture on Marxism.Mngxitama was asked to leave the hearing after he called chair of the trade and industry committee Joan Fubbs a fascist.The Democratic Alliance's David Maynier watched the exchange and says Mngxitama acted deliberately. Well, he was under fire during question time. But at the end of the day I think his real purpose was to come to committee to provoke and to earn himself five minutes of fame on ANN7.
