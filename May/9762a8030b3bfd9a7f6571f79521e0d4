Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters during a service delivery protest on Monday afternoon. JOHANNESBURG - A two-week-old baby has died allegedly after inhaling tear gas during a protest at the Foreman Road informal settlement in Durban. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters during a service delivery protest on Monday afternoon. Community leader Mqapheli Bonono says several shacks filled up with tear gas where children started crying, coughing and vomiting - as some were unable to breathe. Bonono says baby Jayden Khoza was certified dead upon the ambulance's arrival and residents marched to the police station carrying his corpse. “One of the tear gases went through a shack and in that room there was a two-week-old child, the child couldn’t breathe and he passed away. The community got angry, went to the police with the body, saying it is the police’s responsibility.” Police's Thulani Zwane says they are investigating the incident. “We received a report that there was a two-week-old child who died, we don’t know what was the cause of the death and we are still waiting for the post-mortem.”
