Now the R21 towards the south is clear, traffic is flowing. But the R21 towards the north still has some debris on the road and the Sanral officers are busy clearing the road so that traffic can flow. One of the protesters says the community has had enough. They changed the demarcation to Ekurhuleni. So now we re in Ekurhuleni and then the landowner said they want to evict us. So that s what's causing the problem and we tried to take our crisis to the municipality but they don t respond. The police are expecting to make arrests soon and clear the road.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
