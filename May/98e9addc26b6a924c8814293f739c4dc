JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) says it believes Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo is doing the right thing in implementing a policy of encrypted digital terrestrial television because it will allow government to provide more services to people.Last week, Dlodlo confirmed to Eyewitness News that she would follow ANC policy on the issue after the party decided to go for an encrypted system.But former Communications Minister Faith Muthambi had refused to follow that policy and started implementing an unencrypted system.The SACP s Alex Mashilo says Dlodlo is on the right path.
