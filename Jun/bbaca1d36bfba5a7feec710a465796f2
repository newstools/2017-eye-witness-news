Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota says as soon as he caught Free State Premier Ace Magashule stealing public funds, he dismissed him. JOHANNESBURG - Free State Premier Ace Magashule says he won t dignify Mosiuoa Lekota s tweets about him with a response, while his spokesperson has described the Congress of the People (Cope) leader as dead wood that s desperate to be revived .But Lekota says he is sticking to his tweets, in which he says he caught Magashule stealing money from the public purse back in 1996.Lekota was premier of the province at the time, while Magashule was Economic Development MEC.Lekota says as soon as he caught Magashule stealing public funds, he dismissed him.But President Jacob Zuma, who in 1996 was the chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal, was deployed to solve the Magashule matter. Lekota says he was then asked to keep the matter under wraps but he refused.He says he wishes people such as Nelson Mandela were still alive as they would back him up. But now I m talking about things that people who were there when they happened have passed on. I don t want to make statements about people who ve passed on. Magashule s spokesperson Thabo Mmeko says Lekota will not be entertained. He doesn t deserve any tangible response, except to say we re not going to be part of a revival of an old, desperate wound in the field of politics. Lekota says South Africans should not allow Magashule to mislead them because he is corrupt to the core.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
