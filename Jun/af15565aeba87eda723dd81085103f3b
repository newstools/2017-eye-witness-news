There are 29 families who are refusing to have their loved ones moved for several reasons; some being that they are afraid because they don t trust the government after what happened. About 820 patients have been moved from these NGOs so far, with the Gauteng Health Department saying 20 NGOs have been shut down.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
