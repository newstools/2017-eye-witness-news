Owners of those cars built in India between August 2004 and March 2012 and sold in SA have been asked to 'immediately' contact a dealership. JOHANNESBURG - Ford South Africa has announced another fire-risk related recall, this time on its entry-level Figo and Ikon models.Owners of more than 15,000 petrol-engined Figos and Ikons built in India between August 2004 and March 2012 and sold in SA have received e-mails from the car maker asking them to immediately contact a Ford dealership to replace their vehicle's power-steering and high-pressure hose.Business Day is reporting that 16 of the affected vehicles have caught fire globally with no reports of incidents here in South Africa.In the e-mail to affected car owners Ford says there will be no charge for the replacement hose and labour costs but warns that while the process should take less than a day due to &quot;service scheduling requirements&quot; it could take longer. Owners are then &quot;respectfully reminded&quot; that Ford relies on its dealerships to provide customers with courtesy cars but &quot;this cannot be guaranteed&quot;.Ford has faced a backlash in recent months after nearly 50 of their Kuga's caught fire.
