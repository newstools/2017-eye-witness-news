The 24-year-old singer has revealed he doesn't feel able to escape attention, regardless of where he is in the world. LONDON - Former One Direction star Zayn Malik has admitted he can't go anywhere without being recognised. The 24-year-old singer - who is currently dating American model Gigi Hadid - has revealed he doesn't feel able to escape attention, regardless of where he is in the world. The former One Direction star explained: "It's a really weird world. I don't think there's anywhere I could be anonymous now." Zayn is largely able to slip under the radar during the early hours of the morning in New York City - but the respite is only temporary. Speaking to the Evening Standard newspaper, Zayn said: "In New York [where Gigi is based], you can sometimes get out in the early hours of the morning for a walk. "But there's no underground parking here, no escape routes. So they're going to get pictures, they're going to find you. In LA [his own usual US base], it's more catered to these things - you've got back entrances and that." As a result, Zayn admitted it's helpful that his girlfriend is also familiar with the stresses of fame. But the chart-topping singer insisted being well known has never been his main motivation. He shared: "Oh yes, definitely - she gets it, she's very understanding. But I can understand how it can look, that you've got these two people in a 'power couple'. That's not something I want to be a part of. I'm with her because I like her and I hope she's with me because she likes me." In fact, Zayn said that he and Gigi are just a "normal couple" behind closed doors. The hunky star said: "When we come home, we don't really talk about that s**t. We just spend time together as a normal couple, cook food, watch TV, have a laugh. I've got into a thing of cooking pies recently. I cook a mean chicken and sweetcorn pie, with Alfredo sauce. I make my own pastry, roll it out and everything."
