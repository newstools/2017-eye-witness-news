Khoza chaired Parliament's ad hoc committee that selected Busisiwe Mkhwebane to the Public Protector position. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Makhosi Khoza, says Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane's findings on the Reserve Bank are bizarre and that there was no interference from President Jacob Zuma or anyone else in their selection process.On Thursday night, Parliament announced it's going to court to challenge Mkhwebane's findings that the Reserve Bank's monetary policy mandate must change and that Absa must pay government over R1 billion because of an apartheid-era bailout.Both Absa and the Reserve Bank have already said they're also going to court.Khoza chaired Parliament's ad hoc committee that selected Mkhwebaneto the Public Protector position.She says the president played no role in this selection There was definitely no interference at that level; as you know, it was widely reported in the media that the person we all wanted was Judge [Siraj] Desai. She says that Mkhwebane's findings are literally bizarre. I really believe in the independence of the Reserve Bank and I think it was very irresponsible of her to make those kinds of pronouncements. When we ve entered an economic technical recession, she makes pronouncements that may result in thousands of jobs. It s really bizarre actually. The ANC MP says Mkhwebane s findings that the monetary policy mandate of the Reserve Bank must change are irresponsible and could result in thousands of people losing their jobs.Khosa says she can't believe that Mkhwebane made the findings that she did.But she says the process she led can't be held responsible because it was completely transparent. It s very difficult to know how a person would behave or to know who will influence this person going forward. We are not sangomas [traditional healers], we can t predict that. Khoza adds Mkhwebane was actually first nominated to the post by the Inkatha Freedom Party.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
