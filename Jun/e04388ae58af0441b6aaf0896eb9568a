Zille faces disciplinary action as well as suspension from the party over her colonialism tweets. She will, however, remain Premier of the Western Cape. CAPE TOWN - Helen Zille should have retired when she vacated her position as the Democratic Alliance's (DA) leader.Political Analyst Daniel Silke made the comment in light of the recent friction in the party.Zille faces disciplinary action as well as suspension from the party over her colonialism tweets. She will, however, remain Premier of the Western Cape, no matter the outcome of these processes.DA leader Mmusi Maimane says while he was offended by the tweets he reiterated he doesn't believe Zille is racist.He, however, has stated he and Zille have disagreed on the direction the party needs to take in the run up to the 2019 general elections.A number of opposition parties have since called for the removal of Zille from her provincial position.Silke has described the DA's handling of the matter as clumsy. And it probably proves the point once again that when you have been a former leader of a political party, its best to vacate office or retire - rather than be later seen to be in conflict with your successor or a new generation of young leadership that takes over. And I think largely that is what we have seen happen emerging within the DA. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
