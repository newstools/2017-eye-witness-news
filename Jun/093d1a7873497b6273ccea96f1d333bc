A complaint of intimation against Prince was lodged with the police this week after the councillor was recorded apparently saying he would kill Roelof van Staden. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC)'s Western Cape executive committee is set to discuss the latest allegations against party councillor Truman Prince. A complaint of intimation against Prince was lodged with the police this week after the councillor was recorded apparently saying he would kill Beaufort West acting municipal manager Roelof van Staden. The former Beaufort West mayor is also being investigated by the council speaker, but Prince reportedly claims his comments were taken out of context. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs says he has spoken to Prince and cautioned him about &quot;emotional&quot; outbursts. We are calling on our councillors, our public reps to be exemplary and ensure that we indeed serve our people in that community. The matter has been serviced to me. I will process it in the organisation and we will deal with it. The PEC will meet next week.
