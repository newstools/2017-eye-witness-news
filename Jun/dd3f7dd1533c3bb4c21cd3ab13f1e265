Dhlomo has come under fire over the inactive machines used to provide radiotherapy treatment for cancer patients and for mismanaging the shortage of oncologists in KZN. DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu says he doesn't believe Provincial Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo should be axed over the health crisis affecting cancer patients.Dhlomo has come under fire over the inactive machines used to provide radiotherapy treatment for cancer patients and for mismanaging the shortage of oncologists in KZN.The crisis dates back five years to a contractual dispute between the department and a maintenance company tasked with servicing equipment.The Human Rights Commission has also completed its investigation and has found cancer patients rights to life and dignity were violated by the provincial Health Department.Government has conceded that internal controls within the health department are weak due to capacity and the provincial treasury will now intervene.But Mchunu says the blame cannot be placed solely on Dhlomo. First of all, I must satisfy myself, was there a dereliction of duty on the part of the MEC which I haven t established? (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
