JOHANNESBURG - In the latest in the so-called Gupta leaked emails, it s been reported that former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene s name was used by a business associate of the controversial family related to Transnet s locomotive deal.Various newspaper reports, citing the leaked mails, claim that a letter was written in Nene s name and addressed to the China Development Bank board s chairperson in January 2015.Nene has called the letter a fabrication.He says that the letter could not have come from his office, adding that he s baffled about how it ended up in the hands of Gupta associates.Leaked emails have revealed that the letter was written by a senior economic advisor working for an investment company that was involved in the now-controversial Transnet locomotive procurement project.The project was worth over R50 billion and the Guptas allegedly received over R5 billion in kickbacks.The letter ended up with Guptas-owned Sahara Computers chief executive Ashu Chawla.The Gupta employee s name has consistently come up in the recent leaked emails, showing interference or associations with government departments or state-owned entities.Earlier this month, an AmaBhungane and Scorpio expose revealed how Zuma's friends and their associates were allegedly diverting billions of rand from Transnet s purchase of locomotives to their offshore accounts.Read more on the expose here.
