Mthethwa was found guilty of beating to death 23-year-old sex worker Nokuphila Kumalo and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. JOHANNESBURG An attempt by convicted murder Zwelethu Mthethwa to avoid jail time was struck down in the Western Cape High Court.Mthethwa was found guilty of beating to death 23-year-old sex worker Nokuphila Kumalo and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment last month.His lawyer William Booth brought an application for leave to appeal both the sentence and conviction but it was dismissed on Friday.Booth says he filed various documents to support their argument that another court would overturn the standing verdict. The test that is laid down in our law is whether or not there is a reasonable prospect of success, and whether or not another court may come to another decision. The judge felt that wouldn t be the case and ruled against Mr Mthethwa.
