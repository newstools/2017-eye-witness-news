The Chamber of Mines says that if the new charter was to be adopted, it would result in thousands of people losing their jobs. JOHANNESBURG - The Chamber of Mines has now lodged the first of its legal papers in an urgent application to stop Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane from implementing the new Mining Charter.Ten days ago, Zwane announced the details of the new charter but the chamber says he did not consult with them and those new proposals have now been included in the document.It also says that if the new charter was to be adopted, it would result in thousands of people losing their jobs.The Chamber of Mines has now lodged its notice of motion saying that it wants a court date on an urgent basis to argue that this charter cannot be implemented.It says that its argument can be summed up to say that the new charter represents an egregious case of regulatory overreach and that the act of its publication was harmful because of its vague and contradictory language.The chamber also says that there has been vast and systemic damage to the mining industry and the interests of its members, and to the country as a whole.As such, the body has told the court it needs urgent redress and the only way to do this is through a court order.Last week, Minister Zwane said he was open to talks with companies over the new Mining Charter.However, he also rebuked the mining firms for planning to take the new rules to court, saying they were negotiating in bad faith .The charter raises the threshold for black ownership in the mining industry to 30% and bringing in other regulations the sector says it cannot afford.
