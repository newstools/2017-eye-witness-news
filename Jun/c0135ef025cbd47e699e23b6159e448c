This year we are consolidating grade 11, we are now bringing them on the paperless platform and in 2018 we will then bring our grade 9 and 10. We are on track to ensure that all our schools in the townships are on a paperless platform so that our children can compete with the best across the globe. Lesufi says theft and vandalism is still a major challenge in Gauteng schools. Since the installation of paperless classrooms the level of thuggery and vandalism has taken an ugly turn and we are worried. We are calling on the police to assist us, but we are not going to be deterred by this kind of thing.
