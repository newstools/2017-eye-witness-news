The Democratic Alliance has now joined Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and Eskom in Molefe&#8217;s Labour Court battle to have his job back as CEO. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) is heading to the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday morning to have certain aspects of the case relating to Brian Molefe s reappointment as Eskom CEO postponed pending the outcome of his Labour Court battle.Molefe s case was supposed to be heard in the Labour Court on Monday following his decision to fight his dismissal, however, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and Eskom are yet to file their answering affidavits.Molefe s return was cut short at the power utility last week when the minister announced that his controversial appointment as CEO was being rescinded.The DA has now joined Brown and Eskom in Molefe s Labour Court battle to have his job back as CEO.Initially, the main opposition approached the High Court in a legal bid to have Molefe s reappointment set aside.It has now joined the Labour Court proceedings, saying that it wants to ensure that the former Eskom CEO doesn t return to the power utility.In his court application, Molefe argues that his removal was unlawful, adding that politics and misconduct were to blame for his axing.He also says he would need to have his job back in order to fight the DA s legal case against him.It s not yet clear when the Labour Court case will be heard.GUPTA HELPING HANDLast month it emerged how Molefe helped the Guptas grab a mine.In an amaBhungane exclusive on EWN, former Mineral Resources Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi revealed how the Guptas managed to secure the Optimum Coal mine from Glencore in 2015 at a time when Molefe was in constant contact with the controversial family.AmaBhungane s Sam Sole said Molefe played an integral part in this &quot;forced sale&quot;. In the meantime, Molefe comes in as the CEO and really is instrumental in putting on the squeeze on Glencore to the extent that they eventually back down and sell the mine to the Guptas. Ramatlhodi said he refused to suspend all of Glencore s South African mining licenses as Molefe and Eskom chairperson Ben Ngubane had insisted.Ramatlhodi said he was fired as mineral resources minister shortly after this and replaced by Mosebenzi Zwane, a known Gupta associate.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
