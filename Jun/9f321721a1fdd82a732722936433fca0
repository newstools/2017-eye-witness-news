JOHANNESBURG Telkom SA, South Africa s biggest landline provider, reported a rise in full-year earnings and revenue on Monday, buoyed by a strong performance by its mobile business and its Business Connexion enterprise division.With the completion of a turnaround plan, which aimed to bring down costs, including job cuts, and better compete with wireless operators, the company s focus on growth under Chief Executive Sipho Maseko shows signs it is paying off.Telkom, in which the government owns a stake of about 40%, said headline earnings per share for the year-ended March rose 12.4% to 731.4 cents from 650.9 in the comparable period last year. I am pleased with our solid performance, which was boosted by the integration of BCX (Business Connexion Group) and the robust performance of our Mobile business, Maseko said in a statement.Telkom, whose core business is providing fixed and mobile phone lines and data, bought BCX for R2.6 billion ($202.48 million) in 2015, seven years after competition concerns scrapped its first bid.

Mobile active subscriber numbers grew by 47.7% to approximately 4 million. This was a result of an expansion in our network, extension of our distribution channels and the launch of innovative products, Maseko said, referring to Telkom s mobile arm, initially known as 8ta, launched in 2010.Telkom has been looking to boost its mobile business, launched in 2010, to offset the falling use of landlines.
