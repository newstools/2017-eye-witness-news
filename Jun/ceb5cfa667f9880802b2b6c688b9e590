CAPE TOWN - The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it will deliver a compelling document detailing the extent of South Africa's alleged state capture to Parliament on Wednesday.Outa says the move aims to ensure Parliamentarians are well informed ahead of the vote on a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.The document's seven chapters are based on Outa's own investigation and reports by the Public Protector, the Council of Churches and the Public Affairs Research Institute. Details contained in the leaked Gupta-emails have also been included.Outa's Wayne Duvenage says they have &quot;connected the dots&quot; of state capture.&quot;The first step is to present this to Parliament, asking them to introduce it as a debate in Parliament so that all the MPs are now advised and informed with compelling evidence of state capture.&quot; He adds Outa believes this will provide Parliamentarians with enough information &quot;to vote with their conscience&quot; to remove President Jacob Zuma. If we ve partially aided to that decision being taken and the President is removed, our job is done. If that doesn't happen, well, there are a number of steps that we will have to take after that. He says taking the document to the Constitutional Court may be one such step.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
