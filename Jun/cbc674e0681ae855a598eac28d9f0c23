BLF says the cases relate to the alleged mismanagement of R4.3 billion under their watch at Treasury. JOHANNESBURG - Black First Land First (BLF) says it will ask police to open criminal cases on Friday against former Finance Ministers Pravin Gordhan and Nhlanhla Nene. BLF says the cases relate to the alleged mismanagement of R4.3 billion under their watch at Treasury. The organisation's leader Andile Mngxitama says he will submit a sworn affidavit to police in Johannesburg on multiple transgressions . Mngxitama, who has been implicated in the Gupta leaks saga, has denied asking for funding from the Gupta family.&quot;No, that's absolute nonsense based on a clearly coordinated strategy to attack whoever is opposed to white monopoly capital.&quot;Gordhan was reappointed as Finance Minister in December 2015 after President Jacob Zuma fired Nene. Gordhan was himself fired earlier this year as Zuma reshuffled his Cabinet.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
