Mooody's senior analyst Zuzana Brixiova explains how low business confidence could impact South Africa. JOHANNESBURG - The steep decline in South Africa's business confidence is a setback to economic growth recovery and will dampen investment, ratings agency Moody's said on Monday.South African business confidence fell in the second quarter to a level not seen since the 2009 recession, a survey showed last week, as concerns over politics weighed.&quot;Reduced business confidence implies reduced investment, which would negatively affect growth in South Africa s already-weak economy, and will ultimately make fiscal consolidation more challenging,&quot; Moody's senior analyst Zuzana Brixiova said in a research note.&quot;Without improved trust in policymaking, it is likely that South Africa will remain in a low-growth trap,&quot; Brixiova said.South Africa entered recession for the first time in eight years in the first quarter, data showed on 6 June, putting pressure on the government just as it must cope with credit downgrades.Moody's lowered South Africa's rating to the bottom of the investment grade table with a negative outlook on 9 June, citing a recent abrupt cabinet reshuffle and reduced growth prospects for the economy.S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch rate South Africa as &quot;junk&quot;.Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Thursday the Treasury was looking for ways to cut government spending further and reallocate funds to help boost growth while maintaining its fiscal target.WATCH: Gigaba: My priority is to stabilise the economy
