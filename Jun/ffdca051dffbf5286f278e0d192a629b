CAPE TOWN - An ANC faction in the Western Cape is still hoping that the party's national leadership will overturn a PEC decision to disband the Cape Town region's leadership.The Dullar Omar regional executive committee was dissolved, apparently because of insubordination, its apparent inability to serve the region and alleged factionalism.However the group - which has been supported by leadership of other regions in the province - claims that this is part of a factional battle linked to the national presidency.The disgruntled group was hoping that the matter would be tabled at Tuesday's special NEC meeting but it is understood the Western Cape's problems were not discussed.ANC PEC member and central Karoo secretary Windy Plaatjies says his region does not recognise the decision which he claims was taken after a meeting collapsed.&quot;Why will he convene it on a WhatsApp group, knowing that some of the members are not part of that group? Therefore I am distancing myself.&quot;Provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs is sticking by the decision.&quot;There's no faction, there's no malice. It's a purely organisational decision.&quot;Some within the ANC's provincial structures have warned the internal squabbles could further split an already divided PEC if the national leadership fails to act.
