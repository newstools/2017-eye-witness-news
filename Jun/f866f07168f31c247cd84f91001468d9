Amnesty International says it s documented a pattern of arbitrary arrests and detentions of opposition party members, journalists, human rights defenders and members of the Lesotho Defence Force since 2014. Amnesty International is saying that as a result of past impunities that we have seen in the country, these include the killing of Maaparankoe Mahao, so as the new government assumes power we are calling on authorities to act on the past human rights violations that have characterised Lesotho in the past few years.
