There was a lot of paper but we didn t have to go through that, we were just asked to give the passports within a few days the work permits were stamped and given out, no questions asked. Apleni noted the allegations against some immigrations officials. The right thing we have done is to go to those officials who are named and say here are the allegations against you, what do you know about this ? Based on that, we can deal with the matter. He says he will report back on the outcome of the investigation.The amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism is an independent non-profit. Be an amaB supporter to help it do more.
