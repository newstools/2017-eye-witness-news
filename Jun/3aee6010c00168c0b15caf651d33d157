The Panel on the Assessment of Key Legislation and Acceleration of Fundamental Change was holding a round-table discussion in Parliament. CAPE TOWN - The organisation Ndifuna Ukwazi claims housing in Cape Town continues to be developed along racial lines, locking black and coloured people into areas far from the city centre.The NGO was briefing a panel chaired by Former President Kgalema Motlanthe in Parliament.The High-Level Panel on the Assessment of Key Legislation and Acceleration of Fundamental Change held a round-table discussion in Parliament, focusing on people's unequal access to urban land.Ndifuna Ukwazi s Hopolang Sebelalo says most black and coloured poor and working class people still live in crowded, poorly serviced areas on the margins of the Mother City and these apartheid spatial patterns are being reinforced by new developments located in far-flung areas. Well located state land that could be used for affordable housing either lies vacant, is under-utilised or is sold off. Just to note that not a single affordable housing unit has been built in the inner city since 1994. The Human Sciences Research Council s Professor Ivan Turok has told the panel that government policies are entrenching unequal access to land across the country, instead of easing the problem.Turok says workers spend between 20% or 30% of their monthly income on transport costs, a burden that the location of their homes forces on them.The panel heard from experts on how to address the question of access to urban land.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
