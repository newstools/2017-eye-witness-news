The stalwart's are boycotting the first two days of the policy conference as it no longer includes a consultative gathering. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts say the party has failed to take action following the Gupta emails and says Minister Jeff Radebe should have been disciplined for his sexting scandal.The stalwarts are boycotting the first two days of the policy conference as it no longer includes a consultative gathering.ANC stalwart Cheryl Carolous says it's important to acknowledge that the ANC has brought forward some of the most progressive policies globally.She, however, says today's ANC needs to explain all that s going wrong, saying those linked to the Gupta emails need to explain and be disciplined.She says there s a lack of accountability. Why is that one of the members of the president s Cabinet, appointed by him, can ask a woman to send a picture of her genitals to him on a phone and there are no consequences? The stalwarts say they'd like to see the party revived.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
