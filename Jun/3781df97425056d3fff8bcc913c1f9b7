New information revealed in leaked emails suggests that Mosebenzi Zwane made the trip from Zurich to Dubai on a flight sponsored by the Gupta family. CAPE TOWN - The Public Protector and Parliament are being asked to probe whether Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane deliberately misled Members of Parliament (MPs).The Democratic Alliance (DA) has sent a complaint to Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane s office and Parliament s ethics watchdog, asking them to investigate.Zwane stated in a written response to a recent parliamentary question that his department organised and paid for a trip he took to Dubai in December 2015. But this doesn't tally with information that's emerged in the leaked Gupta emails.According to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report, Zwane did not use the ticket bought for him by the Department of Mineral Resources to travel from Zurich to Dubai.New information revealed in leaked emails suggests that Zwane made the trip on a flight sponsored by the Gupta family.DA MP James Lorimer says the minister appears to have deliberately misled Parliament , which is against the law.Lorimer says intentionally misleading Parliament and misrepresenting information are serious offences.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
