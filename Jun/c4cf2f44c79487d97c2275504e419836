Mineral Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says the charter is an instrument for radical economic change in the mining sector and will increase more black participation. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the release of the mining charter on Thursday is proof that the African National Congress (ANC) government doesn t care about long-term and sustainable transformation in the mining sector.The party says Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has opened the doors to more ANC crony enrichment and that the charter will be a disaster for the mining industry.Zwane says the charter is an instrument for radical economic change in the mining sector and will increase more black participation.The opposition party says one way of diversifying the mining sector would be to bring mine workers into mining schemes.DA shadow minister of mineral resources James Lorimer said: The new version of the mining charter is proof that the ANC government doesn t care about the long-term and sustainable transformation. What it will do is it will dry up investment in mining, and that means it will dry up jobs. I predict tens of thousands of people will lose their jobs. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
