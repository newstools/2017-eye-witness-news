We were heading down a pretty good path and it was disappointing not to get a result in the end, said Smith. The game against England is now a quarter-final as such. They re a good side and the equation is pretty simple now.

Australia were unlucky and we are lucky to still be in the tournament. We have to play hard again, but we beat New Zealand in Ireland (in a warm-up match) so you never know, added Bangladesh skipper Mortaza.
