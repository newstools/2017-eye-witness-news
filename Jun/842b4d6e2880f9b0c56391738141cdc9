JOHANNESBURG A committee set up to look into the tragedy involving mental patients at Life Esidimeni is expected to outline the progress it has made in implementing the recommendations by the Health Ombudsman following the tragedy in which more than a hundred mentally ill patients died.In October 2015, then Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu announced that the provincial government s contract with the Life Esidimeni was being terminated.While many were moved to unregistered NGOs, an investigation has revealed that most patients died due to negligence and improper care.Mahlangu resigned shortly before the report was made public.PATIENT RELOCATION PROCESSLast month, Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said that 91% of eligible patients have been moved from improper mental health facilities, since the tragedy.She said that the department has made inroads in addressing all the ombudsman's recommendations.The MEC says the first relocations following the report began in March this year. All patients, except where there are disputes or misunderstandings, have been relocated. Thus, over 91% of eligible patients have been removed and relocated from NGOs today. She says as of April this year, 750 patients were transferred to three facilities that are capable of taking care of them. Selby Park facility received 390 patients, Baneng facility received 232 patients and Waverley Care Centre received 128 patients. Ramokgopa says the previous senior officials of the department implicated in the report have appealed the findings which has paused the disciplinary process.
