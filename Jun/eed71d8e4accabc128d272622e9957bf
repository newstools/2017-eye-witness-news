Each player is ranked according to the contribution they are expected to make over the next 12 months.All-rounder Doug Bracewell and offspinner Mark Craig dropped off the list, while wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi announced his retirement from international cricket on Thursday. Colin made a breakthrough last summer and is rated well in all three formats, NZC selector Gavin Larsen said in a statement. Jeet s test numbers speak for themselves, and Neil, as well as averaging 43 in ODI cricket since his recall, is also seen as viable cover for the test team s middle-order. Bracewell barely played any cricket last season when he suffered a serious knee injury and recently was convicted for drink driving. Doug is still viewed very positively by the selectors and has a big year in front of him in terms of bouncing back from his injury and proving his worth, said Larsen. Its been a difficult time for him since the knee injury but we re all hopeful he ll make a full and sustainable recovery.
