Committee chairperson Mireille Wenger says it's unacceptable because police stations in crime hotspots are most affected. CAPE TOWN - National and Western Cape police management have been lashed by members of the Western Cape Legislature over inadequate resourcing.On Wednesday, officials briefed the Legislature's standing committee on community safety.It emerged that the Western Cape is one of the most poorly resourced provinces.The Western Cape SAPS had nearly 21,000 administrative and operational employees in 2013.The current figure is just over 20,000.Committee chairperson Mireille Wenger says it's unacceptable because police stations in crime hotspots are most affected. There s not enough visible police to patrol all the sectors. In Steenberg which sector does not get patrolled? It's Lavender Hill, so there s clearly a resource problem and the big question is how are you going to fix this? ACDP MPL Ferlon Christians says this leaves communities vulnerable. If I go to Menenberg and all those areas, people are living in fear. It s like a warzone and gangsters are taking control of our communities. Western Cape police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula acknowledged the short staffing but warned there's no correlation between an increase in resources and the reduction of crime.
