On Friday President Jacob Zuma called on the former ANC soldiers to discuss how they could defend their country with their expertise. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) military veterans association says it wants the county's national key points to be guarded by former freedom fighters and not companies from outside the country. On Friday President Jacob Zuma called on the former ANC soldiers to discuss how they could defend their country with their expertise, urging them to protect the revolution against those who wanted to steal it.Zuma spoke about the commercialisation of security and sounded concerned that government allowed people from all over the world to start security companies in the country. Some security companies who are here ought to know better, I can t say what I wanted to say because there are friends here, but you get my point. MKMVA President Kebby Maphatsoe says it must be former MKs who protect the country. Allowing companies of former freedom fighters to be the ones that are protecting or guarding the national key points because of their expertise and their patriotism. On Friday, the president did not talk further about security issues, citing the media presence. But that's before he called on the former soldiers to defend the revolution, saying he did not want it to be taken away from revolutionaries.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
