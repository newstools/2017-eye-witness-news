Provincial chair Sihle Zikalala also says there would not be a need for elections if there was a tradition that the deputy president takes over from the incumbent. DLANGEZWA - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says it has emerged from its general council denouncing talks about divisions, saying it s ready for the policy conference this week.Provincial chair Sihle Zikalala also says there would not be a need for elections if there was a tradition that the deputy president takes over from the incumbent.He was speaking at the closing ceremony of the region s general council held at the University of Zululand at the weekend.Last week, the KZN ANC told Eyewitness News the province is divided over names to be thrown into the presidential race with three candidates being touted to lead the organisation.On the first day of the congress, Zikalala admitted to divisions in the province, promising to resolve this ahead of the policy conference this week.But during the closing of the conference on Sunday, Zikalala downplayed this. Those were analysts who have always been projecting the KwaZulu-Natal ANC is divided, as pieces that will be taken by anyone, would draw conclusions from this PGC that we still remain an ANC in KwaZulu-Natal which emerges as a collective. Earlier, Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize pleaded with delegates to restore unity saying divisions in the province have an impact at a national level.At the same time, the ANC says calls for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over as president because of tradition are devoid of analysis of the kind of leadership the party needs.During the opening and closing of the congress, delegates expressed their support for President Jacob Zuma through song.Zikalala says principles should inform how members elect its leadership. We understand that only as an unwritten principle of the movement. But in addition to such unwritten tradition, the leadership elections should be driven by the strategic task of the moment and quality of the available pool of leadership. Meanwhile, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe has urged ANC members to remain loyal to the party's values to build a more prosperous South Africa.Radebe was delivering the OR Tambo Memorial Lecture on Sunday afternoon in Sedibeng.The minister spoke on what it takes to be a selfless cadre.Radebe said ANC members should strive for an equal, non-racial society, which Oliver Tambo's wish for the country. What we learned from President OR is that the ANC cadre must be loyal to nothing but the cause of the revolution as championed through our revolutionary movement and guided by our revolutionary theory.
