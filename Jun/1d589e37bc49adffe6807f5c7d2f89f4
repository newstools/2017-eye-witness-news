Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has already submitted a motion for a state capture investigation. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) is pushing for Parliament to establish an ad hoc committee into state capture.DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says he will submit a draft resolution to the chief whip's forum on Wednesday in an attempt to reach a multi-party consensus to have the motion put on the agenda of the house before it goes into recess at the end of the month.DA leader Mmusi Maimane already submitted a motion for a state capture investigation two weeks ago.Steenhuisen says it would be preferable for all parties to agree to investigate the barrage of claims.The call by the DA follows recently leaked emails between the Gupta family and their employees, which apparently shows how the family obtained business from government.The City Press had reported that the family pulled favours with senior officials with a plan to move President Jacob Zuma and his family to Dubai.It s understood that the emails reveal how the controversial family lured senior government officials to take over departments and state-owned entities.The content of the emails apparently includes a draft letter from Zuma addressed to Abu Dhabi crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, in which he asks for patronage in his bid to make the United Arab Emirates a second home.Mineral Resource Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has also been featured in the emails.His CV was allegedly sent to the Guptas for consideration two months before being appointed to the position.The Gupta family responded to the reports based on internal e-mails, labelling the reports as fake news.LISTEN: Guptas want documents for own probe into leaked e-mails(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
