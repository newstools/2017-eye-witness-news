The Economist Intelligence Unit has found that lifestyle-related problems are already causing serious illness in children. JOHANNESBURG - International researchers are predicting that today s children will be less healthy when they retire, compared to the current generation of people over 60.Having conducted surveys in countries including South Africa, Germany and Saudi Arabia, the Economist Intelligence Unit has found that lifestyle-related problems are already causing serious illness in children.Experts gathered in Darmstadt, Germany for the 'Global Consumer Health Debate' recently to discuss current trends and prevention methods. Major changes are needed in both lifestyle and environment if today s children are expected to live past 65, said research director at the Economist Intelligence Unit, Aviva Freudmann.She warned that children who led a sedentary life were prone to obesity which could later manifest in depression and isolation.Among the unit s chief findings is that in cases where a parent was overweight, their children were more likely to follow suit.The Vienna Institute of Demography lists biology, lifestyle, gender and social status as the main determinants of life expectancy. Smoking is the most important single risk factor which has the highest impact on longevity and healthy life expectancy , said the institute s Dr Marc Luy.Researchers say child obesity around the world is not being given the attention it deserves and is not being addressed with the urgency needed to curb chronic disease.Nutritionists at the conference lauded schools for rolling out vital feeding schemes in impoverished communities. However, they warned that institutions were fast becoming vehicles used to feed children, without explaining nutrition, meaning pupils entered adolescence without a full picture of what their bodies required to thrive.The Economist Intelligence Unit has found that South Africa s life expectancy is lagging behind compared to other countries.The key here, they say, is for government, parents and teachers to ask what needs to be done now, to try and ensure the next generation is able to live to 100 years.
