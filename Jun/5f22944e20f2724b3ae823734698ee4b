The Eskom board chair, who was implicated in the State of Capture report, has resigned from his position with immediate effect. JOHANNESBURG The African National Congress s (ANC) study group on public enterprises says it believes Ben Ngubane's resignation is simply an attempt to avoid being held accountable for his role in recent events at Eskom.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown announced last night that Ngubane has stepped down.Ngubane was named in the public protector's State of Capture report, as well as in the recently leaked Gupta emails.The ANC study group's Zukiswa Rantho says they re concerned about the role he played in the controversial re-appointment of Brian Molefe as Eskom chief executive officer. Maybe he is running away from the responsibility that he has to take. We still have a number of questions that he has not answered on the reappointment of Brian Molefe and the impact that had in the governance of Eskom.
