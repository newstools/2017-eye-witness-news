Speaker of the council postponed a meeting scheduled to elect a new mayor after Michael Holestein was ousted last week following a motion of no confidence in him. JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng government says it will consider dissolving the Mogale City Municipality if the stand-off between the African National Congress (ANC) and Democratic Alliance (DA) led coalition councillors isn t resolved soon.On Wednesday morning the speaker of the council postponed a meeting scheduled to elect a new mayor after Michael Holestein was ousted last week following a motion of no confidence in him.The speaker said over 30 councillors were absent and the meeting could not constitute a quorum.Holestein was ousted with 39 votes in favour of the motion of no confidence, with 38 councillors voting against it and one councillor dissenting.The ANC has 38 seats in the council while the DA-led coalition has 39.The DA s Gauteng Spokesperson Annika Scheepers has confirmed their councillors have had lie detector tests to see who voted with the opposition.But she says they volunteered for the tests. DA councillors volunteered for a polygraph because they are determined to make good on the project of change in Mogale. It also confirmed one of its councillors in the municipality resigned following the tests.ANC deputy chairperson in the West Rand Mzi Khumalo said: Indeed it is disappointing. Today we were supposed to deal with for instance the issue of the budget and the IDP, as key issues. The issue of the election of the mayor was part of the agenda but it was not that big, the issue there is that we need that municipality to work. Meanwhile, Gauteng local government spokesperson Mogomotsi Mogodiri says if the council doesn t get its house in order the NEC will dissolve it. If the NEC will be compelled to stepping in, it will be putting that municipality under administration. That would lead to a by-election for the entire municipality.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
