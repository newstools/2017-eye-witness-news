Witch Hunt. But Sekulow said that Trump was reacting to a Washington Post story that said special counsel Robert Mueller was examining whether Trump had tried to obstruct the probe by firing FBI director James Comey in May. The fact of the matter is the president has not been and is not under investigation, Sekulow said on CBS' Face the Nation, one of four political shows where he appeared on Sunday. There has been no notification from the special counsel s office that the president is under investigation, Sekulow said.Mueller, the special counsel named by the Justice Department to probe the Russia matter, is investigating whether anyone associated with Trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin.Mueller is also looking at whether, if any potential offences were committed, Trump or others attempted to cover them up or obstruct the investigation into them, said one U.S. official on Thursday who is familiar with the rough outlines of the probe and who spoke on condition of anonymity.
