Last month, when Brown ordered the board to rescind the controversial reappointment of Brian Molefe, she stated she would appoint an acting CEO within 48 hours.She also asked for two names to be considered for his replacement.The minister says even before Brian Molefe was re-appointed, several executives had already applied for the job.On Friday, following the utility's annual general meeting, Brown explained that it was a complex process and she wanted to find someone who wasn't conflicted by having applied for the job in the past or having appeared in the media.Brown says she believes she's made a good choice by appointing Dladla. I wanted to give South Africa somebody who wasn t conflicted by having applied for the job, that hasn t been named in anyway, in any newspaper, or any media, anything like that. And I think I ve made a very good choice. I also wanted someone who could actually run a company. Brown also appointed four new board members, whom she has described as young scientists,who have &quot;green&quot; experience, one of them has also studied nuclear energy.She also announced the re-appointment of interim chair Zethembe Khoza.Brown also says she's asked Eskom's new leadership to immediately address several problems.She says it's been a difficult time for Eskom in recent years but believes the parastatal is doing better financially. I ve asked Eskom s new leadership, to roll up its collective sleeves and immediately address three issues of primary importance: the management of contracts, conflicts of interest and the quality of coal supply to Eskom.
