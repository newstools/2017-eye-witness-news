Sdumo Dlamini has apologised for making statements that have caused confusion around Cosatu&#8217;s calls for the President Jacob Zuma to step down. JOHANNESBURG - Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) President Sdumo Dlamini has warned there are likely to be casualties as the federation intensifies its calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down, saying someone may be killed in the process. Dlamini was delivering his closing address at the federation s last day of its central committee meeting in Tshwane. He s apologised to the delegates for attending the president s birthday party and making statements that have caused confusion around Cosatu s calls for the president to step down.Dlamini says after Cosatu took the decision that President Zuma must step down something happened at his KwaZulu-Natal home. When we opened the kitchen door, outside we found a dead cat whose head had been decapitated and its abdominal content disembowelled and thrown at the front door of our house. I understand exactly why and what that message means. He s warning there s likely to be collateral damage as Cosatu calls for the president to step down. Tomorrow it s not going to be a cat, it s going to be a human being. There will be those causalities, let s be clear on that. Dlamini told Cosatu unions to be ready for battle.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
