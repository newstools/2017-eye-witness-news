Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown directed the Eskom board to rescind its decision to reinstate Molefe as the utility's CEO, as per the recommendations by the inter-ministerial committee. JOHANNESBURG - Brian Molefe, the man who's been credited for turning Eskom around, is without a job once again, raising questions about what his next move will be.On Wednesday, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown directed the Eskom board to rescind its decision to reinstate Molefe as the utility's CEO, as per the recommendations by the inter-ministerial committee which she is part of.Since Molefe's appointment in 2015, allegations of state capture and his dodgy deals with the Guptas have emerged.When the Public Protector's State of Capture report implicated Brian Molefe and particularly his relationship with the Guptas he was devastated, becoming teary and emotional at a press conference last year.He stepped down in the interests of good governance and to ensure he could clear his name.Last year, Eskom chairperson Ben Ngubane came to Molefe's defense.&quot;Thuli Madonsela has struck a deadly blow against Eskom. If we lose Brian, she will taste the blame.&quot;Molefe received a hero's welcome when he returned to his position earlier this month.&quot;Thank you very much for the warm welcome. I just want to reiterate that we must keep the lights on.&quot;But yesterday, the inter-ministerial committee announced that Eskom made major concessions about his appointment and Minister Lynne Brown is now looking at replacing him in the next two days.Molefe recently resigned as a Member of Parliament and there are now reports that he's been tipped for the position of Treasury director-general.Questions are now being asked about whether he'll return to politics or simply retire.
