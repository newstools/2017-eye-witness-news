Malusi Gigaba says government has to intensify its programmes to grow the economy and must improve confidence urgently. CAPE TOWN - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says if economic growth does not pick up the government's ability to raise revenue or borrow money will be limited.He was replying to debate in the National Assembly on the Appropriation Bill, which provides for the allocation of funds to state departments.The debate comes after the economy was officially declared to be in recession on Tuesday, after a further contraction in GDP was recorded.Gigaba says this puts more pressure on the government.The finance minister says the possibility of sustained low growth over the medium term is the biggest threat to the government s budget plans. The prospect of sustained low growth over the medium term remains the greatest risk to our fiscal policy objectives, and limits government s ability to generate more revenue or sustain higher levels of debt to finance its existing commitments. He says the government has to intensify its programmes to grow the economy and must improve confidence as a matter of urgency .Gigaba says the contraction in the economy, which has plunged the country into its second recession in less than 10 years, is a setback but that people should not become despondent and rather work together to bring about growth.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
