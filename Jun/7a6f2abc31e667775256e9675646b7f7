The school area is again safe. The troops are in pursuit mode.&quot;Witnesses about a kilometre from the school said they could hear gunfire. Troops were preventing anyone from getting closer.A police report said about 300 armed men, among them members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), stormed the school early on Wednesday. On another part of Mindanao, fighting between government troops and pro-Islamic State militants for control of Marawi City has entered its fifth week.Pigcawayan is 190km south of Marawi City.Abu Misry Mama, a spokesperson for the BIFF, told Reuters that the militants had taken civilians to a place safe from the crossfire, and did not intend to hold them hostage.Asked if they would be freed, Mama said: &quot;Yes. We're not kidnappers.&quot;Padilla said the incident at Pigcawayan was not related to the fighting in Marawi. &quot;This has come from a group that has long committed harassments,&quot; he said.
