JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's Treasury has yet to decide whether it will challenge a recommendation by an anti-graft watchdog to change the Reserve Bank mandate, a proposal that rocked markets, the deputy finance minister said on Monday.Asked if Treasury thinks the Public Protector went beyond her mandate with the recommendation, Sfiso Buthelezi said: &quot;We haven't taken a view but as things stand now we are happy that the central bank has exercised its right by taking it for review.&quot;Both the Reserve Bank and Parliament said last week they planned to mount legal challenges to the proposal.&quot;Parliament believes that the remedial action (recommendation), which is binding in terms of the law, usurps the powers of the institution under the Constitution,&quot; it said on its website.Absa has also asked for a court review of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's proposal to change the bank's primary mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to focus instead on growth.Mkhwebane made her proposal at a Pretoria news conference last Monday where she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of Barclays Africa. Eyewitness News reported that Mkhwebane ordered the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to recover more than R1 billion from Absa paid as a bailout in the apartheid era.Advocate Mkhwebane released her findings on the so-called CIEX report.She found that the bank and its predecessor Bankorp unduly benefitted from a R1.125 billion bailout from the Reserve Bank.The bank has denied any wrongdoing. Her call threatens to further stain South Africa's image as an investor-friendly emerging market, coming less than a week after Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane spooked investors by raising the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies to 30% from 26%.The row over the Reserve Bank has also highlighted divisions in the tripartite political alliance of the ruling ANC, the country's biggest union, Cosatu, and the South African Communist Party (SACP).Both the ANC and the SACP are opposed to constitutional changes aimed at altering the role of the Central Bank while Cosatu has backed calls for amendments. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said at a fundraising dinner for the SACP on Friday that suggestions the constitutional mandate of institutions such as the Reserve Bank should be changed must be viewed with concern.&quot;They need to be approached with a comprehensive understanding of the contribution that such institutions make to the stability of our economy, and, hence, the contribution that such institutions make to our ability to fulfill our mandate for fundamental transformation,&quot; he said.Additional reporting by Eyewitness News.
