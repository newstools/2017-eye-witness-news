Trillian CEO Eric Wood has been implicated in the report, mainly for his alleged knowledge about the sacking of the finance minister in 2015 beforehand. JOHANNESBURG Trillian chairperson Tokyo Sexwale says the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Eric Wood, who's been implicated in shocking instances of corruption, shook hands with the wrong people.An independent investigation into Trillian and its links with the Gupta's has shown how the company assisted the family to buy optimum coal mine and how Eskom paid large sums of money for work that it did not have a contract for.Sexwale is is stepping down as Trillian's chair, saying the allegations involving the company are only part of a much bigger picture of state capture.Advocate Geoff Budlender has criticised Trillian management for trying to obstruct his investigation into the company, saying he's been left with the impression that it cannot be trusted.He says despite Trillian stating that it has no links with the Guptas, its majority shareholder Salim Essa, is closely linked to the family and it appears that R160 million was paid from Trillian to Tegeta to help the Gupta's buy the Optimum coal mine.Wood has been implicated in this report, mainly for his alleged knowledge about the president's decision to fire the finance minister in 2015 before the decision was announced.Sexwale says he still believes Wood is a good man. There s a part in your life where you shake hands with the wrong people. At the right time, Mr Wood will stand up and speak for himself. He cannot wait to Clear my name that s what he said. He will be handing over the report to the Public Protector.
