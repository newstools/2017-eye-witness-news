JOHANNESBURG The Black Business Council says it has high expectations for the African National Congress (ANC) s national policy conference which starts on Friday, saying that they expect radical economic transformation to take centre stage.The gathering will review the party s old and new policies and make resolutions that can be effected at the national conference later this year.The radical economic transformation has been the buzz word for the ANC recently, with some leaders in the party embracing the term while others claim it s being used by a faction that wants radical policies to benefit their families and friends.But the Black Business Council supports radical economic transformation.The Council s president Danisa Baloyi says they will push for radical economic transformation to be taken seriously. We re pushing for that because we believe it will help growth in this country. There s no point in us complaining that there s no growth when we still leave the majority of our people outside the economic sphere. By ensuring that we bring more people inside, would ensure growth and we believe that s the only way we can have what others call inclusive growth. She says that as a business, they will make contributions in commissions to ensure that the voice of business is not lost.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
