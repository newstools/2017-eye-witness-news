Treasury says other prominent South Africans including business people and sports people have also been granted naturalisation under these regulations. JOHANNESBURG - The Finance Ministry says Minister Malusi Gigaba has confirmed that letters published on Monday by Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema showing he waived some of the requirements for the Guptas to get citizenship are genuine but says he broke no laws and followed all of the proper processes.Malema published two letters showing that the Guptas were first denied early naturalisation and then showing that Malusi Gigaba had decided to waive some of the requirements when he was Home Affairs minister.Treasury says other prominent South Africans including business people and sports people have also been granted naturalisation under these regulations.Treasury s Mayihlome Tshwete says the minister only followed the advice of his officials when he was at Home Affairs. He always takes the expertise and the advice of the department. This is why the minister has asked the department to explain to the public the legality, the processes and the policies of Home Affairs. Tshwete says he knows this is a difficult situation. The momentum against the Guptas is so guarded that if you were to park next to their car you could have a bad reputation for that. But in this case, there was no flouting of laws. He says Gigaba has now asked the Home Affairs director general to make public all of the documentation relating to their request - to show that he complied with the law.The ministry also says that the sensational reports on this issue have been unfair and that it's not true that Gigaba opened the gates for the Gupta family.It has also reiterated its call for a fully independent investigation into all of the claims around the Gupta family.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
