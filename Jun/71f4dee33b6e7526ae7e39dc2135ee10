The party says it has noted with grave concern reports of allegations contained in a series of emails leaked to the media. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) is calling on the government to urgently seek to establish the veracity of the claims made in the leaked Gupta emails and explanations from those implicated - as a matter of urgency.In a statement issued on Friday the party says it has noted with grave concern reports of allegations contained in a series of emails leaked to the media dubbed #GuptaEmails.&quot;These reports contain very worrying claims about the nature of the relationship between government and private interests.&quot;The ANC views these allegations in a very serious light as if left unattended, they call into question the integrity and credibility of the government and the use of state resources under the direction of or to the benefit of private interests.&quot;Such matters cannot be allowed to fester in the public domain. Accordingly, the ANC calls on government to urgently seek to establish the veracity of these claims and explanation from those implicated.&quot;The ANC further reiterates the resolution of the National Executive Committee, calling for the establishment of a Judicial Commission of Enquiry into allegations of state capture without delay.&quot;The party warns if the allegations are not attended to the integrity and credibility of government could be called into question, along with the use of state resources. The tranche of documents, made public this week, show improper dealings in lucrative government contracts by the controversial Gupta family.The latest allegations could deepen divisions in the ANC as factions battle for control ahead of a party conference in December where Zuma's successor will be chosen.The statement appears to contradict Zuma, who said at a parliamentary session on Thursday that he's not interested in &quot;hearsay&quot; published in newspapers.Zuma has survived calls to resign from within the ANC in recent weeks due to disputes over political appointments and his friendship with the Gupta family.
