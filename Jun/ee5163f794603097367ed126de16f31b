The DA has accused Zwane of failing to declare his trip to India in October 2012. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has accused Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane of breaching the Executive Member s Ethics Act by failing to declare his trip to India in October 2012.It s alleged in leaked Gupta e-mails that the family paid for the trip as a reward after Zwane successfully pushed the Free State provincial government to give Gupta-affiliated company Estina a 4,400-hectare farm and R114 million in funding a few months prior.The opposition party says it's scrutinised the declarations of members' interests from the Free State legislature where Zwane was an MEC and no mention of the trip was made.DA Shadow Minister of Mineral Resources James Lorimer said, Minister Zwane is still liable even though his job description has changed. There is a belief that that trip he took was sponsored by the Guptas as a gift.
