On Saturday Maimane announced Zille's suspension following an outcry over her remarks about what she said were the positives aspects of colonialism. JOHANNESBURG - Former Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Tony Leon has praised Mmusi Maimane for taking tough action against Helen Zille over her colonialism tweets.On Saturday Maimane announced the party's federal executive had resolved to suspend the former DA leader following an outcry over her remarks about what she said were the positives aspects of colonialism.But Zille hit back, saying the DA s constitution requires her to make representation as to why she should not be suspended before she is suspended.The party then issued a statement confirming Zille has been given until Tuesday to give her reasons.Leon, who has called on Zille to step down, says as tough as it was, Maimane had to take action. And I think he had to take some form of legal action rather than waiting for an endless legal process to unfold. And I think he did well. Whether he did correctly legally or not is another matter. But I think he needed to take action to send a signal that this matter couldn t continue at the moment. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
