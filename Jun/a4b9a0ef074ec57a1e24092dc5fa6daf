John McEnroe said that Serena Williams was &#8220;the best female player ever&#8221; but said her performance on the men&#8217;s circuit would be an &#8220;entirely different story.&#8221; NEW YORK An unapologetic John McEnroe has proposed competition between men and women players to prove his claim that 23-time grand slam singles winner Serena Williams would be ranked like 700 in the world if she competed on the men s circuit.Three-time Wimbledon champion McEnroe said Williams was the best female player ever but said her performance on the men s circuit would be an entirely different story. Williams responded on Twitter asking the 58-year-old to leave her out of his statements and called for respect and privacy as she takes time off to have her first child. I felt the need, however, unfortunately, to defend myself and say what I really felt, which is what I think she would be (in the men s rankings), McEnroe told American TV show CBS s This Morning on Tuesday. I ve got a solution. Solve the problem, and I m sure the men would be all for this, the men and women play together. And then we don t have to guess. Former world number one Williams confirmed her pregnancy in April and expects to be back on the court as early as January 2018.
