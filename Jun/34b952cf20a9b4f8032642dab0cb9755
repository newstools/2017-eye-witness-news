WATCH: #SecretBallot Holomisa: We feel vindicatedBALL IN MBETE'S COURTMbete will now have to decide whether to hold a motion of no confidence in the President Zuma in secret.The argument by Mbete that she doesn't have the discretion or is under no obligation to allow for a secret ballot has been dealt a blow.Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said: &quot;The Speaker says that neither the Constitution nor the rules of the National Assembly allow her to authorise a vote by secret ballot. To this extent, she was mistaken. Our interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the rules make it clear, that the Speaker does have the power to authorise a vote by a secret ballot in a motion of no confidence in the president in appropriate circumstances was invalid and must be set aside.&quot;Mogoeng also made it clear the court can't decide for Mbete what decision to take, whatever it is must be rational and Mbete must take it in the spirit of ensuring accountability of the executive. It is her judgment call to make, having due regard to what would be the best procedure to ensure that members exercise their oversight powers most effectively. The Chief Justice said Speaker Mbete must use the existing parliamentary rules to decide on whether to have a motion of no confidence against the president in secret or not.Read the full judgment below: ConCourt on UDM Secret Vote by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd
