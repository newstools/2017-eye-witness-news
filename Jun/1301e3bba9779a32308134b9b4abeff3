The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) reopened the case into Timol's death and High Court in Johannesburg the started with the hearing on Monday. JOHANNESBURG - The nephew of late anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol says the inquest into his uncle's death has started on the right track.The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) reopened the case into Timol's death and the High Court in Johannesburg started with the hearing on Monday.Timol died in police detention 45 years ago after allegedly falling from a window on the tenth floor at the John Vorster Square Police Station, now known as the Johannesburg Central Police Station.Timol's nephew Imtiaz Cajee says: We were never afforded an opportunity for a fair hearing in 1972 during apartheid. Timol's death was ruled a suicide in 1972, however, a private investigation launched by his family uncovered new evidence which it presented to the NPA, asking for the inquest to be reopened.The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has welcomed the NPA s decision to reopen the inquest.The foundation s Neeshan Balton says the court process could help to uncover the truth. But just as importantly, we think that this inquest might complete the work that was started at the TRC. He says that the case might give answers to other families who lost their loved ones in a similar manner. And has possibilities, not only for the team or family, but for many other families who have endured the long pain of not knowing how their loved ones had died, and perhaps would now be able to go a similar route in the near future. Timol was a 30-year-old teacher at the time of his death.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
