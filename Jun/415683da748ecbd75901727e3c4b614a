ANC MP Mondli Gungubele says he is happy that the Constitutional Court has cornered Mbete to now make a rational decision on the secret ballot vote. JOHANNESBURG African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) and former Ekurhuleni Mayor Mondli Gungubele has called on his fellow MPs to express their honest view about President Jacob Zuma when the National Assembly votes on a motion of no confidence in him.Gungubele spoke to Eyewitness News following last week s Constitutional Court ruling that Speaker Baleka Mbete was mistaken to think she doesn't have the power to allow a secret ballot in a motion of no confidence.Opposition parties described the ruling as a victory for ANC MPs who were threatened with disciplinary action should they vote in support of the motion. A secret ballot creates conditions for the freest and honest expression of your view. Gungubele says he is happy that the Constitutional Court has cornered Mbete to now make a rational decision. I m extremely happy that the issue of conscience was articulated by the judge very clearly. He says he doesn't understand the ANC s reasoning that MPs must toe the party line. Why would any revolutionary movement force its members to choose because of the nation and the party? He has this message for ANC MPs who chose to be silent about the need for a secret ballot. Their silence would define what they stand for during this period because this period calls you to stand for something. He says it's in the interest of democracy that conditions to express honest and free views are created.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
