JOHANNESBURG - The uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) has rejected allegations that the accreditation of its delegates at the elective conference was flawed and that its president Kebby Maphatsoe strong-armed the Defence Department director-general to release R8 million for the conference.The African National Congress (ANC) s structure held a briefing earlier on Monday following its elective conference last week.Maphatsoe has denied the report in the Sunday Times, that he pressured director-general Max Ozynski into paying out almost R8 million to fund the four-day MKMVA conference. I was never involved. How it happened was that the minister authorised. He's also denied that a verification process conducted by the department revealed that 637 delegates could not be traced in the department s database and were not bona fide military veterans. We reject with contempt the unsubstantiated allegations that the selection and accreditation of the delegates were flawed or fraudulent.
