Last year, Combs came in 22nd on the list. LOS ANGELES - Rapper and music producer Sean "Diddy" Combs  was named the world's highest-paid entertainer on Monday, ousting pop singer Taylor Swift who fell to 49th place on the Forbes annual list. Beyonce moved into the second spot with $105 million, courtesy of her best-selling Lemonade album and world tour, while British author JK Rowling ($95 million) moved back into the top three thanks largely to her Harry Potter spinoff movie franchise Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Combs, 47, earned an estimated $130 million in the 12 months ended 1 June 2017, Forbes said. It attributed the big payout to his Bad Boy Family Reunion Tour, earnings from his Sean John clothing line, and his partnership with Ciroc vodka.
