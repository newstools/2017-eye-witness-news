I haven t overstepped and I think those will be the deliberations which we ll be having further and again, I ll see how the notice of motion, the content and why are they disputing that. we ll take it from there. Mkhwebane has welcomed the legal action by those opposed to the report, saying it is within their rights to do so. WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS Mkhwebane believes those opposing her findings on the Bankorp bailout are within their rights to challenge it.While visiting Masiphumelele on Friday, Mkhwebane said she welcomes the legal action planned by Absa and Parliament over her report. That is welcomed, I mean it is within their right to do that. And I think we will find an opportunity to engage more, ventilate on the issues we need to discuss. Mkhwebane said there also needs to be a re-look at whether the laws in the country are benefitting South Africans, especially at a grassroots level. When I compile reports, I need to check what prejudice did the person who has been affected by that conduct is facing. So now the prejudice is South Africans should have benefitted from that money but on top of that, is the current status quo benefitting South Africans - which I don t think it's benefitting South Africans.
