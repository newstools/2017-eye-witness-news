JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) has condemned the Black First Land First s (BLF) threats and intimidation of journalist and editor Peter Bruce.A group of people wearing BLF T-shirts descended on Bruce's private residence picketing against so-called white monopoly capital.The group descended on Bruce s private residence in Johannesburg on Thursday picketing against so-called white monopoly capital.Bruce has often criticised the Guptas and penned a comment this morning in which he blamed the controversial family for being responsible for surveillance of his movements last year.The handful or rowdy and aggressive BLF members held up placards questioning why Peter Bruce hasn t written anything about so-called white monopoly capital.When Business Day Editor Tim Cohen arrived to support Bruce and tried to take a picture of the group he was assaulted before the police intervened.On social media one of the BLF members who is also an accused in a criminal matter posted a picture of Bruce with the slogan one bullet, one settler.Sanef says it strongly condemns the invasion of Bruce s personal life as part of a cowardly act to silence him.It says the group s conduct is unacceptable and has urged Bruce to report the perpetrators to the police.Bruce says the rowdy picket outside his home marks a sad day for media freedom.He says the group picketed for about four hours outside his home. It s a sad day I think for media freedom in South Africa where you get a 'rent a crowd' right outside of your house. It wasn't a big crowd, it was 35 at the most. But when they re gathered outside of your house it's quite large. They stayed there for about four hours until the police managed to convince them to bugger off. They also wrote &quot;land or death on his garage door.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
