HARARE - It's emerged that more elephants have been poisoned in Zimbabwe's main Hwange National Park.Poachers are reported to have left cyanide along elephant trails in the south of the park to kill the animals.Local conservation group The Bhejane Trust says at least 10 elephants have been killed along the park s periphery in recent days, along with an unknown number of vultures.That's six more than national parks spokesman Simukai Nyasha confirmed.The four that he mentioned appeared to have been killed within the park, rather than outside it.The parks spokesman has told the state-run Chronicle that five sites outside the park boundary had also been contaminated with cyanide.Cyanide was first used by poachers in Hwange in 2013; the fear is that as the dry season rolls on there could be more of this type of poaching.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
