JOHANNESBURG - Trade union union National Health Education &amp; Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) has suspended a strike by forensic pathology officers at five Western Cape mortuaries.The three-day strike led to a backlog at the Salt River and Tygerberg forensic pathology laboratories where 123 families were affected.The union complained that pathology officers, who are assistants to pathologists, were required to dissect bodies, a function apparently not stipulated in their contracts.Nehawu provincial secretary Eric Kweleta says workers have been instructed to go back to work after striking a deal with the department. Our people can continue to work there while their inexperience subjects them being supervised by professionals. Furthermore, they must be compensated because they are doing something that is out of their scope. The Health Department's Mark van der Heever has thanked those officers who were not part of the strike. Because they have gone the extra mile in ensuring that over the last 24 hours the department has been able to process 30 cases, 30 autopsies so that we can at least assist some of our members in getting that closure to be able to bury their relatives.
