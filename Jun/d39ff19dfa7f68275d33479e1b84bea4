JOHANNESBURG - The City of Johannesburg has encouraged customers to continue to pay their bills despite complaints lodged with the city. The municipality went on a door-to-door campaign targeting households and businesses who have not settled their bills despite several notices. The city’s Kgamanyane Maphologela says: “While querying, you still continue to consume. And if you continue to consume the city cannot just live in a situation of indebtedness… without applying the city’s Credit Control and Debt Collection Policy.” In June, the City of Johannesburg said that a major part of its billing system had failed and that 420,000 account holders will not receive their bills this month. The city also said nearly a further 100,000 account statements had been issued incorrectly. Officials said the system that had failed in this way is an automated system, leading to suspicions about why this has happened. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
