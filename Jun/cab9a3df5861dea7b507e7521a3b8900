Like Nelson Mandela, like Walter Sisulu respected our Constitution of the country and who understand exactly where we come from in our history with Freedom Charter and many other documents which are important for the ANC, which encapsulate our values, who understand that this country is governed by the rule of law and respect every citizen s right. Meanwhile, Phosa has accepted nominations to run for the position of ANC leader.Phosa said the people are calling for change. It s really humbling because it is people who are in love with the ANC, who cry for an alternative leadership and who believe the ANC deserve an alternative leadership both at political and economic levels. These are ordinary people and I m happy that it is them who make the choice about who must or mustn t be their leader. Most of the councillors called for a leader to unite the party and they believe Phosa is the man to mend the ANC's problems.Zuma will vacate his position following the party's elective conference in December.Nkosazana-Dlamini Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa are believed to be strong contenders for the top position.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
