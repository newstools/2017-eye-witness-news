JOHANNESBURG - Activist shareholder Allan Gray said on Tuesday it had lost faith in South African construction company Group Five's board to act in the best interest of the firm following the resignation of several directors and its chief executive.More than 10 executive and non-executive directors at Group Five have resigned since February, including non-executive director Babalwa Ngonyama, chairperson of the firm's audit committee and Mark Thomson, remuneration committee chairperson. No reasons were given for the resignations.Chief Executive Eric Vemer resigned in February after the company reported its first six-month loss in 11 years due to a R255 million settlement with SA's government.&quot;They have been unable to regain our trust following numerous meetings and engagements,&quot; Allan Gray Chief Investment Officer Andrew Lapping told Reuters, adding the board's response after the resignations had been &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;.In May the fund manager, which owns 25% of the company, notified Group Five of its request to call an extraordinary general meeting to reconstitute the board following a disagreement with it on the future direction of the company.Five non-executive directors resigned on Friday ahead of the meeting.Allan Gray has proposed that Michael Upton, former group chief executive at Group Five, be appointed to the new board along with other four nominated members.
