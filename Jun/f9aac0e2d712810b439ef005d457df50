If elected, Thabane says he&#8217;ll disband the army because the mountain kingdom has no prospect of invading anyone. PRETORIA- Former Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Thabane appears to have taken a narrow lead after early tallying of votes cast in Sunday's election.Thabane fled the country after an attempted coup in 2014 and lost an election to Pakalitha Mosisili who is his chief rival in this context.Thabane sheltered in South Africa for 18 months before returning to contest Lesotho s third election in five years.If elected he says he ll disband the army because the Mountain Kingdom has no prospect of invading anyone.Military interference plays a major part in the instability that wrecks the country with unacceptably high levels of HIV/AIDS, poverty and unemployment.The heavy presence of troops that confused some voters and intimidated many on Sunday is being probed by Lesotho s electoral commission.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
