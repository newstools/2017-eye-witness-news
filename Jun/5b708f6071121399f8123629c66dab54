President Jacob Zuma addresses Members of Parliament in the House as he answers the Presidency budget questions. CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma says so-called &quot;radical economic transformation&quot; is government policy and should have been implemented three years ago. Zuma is addressing Members of Parliament in the House as he answers the Presidency budget questions. Zuma is delivering his reply to Wednesday s debate on his Presidency budget but opposition benches are largely empty.The Democratic Alliance (DA), the Economic Freedom Fighters, the United Democratic Movement and the Congress of the People are not present.Last year eight opposition parties boycotted Zuma s reply to his Presidency budget vote debate, leaving him to address mainly African National Congress (ANC) MPs.This year is a replay of those events.Smaller parties like the Freedom Front Plus and the Inkhatha Freedom Party (IFP) are in the chamber, however.Zuma has told IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi that radical economic transformation was decided on at the ANC's conference in Mangaung in 2012 and is very much the government's policy. So people who are still doubting about this, they can read the resolutions. They can't seek for more clarity, the resolutions are clear. And our duty as the government of the ANC is to implement that. In fact, we are late in implementing that. We ought to have implemented it in 2013, immediately. The bigger opposition parties are expected to return to the house once Zuma has finished for Thursday afternoon s snap debate on the scourge of violence against women and children, which was requested by the DA.During the budget debate on Wednesday afternoon, opposition parties accused Zuma of putting himself first and handing over state institutions to the controversial Gupta family.Zuma will not only have to defend the budget of the Presidency, but also his right to keep his job amid calls from opposition parties that he resign.
