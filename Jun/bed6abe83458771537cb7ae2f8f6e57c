The party says all allegations related to state capture will be scrutinised during a judicial commission appointed to investigate the information. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says all allegations related to state capture will be scrutinised during a judicial commission appointed to investigate the information that has emerged in recent weeks.The extent of the Gupta family's dealings with state-owned enterprises have been laid bare, with fresh email leaks revealing how the family has been pocketing billions of rand through dubious transactions, including Malusi Gigaba's apparent hand in fast tracking documents and a former Eskom chief executive' s questionable conduct. In a joint amaBhungane and Daily Maverick expose, more leaked emails show how the Guptas have been diverting billions from Transnet s purchase of locomotives to their offshore accounts.The president's son Duduzane Zuma has once again emerged as one of the central figures in a web of alleged corruption involving the Gupta family.Files suggest that the Guptas took care of his every need, from paying for a Mauritian getaway for him and his then girlfriend in 2012, to funding his lavish multi-million rand marriage to Shanice Stork in April 2015, to setting him up with an R18-million Dubai apartment in the world s tallest skyscraper, the iconic Burj Khalifa.The Gupta circle was also privy to some of his most sensitive secrets, with Gupta associate Ashu Chawla seemingly enjoying access to Duduzane s private Gmail account, which shows the same ex-girlfriend sending him suggestive pictures just a day after his new wife told him she was pregnant with their first child.The ANC s Zizi Kodwa says a commission will deal with the claims. There have been more allegations coming up. The former Public Protector released her report some time ago. We have decided to establish a platform, through a judicial commission of inquiry, where everyone can provide information on the claims.
