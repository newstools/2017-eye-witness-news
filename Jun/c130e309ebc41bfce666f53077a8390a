Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown had requested the Eskom board to reverse his reappointment after he resigned from the parastatal. JOHANNESBURG The Eskom board and the Public Enterprises Ministry have confirmed receiving legal communication informing them of former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe s decision to fight his dismissal at the Labour Court on Monday.Molefe s return to Eskom was cut short on Friday, with Eskom announcing the decision to rescind his reappointment.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown had requested the Eskom board to reverse his reappointment after he resigned from the parastatal.Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela had implicated him in the State of Capture report.Molefe s journey with Eskom has been a dramatic one over the past year, from an emotional exit to a disputed appointment as an African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament to a jubilant return as Eskom CEO and then his exit.Eskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma says the parastatal's legal team is preparing their response. Our lawyers are putting together papers so that we can derive our response and be able to fall in line with the permutations of the court in terms of timelines and so on. When asked whether Eskom had considered the legal consequences of the dismissal, Qoma told Eyewitness News that the board was merely complying with the instructions from the minister.Minister Brown s spokesperson Colin Cruywagen said he could only confirm having received the court papers.GIGABA ON MOLEFE S REHIRINGLast week, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said a decision by Eskom s board to reinstate Molefe as chief executive officer has caused government and the parastatal a lot of harm and reputational damage.The decision he said, should never have been taken.Gigaba was part of an inter-ministerial committee that instructed Brown to order the Eskom board to rescind its decision to re-employ Molefe. The events of the few weeks have been quite painful in a number of ways. The view of the IMC is that this decision should not have been taken. Gigaba said that by rescinding the decision to re-employ Brian Molefe as head of Eskom, he hopes it will redeem not only the power utility but also the image of government. We should not only act correctly just to please the ratings agencies, we should act correctly precisely because these are public entities and the resources that they hold, they hold on behalf of the people of South Africa. Gigaba said he didn t believe there s something inherently inefficient about state-owned companies, and that they can be run well by capable individuals.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
