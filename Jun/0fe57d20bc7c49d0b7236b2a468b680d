LONDON Arsenal s Olivier Giroud has said he is unhappy with the lack of playing time he got last season, according to The Times, and with the Premier League club linked to a host of strikers across Europe the Frenchman may find himself even further down the pecking order.Giroud, who was largely used as a substitute last season, netting 12 goals but starting just 11 league games, said he planned to discuss his future with coach Arsene Wenger. I ll talk to the coach, Giroud said. I had limited playing time but, at some point, there are things I will not be satisfied with another year with such low playing time. It will be necessary to think with my family and advisers. I still have three years with Arsenal, so my future is for now with Arsenal. I feel good, I want to win the championship of England. Afterwards, I do not know what my near future will be. Media reports previously linked Giroud, who signed a long-term contract extension at Arsenal in January, with French side Marseille.
