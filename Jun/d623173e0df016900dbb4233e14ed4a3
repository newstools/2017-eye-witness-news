The 20-year-old was arrested in connection with the murder of 18-year-old Lekita Moore in Valhalla Park in September. CAPE TOWN - Closing argument in the trial against multiple murder accused Cameron Wilson has been postponed until later this week. The 20-year-old was arrested in connection with the murder of 18-year-old Lekita Moore in Valhalla Park in September. At the time, Wilson was out on bail in connection with the murder of Stacey Lee Mohale in Heinz Park in April 2015. The defence has requested a postponement due to personal reasons.The State has not objected and the matter has been postponed until Thursday.Judge Chantel Fortuin says the court was initially unwilling to grant the postponement, but it has conceded because it is in the interest of justice to afford the defence an opportunity to prepare adequately. Wilson is accused of stabbing Moore 98 times, but he's blamed someone else and has denied any involvement in the other charges against him, which are four murders, four attempted murders and three rapes. Earlier this month, Wilson s mother took the stand and insisted her son was at home on the night he allegedly shot dead a Heinz Park man more than two years ago.Bridgette Wilson said she was in the kitchen while her son played video games on the night of Toyher Stober's murder in October 2014.She testified that Wilson ran to the crime scene. She added a relative later informed her he was being accused of the murder.The State, however, pointed out several discrepancies between her testimony and the version the accused told the court.The witness conceded she did not always know her son's whereabouts.The prosecution also accused her of lying about certain details pertaining to other crimes her son is accused of.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
