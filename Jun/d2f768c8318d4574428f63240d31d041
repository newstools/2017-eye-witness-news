The NTL&#8217;s Craig Nte says the NPA and the police have been deliberately delaying the charges against Lucky Montana and would ultimately like to see them thrown out. JOHANNESBURG The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the Hawks have been accused of failing to investigate corruption amounting to R24 billion that allegedly took place at Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa).The National Transport Movement (NTM) and the South African Federation of Trade Unions made the claims in their case against former Prasa CEO Lucky Montana.Montana was fired from the parastatal after the Public Protector found that he irregularly awarded tenders, appointed companies and suspended employees.The NTM then lodged a complaint with the Public Protector's office and the police but they claim their case has been overlooked.The NTM s Craig Nte says the NPA and the police have been deliberately delaying the charges against Lucky Montana and would ultimately like to see them thrown out. Initially it was a general that dealt with the docket. Now we re at the level of a captain. Surely, we can expect that nothing will come out of the investigation. South African Federation of Trade Unions Zwelinzima Vavi says the union has information on why the tenders awarded by Montana have to be nullified, but this also has not been acted on. But this evidence was handed over by me, amongst others, to the office of the Public Protector. The NPA will not act because the NPA itself has been domesticated, the teeth have been taken out. It is left with nothing except soft gums. The NTM have dismissed the preliminary report being prepared by the Public Protector, saying she is also captured by the ruling party.ZUMA S INTERFERENCEThe NTM and the Saftu have accused President Jacob Zuma and Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi of trying to disrupt investigations into parastatals by threatening to dissolve the Prasa board.Earlier this month the Transport Minister sent a letter to board chair Popo Molefe, threatening to dissolve the board after it failed to perform and turn the company around.The NTM s general-secretary Elijah Mphahlele said the apparent eagerness to dissolve the Prasa board just five weeks before its tenure is over is a clear attempt to cover up corruption.He said the NTM and Saftu are demanding that the board complete its work and that neither the Hawks nor the National Prosecuting Authority should interfere in the process.They have threatened to embark on sustained mass action until justice is served.The NTM and Saftu have also called for the immediate resignation of Maswanganyi and Zuma and for members of civil society to sit on the new boards of all parastatals.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
