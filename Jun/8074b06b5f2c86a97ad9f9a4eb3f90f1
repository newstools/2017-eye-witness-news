The Zimbabwean leader is due to address his second youth rally in the eastern city of Mutare on Friday. ZIMBABWE - If you want to get your roads tarred, just make sure President Robert Mugabe is coming to a rally near you.The Zimbabwean leader is due to address his second youth rally in the eastern city of Mutare on Friday and the rate of road repairs has been astonishing.The road out of Mutare to nearly as far as the Dangamvura township has been re-tarred and that is something residents will be very grateful for.From early this morning, buses of supporters were seen coming into the eastern border city, which has long had a fair amount of sympathy for the opposition.On Thursday supporters staged what was billed as a carnival along the main shopping street with children, drums and a police escort.The president's visits to Mutare are not frequent and there's likely to be much interest in his appearance at the Sakubva Stadium on Friday afternoon.Formal unemployment is high in the city although there is a bustling trade in vending, especially of clothes and goods brought in from Mozambique.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
