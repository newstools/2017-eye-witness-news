The party has responded to reports that the Gupta family spied on Julius Malema, with claims the controversial family wants the EFF leader dead. JOHANNESBURG The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has responded to reports that the Gupta family spied on Julius Malema with claims the controversial family wants Malema dead.The red berets have confirmed reports of alleged spying published in the Sunday papers.They allege the Guptas obtained information on Malema from the Home Affairs and State Security Departments.The EFF says it s very concerned about the safety of its leader but has given the Guptas a strong warning that if the state security department does not take decisive action, the party will take the action to their doorstep.The EFF s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the party has the right to use all the revolutionary means it has to defend themselves. To have leverage over the life of our leader just waiting for authorities who are drunk with being captured and they are not protecting Members of Parliament and political leaders. Ndlozi says the Guptas have undermined the generosity of South Africa which welcomed them as foreigners. It has been exhausted. This family must go back to wherever they came from. Ndlozi says it s clear this information was obtained from Home Affairs during the time Malusi Gigaba was the minister. The time when Malusi Gigaba, who is their number one stooge, was the Home Affairs minister we have no doubt that he had a hand in that or his department for that matter. We know for sure that the persons that are spying on the CIC (Malema) is the government itself. At the same time, the Sunday Times reported it has information that the family is in possession of a spreadsheet with sensitive information, including travel details of banking bosses and other politicians, dating back to 2015.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
