We must talk to each other, we must reach out to each other, we must always avoid getting into shootouts even when we disagree, we must also engage in discussions. And he says, in the end, this conference could really boil down to the economic transformation sub-commission. Economics are the essence of politics and therefore we will apply our minds on those issues and talk about practical steps that must be taken, and allow that commission I know, normally it becomes the biggest commission.
