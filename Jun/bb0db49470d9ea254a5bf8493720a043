This decision is a tough one for us, as you can appreciate as it is for the employee, but nevertheless, it s something that needs to happen to preserve the viability of the remaining mines which employ two-thirds of the workforce. At the same time, labour unions say they are concerned about potential job cuts across the mining sector after AngloGold Ashanti's announcement.Unions have called on the mining company to rethink its position.The National Union of Mineworkers Livhuwani Mammburu says they are angry and shocked after being notified of the possible retrenchments of 8,500 workers at AngloGold Ashanti.
