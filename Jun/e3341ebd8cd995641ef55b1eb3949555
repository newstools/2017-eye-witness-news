JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says he's open to talks with companies over the new Mining Charter.However, he's also rebuked the mining firms for planning to take the new rules to court, saying they're negotiating in bad faith .The minister unveiled the charter last week, raising the threshold for black ownership in the mining industry to 30% and bringing in other regulations the sector says it cannot afford.The Chamber of Mines claims it was not properly consulted and says it'll challenge the charter in court.Last week, the Democratic Alliance said the release of the Mining Charter is proof that the African National Congress (ANC) government doesn t care about long-term and sustainable transformation in the mining sector.The party said Zwane opened the doors to more ANC crony enrichment and that the charter will be a disaster for the mining industry.Zwane said the charter is an instrument for radical economic change in the mining sector and will increase black participation.The opposition party said one way of diversifying the mining sector would be to bring mine workers into mining schemes.
