GNThe court says it cannot determine whether Dlamini should be held personally liable for costs incurred in the South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) payment debacle without proper investigation.In March, the court ruled that service provider Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) must continue paying social grants for the next 12 months as Sassa had not come up with an alternative payment solution.Justice Johan Froneman says the Constructional Court cannot make an order adverse to Dlamini on the basis of allegations that are untested.However, Froneman says the question about whether the minister acted in bad faith when called upon to explain her conduct in the Sassa payment issue cannot be ignored. The parties must report to this court whether they ve agreed to process in terms of Section 38 of the Superior Court Act 10 of 2013, in order to determine the issues related to the minister s role and responsibility in the establishment and functioning of the workstreams referred to in the affidavits filed by Mr Thokozani Magwaza and Mr Zane Dangor.
