Only 49 municipalities achieved clean audits, while irregular expenditure increased by more than 50% to R 16.8 billion. CAPE TOWN - Parliamentarians have been briefed on the audit results of the country's 263 municipalities on Wednesday.The Auditor General's report, released last week, showed minimal improvement in the overall performance of local government during the past financial year.Only 49 municipalities achieved clean audits, while irregular expenditure increased by more than 50% to R 16.8 billion.Recurring problems identified by the Auditor General include poor financial planning, lack of accountability and the sluggish response of managers and political leaders to serious issues within municipalities.Chairperson of the Cooperative Governance Oversight Committee, Richard Mdakane, says underperforming municipalities could be called to account to Parliament. We will identify municipalities that need intervention. But we are not really talking about intervention in terms of taking over the administration, but assisting them to perform better the next financial year. The Free State, North West and the Northern Cape delivered the poorest audit results.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
