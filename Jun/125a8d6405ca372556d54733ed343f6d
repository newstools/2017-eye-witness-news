If as members of the alliance, we see that one component of the alliance is making a mistake and we leave them to continue with the mistake, that is an unrevolutionary act, that s actually a betrayal of the objectives of our revolution. #Nehawu Ramaphosa has been given this blanket as a gift. They call him incoming Pres. CM pic.twitter.com/NxjfPysJiKEarlier, Nehawu president Mzwandile Makwayiba warned that constitutional democracy is problematic and that it is simply not working for the country. Because comrades, when 62% majority in Parliament decide, when few individuals are not happy, they go to court and six men and women they decide on behalf of the 62%. That s my problem. Makwayiba also called on the African National Congress to stop imposing leaders on the people if it wants to win back lower metros. That we be able to take the mass part of Johannesburg under Mashaba, that we must take the mass part of Tshwane away from DA. But we must tell the African National Congress: Stop imposing candidates to the people.
