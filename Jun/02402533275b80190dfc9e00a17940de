Government said on Wednesday Mosebenzi Zwane would make the announcement today but the chamber says there has not been a proper process. JOHANNESBURG As Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane is expected to announce the new Mining Charter on Thursday morning, the Chamber of Mines says it will not be co-opted into a flawed process by the ministry.While the government says that Zwane will announce the new Mining Charter this morning, the Chamber of Mines says there has been no proper process of consultation.They also say they were only invited on Wednesday to a meeting with Zwane today which is scheduled for only an hour before Zwane s planned announcement.The Chamber says the exact purpose of using that mechanism in this way is highly suspicious.The Gupta emails indicate that Zwane helped the Guptas take R84 million from the Free State government in 2014.Last year, he also lied while claiming that Cabinet was going to recommend an inquiry into the banking sector.
