I am not sure if it s stored or used for something, but an investigation will follow. It s about 5,000 square meters of area where tyres have been dumped or stored. Pieterse says the fire is likely to last throughout the night due to the shortage of water. The problem we are facing is that there is no water at the site so we are using water tankers. We are running up and down to refill the tankers at nearby hydrants.
