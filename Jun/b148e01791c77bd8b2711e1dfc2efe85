Two men, who were accused of killing Iyapha Yamile, had rape and murder charges against them withdrawn in the Khayelistha Magistrates Court on Friday. CAPE TOWN - Some Khayelitsha residents believe police in the area have failed the community after two men, who were accused of killing four-year-old Iyapha Yamile, were released. The pair had rape and murder charges against them withdrawn in the Khayelistha Magistrates Court on Friday because evidence could not conclusively link the men to the little girl s killing.Iyapha s body was found stuffed in a plastic bag in the Town Two informal settlement last month. Friday s verdict angered residents who on Saturday led by the Social Justice Coalition (SJC) marched to the Lingelethu West police station. #IyaphaYamile The decision has angered residents who today, led by the SJC, marched to the Lingelethu West police station.

The two charges of rape and murder against the suspects were struck off the role due to the absent of DNA evidence. And our question is; how about the murder charge because there s circumstantial evidence pointing towards the two accused. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
