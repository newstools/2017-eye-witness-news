Molefe's return to Eskom was cut short on Friday with Eskom announcing the decision to rescind his reappointment. JOHANNESBURG - Corruption Watch says Brian Molefe's Labour Court application against Eskom and the Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown will be unsuccessful. Molefe's return to Eskom was cut short on Friday with Eskom announcing the decision to rescind his reappointment.Minister Brown had requested the Eskom board to reverse his reappointment after he resigned from the parastatal.Corruption Watch's David Lewis says Molefe s move comes as a surprise. I can t believe that he still believes he can head Eskom under any circumstances happening again. If it does, boy, you ll know we ve been badly beaten. Last week, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said that a decision by Eskom s board to reinstate Molefe as chief executive officer had caused government and the parastatal a lot of harm and reputational damage.He said the decision should never have been taken.WATCH: Pickets &amp; Praises: Eskom boss returns to workGigaba was part of an inter-ministerial committee that instructed Brown to order the Eskom board to rescind its decision to re-employ Molefe.Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela had implicated him in the State of Capture report.Last month it emerged how Molefe helped the Guptas grab a mine.In an amaBhungane exclusive, former Mineral Resources Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi revealed how the Guptas managed to secure the Optimum coal mine from Glencore in 2015 at a time when Molefe was in constant contact with the controversial family.AmaBhungane s Sam Sole said Molefe played an integral part in this &quot;forced sale&quot;. In the meantime, Molefe comes in as the CEO and really is instrumental in putting on the squeeze on Glencore to the extent that they eventually back down and sell the mine to the Guptas. Ramatlhodi said he refused to suspend all of Glencore s South African mining licences as Molefe and Eskom chair Ben Ngubane had insisted.Ramatlhodi said he was fired as Mineral Resources minister shortly after this and replaced by Mosebenzi Zwane, a known Gupta associate.Additional reporting by Gia Nicolaides &amp; Stephen Grootes.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
