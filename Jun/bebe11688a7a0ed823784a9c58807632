JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says he will use his department’s budget of over R40 billion to prioritise township education as well as teacher and early childhood development. Lesufi has delivered his department’s 2017/18 budget speech in the Gauteng Legislature. Education has received the biggest chunk of the Gauteng government’s fiscal year budget with R40.8 billion set aside to improve the schooling system.  Lesufi says the majority of this budget will go towards improving school infrastructure and accelerating quality education at all schools, especially in the townships. “We need to implement without any hesitation the infrastructure norms and standards so that our schools can be schools that all of us can be proud of.” He says his department will also invest in teacher training. “We need to invest in teacher development, especially within the grade R and the foundation phase.”  The education MEC says over the past few years his department has worked to eliminate inappropriate school infrastructure, replacing it with state-of-the-art equipment. HIGH RATE OF TEENAGE PREGNANCY Lesufi says his department is worried about social problems in the schooling environment, with more than 4,000 pupils falling pregnant at schools in the province last year alone. Lesufi says the high rate of teenage pregnancy at Gauteng schools needs urgent intervention. “Over 4,400 learners fell pregnant in 2016 within our schooling environment, including one learner in grade 5.” He says young girls and boys must be taught about the consequences of having unprotected sex. “If we can’t intervene, we’ll indeed surrender these children to poverty.” The education MEC says his department can’t tackle the problem alone and says communities also need to play their part.
