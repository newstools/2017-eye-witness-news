And I'm sure dring the course of this PGC we ll get the opportunity to lobby ANC structures to agree that in the national conference, among other leaders that we ll elect those leaders must be led by comrade Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. This was followed by loud cheering and clapping. #KZNANCPGC Mshengu: And when that time comes we will lobby structures to agree to be led by Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
