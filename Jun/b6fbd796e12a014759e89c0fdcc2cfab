CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape is pushing ahead with its plan to table a motion of no confidence in Premier Helen Zille. It has criticised the way in which the Democratic Alliance (DA) disciplined Zille over the colonialism tweets saga.As part of a political settlement, she will step down from all party structures but will retain her position as premier. Zille has also again apologised for the tweets.WATCH: DA and Zille reach settlement around colonialism tweetThe ANC s Zizi Kodwa has labelled the agreement an unadulterated defence of white supremacy and privilege . If you understand where we come from the impact both in terms of what we re dealing with - inequality and unemployment - a person like her who praises colonialism should ve been removed from all party official activities including Western Cape premier position. Provincial ANC secretary Faiez Jacobs has labelled the agreement as a face-saving strategy.He says they will be demonstrating outside the provincial legislature on Thursday. Does the DA expect South Africans to believe that it has no confidence in Zille to the extent that she s banned from political activities but still has confidence to lead the province? A remark about stepping aside for the country shows that this announcement is about making Mmusi Maimane look as if he s in charge. If he s really in charge he would ve fired her.
