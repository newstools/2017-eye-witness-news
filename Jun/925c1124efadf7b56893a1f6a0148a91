Last week, MKMVA President Kebby Maphatsoe had announced they would support Fikile Mbalula to take over as ANC's 2nd deputy SG. JOHANNESBURG - The uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) has dropped African National Congress (ANC) NEC member Fikile Mbalula from its list of preferred candidates.Last week, MKMVA President Kebby Maphatsoe announced that the structure would support Mbalula to take over as the second deputy secretary general of the party.Mbalula has been openly critical of the MKMVA's preferred candidate for secretary general Free State Premier Ace Magashule, saying he would destroy what's left of the ANC.He has since thrown his support behind Gauteng Premier David Makhura for the position.Last week, on the last day of the MKMVA elective conference, Maphatsoe told the media who his organisation would be supporting at the party's elective conference later this year. Our proposal is to retain Jessie Duarte as a deputy secretary general and have young people, Comrade Fikile Mbalula to be the second deputy secretary general. The name of Mbalula has now been dropped from that list. The secretary general is Ace Magashule and the deputy secretary general is Comrade Jessie Duarte. The treasure general is comrade Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. Maphatsoe claims when he made that statement to journalists, the conference had not resolved on the list yet.He denied that Mbalula's tweets about Magashule had anything to do with his name now not being included in the list of its preferred candidates.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
