Nehawu has accused Gengezi Mgidlana of abusing his position and damaging the decorum of the institution. CAPE TOWN - Parliament has announced that the secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana has been granted special leave effective as of Friday.A statement issued by Parliament says Mgidlana wrote to the presiding officers - Speaker Baleka Mbete and National Council of Provinces chairperson Thandi Modise - requesting to be placed on special leave while allegations levelled against him by the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) are investigated.Parliamentary workers say Mgidlana does not deserve his job and he's damaging the decorum of the institution.They allege he has abused his position by taking unwarranted overseas trips, awarding himself a bursary and an exgratia payment and corrupting Parliament's tender system.Nehawu branch chairperson Sthembiso Tembe said: If they fail to act they mustn t blame the workers of Parliament if they resort to acts that will seek to enforce that particular principle. The union says Mgidlana has suspended a number of people under investigation and there's no reason why he should not be too.The statement from Parliament says the presiding officers recently referred several allegations regarding administrative irregularities against the secretary to Parliament to an independent audit committee of Parliament for investigation. The independent audit committee, comprised of external individuals in line with provisions of the Financial Management of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act, is expected to probe the allegations with the necessary swiftness and to report back to the presiding officers.&quot;The presiding officers wish to state that, consistent with the principles of natural justice, the secretary to Parliament remains innocent until proven otherwise.&quot;In the absence of Mgidlana, the presiding officers will appoint one of the two deputy secretaries to Parliament as acting secretary to Parliament.It's been almost a year since Nehawu asked the Public Protector to probe the matter.
