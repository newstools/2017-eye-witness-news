We are most certainly worried, this is the first time that Zimbabwe has had a highly pathogenic avian influenza in its chickens. It had in ostriches once before as has South Africa. But we ve never had it in South Africa in chicken either and that means we are still at risk. Lovell says they are working with government as well. Government has had a contingency plan in the event of an avian influenza outbreak since the mid-2000s. He says that research is currently being conducted to determine whether the virus is being spread by wild birds moving over borders or by human activity.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
