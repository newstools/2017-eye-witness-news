Researched by Kate Wilkinson.South African President Jacob Zuma has survived a number of attempts to remove him from office. This fact sheet breaks them down.How many political lives does South Africa s President Jacob Zuma have?With the prospect of another motion of no confidence before the country s Parliament, Africa Check tallied up previous attempts to remove him from office.WHAT IS A MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE?Section 102 of the South African Constitution allows for members of Parliament to remove the president from office if they have lost confidence in him.A majority is needed for the motion to pass, professor of constitutional law at the University of Cape Town Pierre de Vos told Africa Check. The number of votes needed for a vote of no confidence would therefore normally be 201 out of 400. The number remains the same even if, say 200 MPs do not attend the sitting then, clearly, the motion will not pass, explained De Vos.In the event that it passes, the president, his ministers and their deputies must resign.Since Zuma took office, five draft resolutions about motions of no confidence in the president have been brought before the National Assembly. Three motions of no confidence have been voted on, one has been amended and one has been withdrawn, parliamentary spokesman Moloto Mothapo told Africa Check.3 MOTIONS VOTED ON17 March 2015A motion of no confidence in President Zuma was brought by the leader of the Democratic Alliance Mmusi Maimane.Maimane s reasons for calling the motion were that under Zuma s leadership: (a) independent institutions of the state have been politicised and weakened; (b) unemployment has escalated to unprecedented levels; (c) the economy is at its weakest point in recent history; (d) the right of access to quality education has been violated; and (e) corruption has spiralled out of control. The motion was unsuccessful.

He moved that: (1) under [Zuma s] irrational, irresponsible and reckless leadership (a) important institutions of state have been captured by private interest; (b) state resources, notably state security, law enforcement and prosecuting authorities have been mobilised to shield those interests from public scrutiny and investigation; (2) the president has allegedly attempted to evade accountability to the public protector and frustrated her efforts to fulfil her constitutional mandate; and (3) his derelict leadership has resulted in a collapse of public confidence in the president of the Republic of South Africa, a government at war with itself and that this ultimately hasundermined efforts to restore confidence in the South African economy. The motion was unsuccessful.

As a result, the amendment was passed.With regards to the new motion that the house has full confidence in the president 242 members of Parliament voted in favour, 83 voted against and 6 abstained.

Addressing the house, he stated that during the tenure of President Jacob Zuma as president of the Republic of South Africa: (a) economic growth has fallen to around 1.4%; (b) more and more South Africans are constantly and increasingly falling victim to violent crimes; (c) corruption has been established in South Africa as a constant; (d) the promotion of the unity of the nation has been seriously compromised Plouamma asked the speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete to recuse herself from presiding over the debate, but she refused. In that case, Madam Speaker, I decline to move the motion that is printed in my name on the order paper. I withdraw it, Plouamma said.Read the minutes of the proceedings of the National Assembly here.REMOVAL ACCORDING TO CONSTITUTION S SECTION 89Section 89 of the South African Constitution allows for the removal of the president. This is sometimes referred to as impeachment , although that term is not used in the South African constitution.A president can only be removed on the following grounds:a serious violation of the constitution or the law,serious misconduct,inability to perform the functions of the office. Two-thirds of the 400 MPs must support it before the president is removed from office, De Vos said.If a president is removed in this way, he may not receive the usual benefits of the presidency and cannot serve in any public office afterwards.There has been one attempt to remove Zuma in this way.5 April 2016A motion to remove Zuma was proposed by the leader of the opposition, Mmusi Maimane. He listed the following reasons, amongst others, in support of Zuma s removal: Zuma s failure to comply with the remedial action taken by the public protector as set out in her report Secure in Comfort was unlawful and inconsistent with the constitution, Zuma s actions in requesting the police minister Nathi Nhleko to determine the amount he should repay for the costs of upgrading his private home in Nkandla was inconsistent with the public protector s prescribed remedial action and, as a result was inconsistent with the constitution,Zuma had seriously violated the constitution when he undermined the public protector s findings by instituting parallel investigative processes and when he failed to implement the public protector s remedial action ,Zuma s action to appoint Mr Menzi Simelane as the national director of public prosecutions is inconsistent with the constitution and invalid .The motion was put to vote and did not pass.
