JOHANNESBURG - The Freedom of Expression Institute says the acts of victimisation leading up to the death of SABC Senior Journalist Suna Venter symbolise a greater increase in the intimidation of journalists.Venter's family say she died of a condition linked to prolonged periods of unnatural stress.The institute says its saddened by Venter's death and even more aggrieved that her abusers have not been prosecuted.Spokesperson Tusi Fakone said: There are some who think that they can deny others of their freedom of expression knowing that it s unlikely that they will ever be held accountable for their action. And I think in Suna s case as well, I think she was subject to threats, attacks etc. and so far no one has been held accountable. Since testifying about interference at the SABC, Venter was abducted, her house was broken into and her car's breaks were tampered with.She was a part of the &quot;SABC eight&quot; who were dismissed from the public broadcaster for voicing their concerns. The group was later re-instated by the Labour Court.In the last few minutes, the SABC has released a statement.The broadcaster has sent its condolences to venter's family, friends and colleagues.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
