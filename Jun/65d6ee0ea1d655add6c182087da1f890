Among the four is an advocate identified in the Gupta leaks as being selected by the controversial family to sit on the board. JOHANNESBURG - Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi has refused to explain why he s re-appointed four people to the Airports Company of South Africa (Acsa) board who had been removed by his predecessor Dipuo Peters.The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has accused Maswanganyi of irregularly appointing the four.The party wrote to the minister demanding that the group be barred from board meetings pending the finalisation of a judicial review of their appointments.Among the four is an advocate identified in the Gupta leaks as being selected by the controversial family to sit on the board.Maswanganyi confirmed having received the letter from the EFF but dodged a question on whether he s acceded to the demand that the four board members be barred from attending meetings. And we re responding in regard to that case. I don t have to go into details, for an instant that I ve stopped the board meeting, but I ve never convened any board meeting for their ordinary business. So, allow the process to take its own course. Maswanganyi twice ignored Eyewitness News request for him to explain his rationale for the re-appointment of board members who had been removed by his predecessor.He did, however, say he s unaware of any Acsa board member with links to what he termed a business family.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
