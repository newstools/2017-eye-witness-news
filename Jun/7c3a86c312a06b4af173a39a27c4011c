On Monday night, delays of up to two hours left commuters at Cape Town Station frustrated. CAPE TOWN - Metrorail is warning of major delays on all its lines on Tuesday afternoon following a rampage by angry commuters at Cape Town Station on Monday evening. After enduring delays of two hours and more, frustrated commuters turned to violence, torching trains and ransacking shops.  Metrorail says eight train carriages were destroyed in the chaos at Cape Town Train Station. Police have made one arrest after commuters went on a rampage. The rail operator's Richard Walker said: “What we cannot condone is the looting that took place and damage done to smaller shops, particularly two cellular shops that were totally destroyed.” Platforms 15 and 16 at Cape Town Station will be out of use indefinitely due to damage caused by the fire. Golden Arrow Bus Service has stepped in to assist Metrorail commuters.
