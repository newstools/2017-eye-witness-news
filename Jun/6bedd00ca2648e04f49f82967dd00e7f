JOHANNESBURG The Springboks have beaten France 35-12 at Emirates Airlines Park in the third and final test match of the series on Saturday night.Before kick off the pressure was piled onto the South Africans, with captain Warren Whiteley being forced to withdraw through injury at the last minute. Vice-captain Eben Etzebeth was given the armband, and became the 59th player to captain the men in Green and Gold. Defence was once again the order of the day for coach Allister Coetzee s men, with the visitors unable to get over the try line throughout the 80 minutes.South Africa got off to the perfect start thanks to Jesse Kriel who got over the line inside the first 10 minutes after some clever footwork. Flyhalf Elton Jantjies also looked great with the boot, and led the Boks into the halftime tunnel with a 16-9 lead thanks to three penalties and a conversion.The second half got off to the perfect start too, with stand-in captain Eben Etzebeth muscling the ball over the line for the second try of the evening. France should have had more points on the board by the hour mark, with the kicking of Jules Plisson going awry at times.Malcolm Marx added to the visitors woes just after the 60 minute mark when he barged the ball over the line and onto the padding of the posts. With the score at 28-12 to South Africa, the French had to throw caution to the wind, but still couldn t get over the whitewash in the face off another sterling defensive effort from the Boks.As is often the danger with playing an all-out-attack approach, France left themselves open on defence and Rudy Paige showed some outstanding skill to add insult to the French injury as the match closed out.Coach Allister Coetzee will certainly be excited with what his squad has to offer in the future, after making a few changes to the side that won the second test in Durban.
