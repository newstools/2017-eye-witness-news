CAPE TOWN - A 36-year-old man has been sentenced to life behind bars for the murder of a seven-year-old child in Northern Cape. Jan Bester learnt his fate in the De Aar High Court last week. He was found guilty of killing William Duiker in August. The child's body was found next to a railway line shortly after he was reported missing. The police's Dimakatso Mooi says Bester was a friend of the family. The family was adopted by the police in 2014 after it was discovered that they were living in a dumping site after their father was sentenced to jail for murdering their mother. Duiker, the youngest of seven children, was murdered.&quot;
