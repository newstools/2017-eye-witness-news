CAPE TOWN - Law enforcement officials are expected to maintain a heavy presence in the Vrygrond area following protests on Monday.Officials say that the demonstrations stem from a dispute between legal and illegal taxi operators.The City of Cape Town's JP Smith says that the violence then spread to the Capricorn shopping centre where a liquor store was looted.Authorities held a week-long operation in the south Peninsula impounding over 70 vehicles and issuing more than 3,000 fines. That enforcement by itself gets further violence. Unfortunately, it goes hand in hand with public violence and the destruction of property, which we cannot tolerate.
