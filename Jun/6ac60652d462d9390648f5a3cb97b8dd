JOHANNESBURG South African Communist Party (SACP) second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila says most of the people implicated in the Gupta email revelations should step down from their positions, including Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba.The emails, published by the Daily Maverick and amaBhungane, show that Gigaba appointed people to the boards of state-owned enterprises who then helped the Gupta family benefit from state deals.In one case, this meant the family received R10 million for every R50 million locomotive bought by Transnet.Mapaila says those implicated should step down from office. It s clear that those who are implicated should not hold public office, this includes the Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba. He also says these emails prove that the SACP is right to demand that President Jacob Zuma step down.LISTEN: #GuptaLeaks: Cat's out of the bag What now?Meanwhile, the African National Congress says all allegations related to state capture will be scrutinised during a judicial commission appointed to investigate the information that has emerged in recent weeks.The ANC s Zizi Kodwa says a commission will deal with the claims.
