After a two-day federal council meeting held in Durban, Mmusi Maimane stated it's possible to unseat the African National Congress. JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says the road to the 2019 general elections is now open and his party is vetting suitable candidates for various positions.After a two-day federal council meeting held in Durban, Maimane stated it's possible to unseat the African National Congress (ANC) through a coalition government in 2019.Maimane says polling information suggests the ANC currently sits below 50% and that there is a big chance to remove it from power.He says key candidates will now be found to represent the party in 2019. We can dislodge them in 2019 and build a coalition government that will take South Africa towards prosperity. Maimane says the party's main aim is to remove Zuma from office and says the party has welcomed the Constitutional Court's decision to clarify the National Assembly speaker's powers on deciding on a secret ballot in Parliament.Last week, the court ruled Speaker Baleka Mbete was mistaken when she said that neither the Constitution nor parliamentary rules allow her to authorise a secret vote.This came after the United Democratic Movement application for Parliament to hold a motion of no confidence in the president via a secret ballot.Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng clarified Mbete does have the power to allow for a secret ballot. Now that it has been explained that she has the power to that which she is not averse to, she has the properly guided latitude to prescribe what she considers the appropriate voting procedure. Mogoeng added a motion of no confidence would enhance the enforcement of accountability. When all the regular checks and balances seem to be ineffective or a serious accountability breach is sought to have occurred, then the citizens best interest could at times demand a resort to the ultimate accountability ensuring mechanisms.
