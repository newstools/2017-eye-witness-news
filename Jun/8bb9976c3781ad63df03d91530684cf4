Nehawu has accused Parliamentary Secretary Mgidlana of hiring senior staff to his office without approval and issuing questionable tenders, among other things. CAPE TOWN - Tensions are simmering among Parliamentary workers calling for Secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana to be suspended.The National Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) claims he's influencing investigations against him, while Mgidlana says the accusations are unfair and baseless.Last week, Speaker Baleka Mbete said budget cuts were affecting Parliament's ability to pay its wage bill.Nehawu has accused Mgidlana of hiring senior staff to his office without approval, issuing questionable tenders and benefitting from a study bursary to the detriment of lower earning staff.In a statement, Mgidlana has in turn accused Nehawu of shunning wage talks.The union's Sthembiso Tembe said: They are lying by calling for us to go to negotiations because there are no negotiations taking place. If people say they don't have money, then what is there to negotiate? But Mgidlana says despite the budget cuts, he's committed to ensuring parliamentary workers receive a salary increase this year.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
