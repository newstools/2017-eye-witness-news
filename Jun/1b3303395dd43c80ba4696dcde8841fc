We want this to serve as a warning to the police that we are watching [them]. We need police accountability when women have been violated the police need to know what to do. She says more and more women are coming out to report their cases. In any police station, there is supposed to be someone trained to deal with gender-based violence. Makutoane says they are demanding the taxi industry to be regulated as many rapes have been linked to serial rapists targeting female taxi commuters.#WomensAgainstViolence A group of protesting women speaking directly to the police of the Booysens area outside the station.
