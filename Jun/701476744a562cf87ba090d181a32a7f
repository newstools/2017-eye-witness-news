Consensual non-monogamy covers a range of relationship styles that describe open and transparent multiple-partner relationships. Openness and honesty are key to making consensual non-monogamy (CNM) work, says  clinical sexologist Dr Eve. CNM is an umbrella category which includes polyamory, open relationships, swinging, and other consensual alternatives to traditional monogamy. It's any relationship were all people involved openly agree to have more than one, concurrent sexual and or romantic partner.  Dr Eve says CNM as a relationship structure is based on various values such as honesty, transparency and acceptance of sexual attraction to others. She advises that CNM relationships are managed and partners  often negotiate agreement and the terms of engagement. Dr Eve explains that compassion, a positive emotional reaction to a loved one's other relationship, is a common part of CNM and an alternative to jealousy. People who are polyamorous are deeply committed, just to more than one person at the same time.  A few listeners phoned in to the show to explain how they navigate CNM in their relationships.
