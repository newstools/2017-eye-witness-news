The system is used to place newly qualified doctor at hospitals and clinics for community service before they're allowed to practice or open their own surgeries. JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has refuted claims that the department's online placement system has been delayed by three months. The system is used to place newly qualified doctor at hospitals and clinics for community service before they're allowed to practice or open their own surgeries.The Health Department's online system was introduced last year. Shiwrin Prim, who graduated from Wits University in 2015, says that he has finished his internship and only needs to do community service to be able to move on to a level in which he is employable or can start his own practice.He says he is frustrated because the department's system is delayed and is preventing him from being able to move on. Registration that was meant to open on 1 March only opened on 20 April. Applications were meant to open in April as well, according to the website, but these applications have not opened. Motsoaledi says the system is fine and intakes will only start in the beginning of July. There s no way people can be taken in April. The July intake is for people who still have to write their mid-year exams. But Prim says he believes there is something wrong with the new system, or there might be a communication breakdown.
