The party says it will lodge charges against ministers implicated in the State of Capture report, including ministers Faith Muthambi and Lynne Brown. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will be lodging criminal complaints against more ministers it believes are compromised in allegations of state capture this includes Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and Public Administration Minister Faith Muthambi.On Wednesday, the DA will be asking all chief whips to support a motion for an ad hoc committee into state capture before Parliament's recess this month.This comes as President Jacob Zuma on Monday filed a counter-application to the DA's attempt to force him to initiate a judicial commission of inquiry as recommended by the Public Protector's State of Capture report.Parliament's Public Enterprises Committee has already indicated it will initiate an inquiry into Eskom.But the main opposition says a Parliamentary ad hoc committee would be better placed to get to the root of all state capture claims. Each portfolio committee examining the issues around state capture in isolation will not expose the extent of the rot and the massive tentacles of the network that crept into state-owned entities and the executive.&quot;The main dispute between the DA and Zuma is whether his review application has the effect of staying the remedial action ordered by the Public Protector.Zuma is now asking the court that if it finds that the remedial action can only be stayed by a court order, that he be given time to obtain such an order.(Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
