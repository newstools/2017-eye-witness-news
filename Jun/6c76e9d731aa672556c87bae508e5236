JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says Ben Ngubane must still answer to questions about alleged corruption at Eskom despite his sudden resignation from the parastatal. On Monday night, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown announced Ngubane's resignation and the appointment of interim chairperson Zethembe Khoza.The Eskom board says it is shocked by Ngubane s sudden resignation.Ngubane was named in the Public Protector's State of Capture report as well as in the recent leaked Gupta emails. The ANC s Zizi Kodwa says he must be held accountable. If there is any wrongdoing from him or any person, whether they resign or not, they must take responsibility. Allegations of corruption and looting are quite serious. Kodwa adds that the utility now needs stability. We need good corporate governance. The utility must clean itself of corruption allegations because people are saying that our utility has been captured. Recently, Ngubane dismissed allegations by former Mineral Resources Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi that he attempted to force him to suspend the mining licences of coal supplier Glencore.Ngubane dismissed the claims during a conference in Cape Town last month. We can t instruct a minister on what to do. We take our problems to ministers and ask for help. Now for a minister to claim that we made him take a decision on something is preposterous.
