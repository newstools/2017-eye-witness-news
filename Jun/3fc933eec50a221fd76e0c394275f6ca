The bill was signed into law by President Jacob Zumal after he had sent it back to the National Assembly over concerns regarding searches without warrants. JOHANNESBURG Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has signed and gazetted the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (Fica) bill.The bill was signed into law by President Jacob Zuma in April after he had sent it back to the National Assembly over concerns regarding searches without warrants. The law provides for ongoing monitoring of the business relationships, sources of wealth and sources of funds of domestic prominent influential persons, their family members and close associates. The Democratic Alliance (DA) had previously raised its concerns with the implementation of the law, alleging that Gigaba may delay such implementation because of Zuma s close ties to the controversial Gupta family. The minister s spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete said: The minister signed the Fica Bill last week Thursday, and today the department of finance as gazetted it. What we are going to be doing in the next month is taking comment from various groups and members of the public about the Act.
