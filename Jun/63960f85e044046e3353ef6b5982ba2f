Is it Storm Helen, will it wash away racism or will the Western Cape residents be underwhelmed by the storm's force? JOHANNESBURG As Western Cape residents brace themselves for a storm on Wednesday, Twitter is flooded with what it might bring and what it should be named.Heavy rain and gale force wind is forecast for the next 24 hours, with a chance of snowfall.But tweeps feel the need to give the storm a suitable name and Storm Helen (named after the Western Cape Premier Helen Zille) seems to be gaining popularity. And of course, her tweets about the positivity of colonialism have also crept into the conversation.#capestorm what do we call this coming storm? #StormHelen pic.twitter.com/pfqn1lw9V2I suspect this #capestorm was created by the racist madam Zille to get rid of all the "blacks" in the western cape. pic.twitter.com/vNxoyaqGohWhat if Helen Zille has turned into a mermaid and letting out her anger and rage to Mmusi Maimane on Black people via #CapeStorm... The #capestorm should be named after the Premier of WC... Zille#capestorm this storm will hopefully remove makhulu Helen Zille as a premier,heavens are angry pic.twitter.com/Jj1uR2cC2ySo what s the best that can come out of this storm?Schools have already been ordered to close gates on Wednesday, maybe the province will declare it a public holiday.
