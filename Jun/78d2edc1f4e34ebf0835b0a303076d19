The body&#8217;s Omri van Zyl says they now want clarity on the process of how money was allocated. CAPE TOWN Agri-SA has stressed the importance of government's drought relief assistance being applied in an appropriate manner.The Agricultural Industry body has approached the Auditor-General and Public Protector to investigate claims funds earmarked for the relief of farmers affected by drought were underspent by 30%.Agri-SA says it has received some complaints from farmers.Agri SA claims funds have been wasted on service providers who lack expertise in the industry.The body s Omri van Zyl says they now want clarity on the process of how money was allocated. On what basis the allocation was made and was there a specific strategy or was it just a haphazard allocation? The second I think is the service providers who were used because we generally have the idea of who s who in the agricultural sector. The departments of Water and Sanitation, as well as Rural Development and Land Reform, say they assisted farmers with funds from their budgets and did not receive funds from Treasury for this purpose.The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries was unavailable for comment.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
