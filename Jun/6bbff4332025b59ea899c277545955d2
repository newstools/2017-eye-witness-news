Immediately when the service was transferred over to the Department of Health in Gauteng according to the DG, the danger allowance was something that was destroyed and the dissection allowance was also no longer there. Kopane says the department has revealed that random unqualified staff has been conducting postmortems. Going forward, they end up doing the real job of the pathologists, sometimes it happens not under the supervision of and that s where the problem lies. The department's Joe Maila has declined to comment on the issue until he consults with the director general.
