This follows an investigation against Rooibos Limited, the largest processor of the South African tea, after a complaint from a local processor in 2015. JOHANNESBURG The Competition Commission has approached the Competition Tribunal for an order declaring that Rooibos Limited has violated market laws.This follows an investigation against Rooibos Limited, the largest processor of the South African tea, after a complaint from a local processor in 2015.The commission s investigation focused on the company s monopolisation of rooibos tea supply from commercial farmers in order to prevent the expansion of its rivals in the processing market.There are about 220 commercial rooibos tea farmers, all based in the rooibos producing areas in the Western and Northern Cape, but only a limited number of commercial rooibos tea farmers contribute the bulk of the total production of rooibos tea which is supplied to Rooibos Tea processors.The Competition Commission says that in 2014, Rooibos Limited introduced two exclusionary contracting strategies to lock-in or foreclose the supply of rooibos tea from farmers and thus starving its competitors of access to a product that only grows in a small geographic region.The commission s Sipho Ngwema says: Because they re big, they have forced many farmers to supply only them and other competitors are not getting rooibos. The commission is seeking an order from the tribunal declaring that Rooibos Limited has contravened the Competition Act and that the company is liable to pay an administrative penalty equal to 10% of its annual turnover.
