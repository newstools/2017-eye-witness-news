Malema says if the president doesn't withdraw the application, he must agree that all parties can approach the court to ask for the hearing to be brought forward. JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the party has asked President Jacob Zuma to withdraw his application to review the Public Protector's state of capture report - or else his party will head to court. Malema briefed the media in Braamfontein earlier where he also revealed alleged corruption at Transnet worth R17.4 billion apparently involving key figures like Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe and the Gupta family.Julius Malema says given the recent revelations contained in the Gupta email leaks - it s clear a commission of inquiry must be established sooner rather than later. We have instructed our lawyers this morning to send a letter to Zuma demanding that in the next few days he should withdraw his review application. He says if the president doesn't withdraw, he must agree that all parties can approach the Pretoria High Court judge president to ask for the hearing to be brought forward to July. Should he fail to accept our demand then the EFF will have no option but to approach the court for an early date on the grounds that the matter has now become urgent. Malema has also revealed the EFF is also in possession of the Gupta emails and that the party's security department is going through each and every one of them.He says after that process, the EFF will compile a dossier and submit it to Parliament, seeking the impeachment of MPs involved.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
