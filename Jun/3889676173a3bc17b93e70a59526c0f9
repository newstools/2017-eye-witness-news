The Constitutional Court ruled that Speaker Baleka Mbete is empowered by parliamentary rules to allow for a secret ballot. JOHANNESBURG - National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete will now have to decide whether to hold a motion of no confidence in the President Jacob Zuma in secret.The Constitutional Court ruled on Thursday morning that the Speaker is empowered by parliamentary rules to allow for a secret ballot.The United Democratic Movement (UDM) and other opposition parties approached the court in May to give Parliament a go ahead to vote in secret.The argument by Mbete that she doesn't have the discretion or is under no obligation to allow for a secret ballot has been dealt a blow.Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said: &quot;The Speaker says that neither the Constitution nor the rules of the National Assembly allow her to authorise a vote by secret ballot. To this extent, she was mistaken. Our interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the rules make it clear, that the Speaker does have the power to authorise a vote by a secret ballot in a motion of no confidence in the president in appropriate circumstances was invalid and must be set aside.&quot;Mogoeng also made it clear the court can't decide for Mbete what decision to take, whatever it is must be rational and Mbete must take it in the spirit of ensuring accountability of the executive. It is her judgment call to make, having due regard to what would be the best procedure to ensure that members exercise their oversight powers most effectively. The Chief Justice says Speaker Mbete must use the existing parliamentary rules to decide on whether to have a motion of no confidence against the president in secret or not. Rules 103 and 104 do empower the Speaker to have a motion of no confidence in the president voted on by secret ballot. The court says because Mbete has indicated she has never been opposed to a secret ballot, now that the rules have been clarified to give her powers to hold it, she must make a fresh decision on a proper and rational basis .Meanwhile, Parliament has confirmed it has already received a request from the DA for the speaker to arrange for a motion of no confidence in the president.WATCH: Constitutional Court rulingANC RESPONDSThe African National Congress (ANC) has described the UDM s application as frivolous and vexatious.The party has welcomed the ruling, saying the court will not decide how Mbete exercises her discretion.The ANC has also expressed its confidence that the speaker will apply her mind before she takes any decision.ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu says his party will make sure that the judgment is obeyed and that they will not object to a plan to hold a vote by secret ballot.But Mthembu says they know that their MPs will vote to keep President Zuma in power.He says Mbete now has to take this issue to Parliament's rules committee. As part of that multi-party forum, we will not be found wanting, we will not be obstructionists to any views that say there must be a secret ballot to this matter.
