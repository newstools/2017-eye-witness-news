PRETORIA Polls have opened in Lesotho for voters casting their ballots for the third time since 2012.Frontrunners are Pakalitha Mosisili, who s seven-party collapsed last March and Thomas Thabane who was forced to flee a coup attempt in 2014.The big questions looming over this snap election are whether voting will proceed peacefully and whether the citizens of the mountain kingdom will return a government, able to restore stability to tackle poverty and unemployment.Thabane, leading the All Basotho Congress, is seen as a narrow favourite to win the prime ministerial position he lost in 2015.However, there are fears of protests if Mosisili, who heads the Democratic Congress, is beaten and refuses to concede power.Early crowds lining up to vote in ice cold Maseru morning #LesothoVotes2017 -' polls open at 7am pic.twitter.com/WmWAibFlN4
