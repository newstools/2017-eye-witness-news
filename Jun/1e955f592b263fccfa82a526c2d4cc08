The US Department of Homeland Security issued a statement late Saturday saying At this time, we have no information to indicate a specific, credible terror threat in the United States.

All Americans stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in the statement.Trump was briefed earlier about the London Bridge incident by his national security team, according to White House spokesman Sean Spicer, who said on Twitter that security officials would continue providing the president with updates.The State Department also said it was monitoring the situation and advised Americans in Britain to heed the advice of local authorities and maintain their security awareness.Law enforcement officials in major US cities said they were not aware of any threats but were on alert.
