The emails show the Guptas allegedly hand-picked Mosebenzi Zwane as mineral resources minister a month before he was appointed. JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has given his first reaction to the Gupta leaks, saying he's being attacked because he's black.Zwane was speaking on the sidelines of the Black Economic Advisory Council workshop in Pretoria.The emails show that the Guptas allegedly hand-picked Zwane as mineral resources minister a month before he was appointed by the President.The Democratic Alliance has accused Zwane of breaching the Executive Member s Ethics Act by failing to declare his trip to India in October 2012.It s alleged in leaked Gupta emails that the family paid for the trip as a reward after Zwane successfully pushed the Free State provincial government to give Gupta-affiliated company Estina a 4,400-hectare farm, along with R114 million in funding a few months prior.Zwane says the allegations in the emails have hurt him. It s painful because it always happens to black people. But he says he has not seen the emails. I ve not even seen one email. It would have been nice if these people who are alleging would post these emails. He says he s happy that four parliamentary oversight committees have been instructed to probe accusations of state capture revealed in the leaked emails.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
