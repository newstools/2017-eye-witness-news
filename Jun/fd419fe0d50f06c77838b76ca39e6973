All of his previous good faith attempts have thus far been to no avail.&quot;DA has suspended me. They have agreed I can share my reasons why I should not have been suspended. Here they are: https://t.co/6h6MqdjrOLFederal executive chairperson of the party James Selfe says the hope is that through the disciplinary hearings the matter can be dealt with outside of the wider debate within the party. What we re seeking to do with the suspension is to insulate and isolate this particular disciplinary hearing from a broader debate within the party. I think it s in the interest of justice and Zille that we separate the issue of her comments and the consequences of those comments from a broader debate within the party. Zille fell foul of DA leadership following tweets in which she suggested colonialism offered many benefits to South Africa.LISTEN: Helen Zille puts DA on back foot over suspension
