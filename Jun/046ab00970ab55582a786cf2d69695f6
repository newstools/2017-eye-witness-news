This is if all goes according to schedule in the construction of "The Pinnacle" twin glass-facade towers that will rise above Nairobi. CAPE TOWN – Johannesburg’s 223 metre Carlton Centre is in danger of losing its title as the tallest building in Africa. This is if all goes according to schedule in the construction of “The Pinnacle” twin glass-facade towers that will rise above Nairobi, Kenya. The buildings are set for completion by December 2019. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta recently laid the foundation stone ahead of the mammoth construction project of the 300 meters tall building. The towers will house a 255-room Hilton Hotel, along with elite residences, business and leisure facilities, and a helipad on the roof of the taller tower. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
