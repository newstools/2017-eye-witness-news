The EFF have reacted to reports of alleged espionage by the Guptas on its leader, linking it to Malusi Gigaba. JOHANNESBURG The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has warned the controversial Gupta family that the party will take them on 'toe to toe'.In the face of concerns over the safety of its leader, the red berets claim the Guptas have definitely been spying on Julius Malema.The party says the family has access to the travel details and id number of the party leader.The Sunday Times is also reporting that leaked documents have revealed the Gupta family has apparently been spying on some of South Africa s top banking bosses.Eff spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the party will be taking the evidence found in the leaked emails to the inspector general of intelligence.Ndlozi says it s clear this information was obtained from the home affairs department during the time Malusi Gigaba was the minister. The time when Malusi Gigaba, who is their number one stooge, was the home affairs minister we have no doubt that he had a hand in that, or his department for that matter. We know for sure that the persons that are spying on the CIC (Malema) is the government itself.
