HARARE - The Zimbabwean government has selected a Chinese firm to provide equipment for a new voter registration exercise ahead of next year s elections.But the main opposition MDC has objected, saying the selection of the Chinese firm over a German competitor is biased.This new biometric voter registration exercise is a critical part of ensuring free and fair elections in 2018.Two companies were vying to supply the electronic equipment needed to compile the fresh voters roll ahead of elections to be held in about a year's time.One company was from Germany, the other was Laxton Group from China.Opposition spokesman Obert Gutu says the MDC is worried that the Chinese firm selected could be more easily manipulated, given Zanu-PF s strong ties with China.The spokesman says Laxton itself may not be unprofessional and indeed its services are cheaper but it does appear clear that Zanu-PF is more comfortable with the Chinese option.
