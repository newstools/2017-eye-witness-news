Proposed developments on some parts of the land occupied by the Philippi Horticultural Area have been at the centre of disputes between activists and the City of Cape Town. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Agriculture Department has committed itself to ensuring the sustainability of the Philippi Horticultural Area (PHA). This emerged when the department briefed the Western Cape Legislature's standing committee on agriculture on Wednesday Proposed developments on some parts of the land have been at the centre of disputes between activists and the City of Cape Town. Committee Chairperson Beverley Schafer says the department has become more involved in the matter. There was a meeting with stakeholders, the City of Cape Town, to come together and say how are we going to take this forward in a way that everybody is on the same page, that it s not the city versus the province, that really the programme is in the best interest of the Philippi Horticultural Area. Schafer adds the department has made its intentions clear. The Agriculture Department has a firm stance and that is to preserve and protect the PHA as a highly productive horticulture area and the future for food and nutrition security for the Western Cape, so they will not move from that.
