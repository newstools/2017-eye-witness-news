On Tuesday, the Labour Court ruled that the DA and the EFF could intervene as interested parties. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it's important that it s been granted access to intervene in former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe's case given that it has a parallel application which seeks to set aside his re-appointment as irrational.On Tuesday, the Labour Court ruled that the DA and the EFF could intervene as interested parties.Molefe is challenging the decision by the Eskom board to rescind his reappointment. His application to the Labour Court is now set to go ahead on Thursday. The opposition parties had argued that it was inappropriate for the Labour Court to hear Molefe's application because the matter is already pending in the High Court.The DA's James Selfe said: We're here to win in the Labour Court. It would make things very complicated for the High Court application which is only going to be heard in August. So we will be back in court on Thursday at which the substantive case will be argued.
