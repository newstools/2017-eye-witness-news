Mashaba&#8217;s relationship with his employers had deteriorated in 2016 after he failed to meet one of his mandates, which was to guide Bafana to the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. JOHANNESBURG - The legal battle between the South African Football Association and former Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba is finally over, with both parties reaching an amicable agreement.Mashaba took South African Football Association (SAFA) to the CCMA earlier this year, claiming wrongful dismissal, following his sacking in December, for what the association deemed gross misconduct.The 66-year-old had a public outburst, allegedly directed at his employers, following Bafana's 2-1 win over Senegal in their World Cup qualifier in November, which was caught on live TV.Mashaba s relationship with his employers had deteriorated in 2016 after he failed to meet one of his mandates, which was to guide Bafana to the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon).His tenure was further marred by his unsavoury relationship with the media, whom he was in constant clash with, at times even publicly criticising for what he believed to be negative reporting about him and his team.The former national youth coach was appointed Bafana coach in 2014, replacing Gordon Igesund and enjoyed instant success, leading South Africa to the 2015 Afcon without losing a match in the qualifiers.The team didn t fare well at the tournament out in Equatorial Guinea, losing two matches and drawing one, against Senegal.Mashaba was replaced by SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter on 3 May, who was returning to the job for the second time.Mashaba s lawyer, Claudio Bollo, says it was unfortunate that the case took this long to reach a resolution. Obviously, a lot of heartache, legal fees, time spent and difficulties could have been avoided. But the bottom line is sometimes court cases need to run for a while.Bollo adds that the coach would ve loved to fulfil his mandate and take the national to the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The regret the coach has is that it led to him not being able to take South Africa to the world cup in 2018, but he s a strong and motivated man and he will box forward and do his best. South Africa will take on Nigeria in the 2019 Afcon qualifier in Uyo on 10 June, their first official match since Mashaba s axing.
