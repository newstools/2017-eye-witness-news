The organisation released a report which it claims contains enough evidence to remove President Jacob Zuma from power. CAPE TOWN The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it is considering taking legal action against individuals accused of state capture.The organisation released a report which it claims contains enough evidence to remove President Jacob Zuma from power.The document details alleged illegal dealings between the Gupta family, Zuma, his son Duduzane, and an array of ministers.Outa s Wayne Duvenage says: Yes there s a lot of incriminating evidence. Yes, there are reasons to bring criminal charges against individuals implicated in this document and yes we ll be pursuing some of those. We also know that other civil society organisations and we also know that political parties are doing the same. Meanwhile, Parliament has confirmed it s received a state capture dossier from Outa ahead of a proposed vote on a motion of no confidence in Zuma.The dossier contains Outa s own research, the findings of the Public Protector and revelations contained in the Gupta leaks.Outa says the dossier shows that Zuma is a compromised president who allowed corrupt individuals to benefit from state coffers.The organisation is hoping that the report will be tabled for discussion by the National Assembly.But Parliament s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the issue of state capture is already on the legislature s agenda. The committees of Parliament are busy with the investigation into those matters. They re engaging with various departmental representatives. Four portfolio committees have been directed to investigate claims contained in the Gupta emails.Mothapo says that Speaker Baleka Mbete will apply her mind to Outa s report.Last week, the Constitutional Court ruled that Speaker Baleka Mbete was mistaken to think she doesn't have the power to allow a secret ballot in Parliament.Duvenage says: There is an interesting debate about what are the pros and cons of an open or a closed ballot either way, we believe the evidence we have given compels the members of Parliament to move in the right direction.&quot;We favour a secret ballot, but if it's no secret ballot, we don t believe it's the end.
