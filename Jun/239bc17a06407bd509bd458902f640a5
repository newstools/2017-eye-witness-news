DOUALA - Two suicide bombers killed nine other people and wounded 30 on Friday near a camp in northern Cameroon housing civilians displaced by Nigeria's Boko Haram militants, the region's governor and other officials said.The bombers - both men - entered the town of Kolofata, around 10 kilometres from the border with Nigeria, before dawn on Friday, posing as refugees looking for food before the start of the daytime fast for Ramadan.&quot;Once among the population, they detonated their explosives, one after the other. The official death toll is 11, including the two suicide bombers, and 30 wounded,&quot; Mindjiyawa Bakary, governor of Cameroon's Far North region, told Reuters.A local government official said 10 of the wounded had been transported to a hospital in a nearby town with serious injuries.&quot;It was unbearable. People were screaming. Others were moaning. It was total horror,&quot; said a policeman present at the scene of the bombing.Northern Cameroon has in recent years suffered from the overflow of violence linked to Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamist insurgents.
