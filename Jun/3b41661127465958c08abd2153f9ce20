JOHANNESBURG - Public schools will now have to amend policies to ensure any one religion is not favoured over others.On Wednesday, the High Court in Johannesburg ruled that government schools cannot promote one religion to the exclusion of others.The case was brought by the Organisation for Religious Education and Democracy (OGOD) which argued that there's religious bias in South African public schools.Judge Willem van der Linde has ruled that public schools cannot favour any one religion.However, religious observances may be conducted as long as they are equitable and attendance is free and voluntary.The African Christian Democratic Party' s Kenneth Meshoe says this means parents have a say. What has come out today is that it has not been undermined. So parents have a right, school governing bodies have the right to choose the religious policy of the school so we are happy about it.
