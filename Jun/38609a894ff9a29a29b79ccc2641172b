Costa, who was at Spanish side Atletico Madrid from 2010-14, wants a move back to the La Liga club but would have to wait for their transfer ban to end next January.

Conte has sent me a message to tell me I am not in his plans for Chelsea, Costa told reporters after Spain s 2-2 draw against Colombia on Wednesday. My relationship with the coach has been bad this season. It s a shame, but it s clear that the coach does not count on me and he does not want me there. Costa, who was at Spanish side Atletico Madrid from 2010-14, wants a move back to the La Liga club but would have to wait for their transfer ban to end next January.His hopes of playing for Spain in next year s World Cup in Russia would also depend on getting regular playing time. Being five months without playing? I do not know, it s complicated, but people know that I love Atletico a lot and that I love to live in Madrid, Costa added. It would be nice to go back, but it s difficult to be four or five months without playing. It s a World Cup year and there are many things to think about. I need to play, just that.
