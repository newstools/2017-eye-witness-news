Israel Folau and winger Henry Speight each scored a brace of tries as Australia opened their season with a dominant win over a gallant Fiji. MELBOURNE - Livewire fullback Israel Folau and winger Henry Speight each scored a brace of tries as Australia opened their season with a dominant 37-14 win over a gallant Fiji on Saturday.Folau ended an 11-match scoring drought for the Wallabies dating back to last June s internationals against England, while Speight proved the villain for the country of his birth, with his second and third test tries.Dropped skipper Stephen Moore came on as a replacement to grab Australia s other try, with wingers Vereniki Goneva and Timocui Nagusa crossing for the visitors late on a glorious afternoon at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium. I thought it wasn t too bad, we won t get carried away with it all though, said coach Michael Cheika, whose Wallabies also host Italy and Scotland this month. I thought we worked hard in defence. They wanted to play, the lads, still going after the whistle. It was a good start but plenty to work on. Cheika had unveiled a new-look Wallabies side, with hooker Moore dropped to the bench in favour of Tatafu Polota-Nau, and two debutants in former rugby league international Karmichael Hunt and blindside flanker Ned Hanigan.Away from his regular fullback position, Hunt enjoyed a solid debut as the second playmaker at inside centre, defending fiercely and linking well with his fellow backs in front of a disappointing crowd of 13,583.Folau gave Australia the perfect start, soaring above Fiji fullback Kini Murimurivalu at the right corner to bring down a lofted Bernard Foley crosskick and score in the fourth minute.Speight blew out the lead to 15-0 with his adopted country s second try after quick hands set up the winger for a three-metre dash down the right touch-line.Folau was sin-binned in the 19th minute for a high tackle but the Fijians were unable to take advantage, with a try to scrumhalf Nikola Matawalu cancelled out because Hooper had been obstructed.Australia were also wasteful, with Foley botching a try opportunity with a poor pass after intercepting the ball and sprinting up field deep into the opposition 22.The Fijians again missed a chance for points two minutes before the break, with Ben Volavola missing a shot at goal to send the Wallabies into halftime with an 18-0 lead.The visitors almost suffered another body blow from one of their own when Tevita Kuridrani crossed at the right corner 10 minutes after the break but a video review showed the Fiji-born outside centre s foot had clipped the touch-line.Folau made no mistake at the same corner five minutes later, however, taking a neat, short pass from Foley at midfield and racing away from the Fijian cover defence.The visitors finally scored in the 63rd minute when Goneva galloped through a gaping hole in the Wallabies defensive line to cross.Their joy was short-lived, however, with Moore crashing over a few minutes later off the back of a rolling maul.Winger Nagusa dived out of a ruck over the line to claim another try but the Pacific islanders suffered the final indignity when Speight scampered over in the right corner for the final try.
