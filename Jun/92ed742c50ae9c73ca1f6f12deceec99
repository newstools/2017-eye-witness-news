Cyril Ramaphosa tells Eyewitness News he supports the Constitutional Court&#8217;s ruling and that the Speaker can't hide behind the veil that she doesn&#8217;t know what to do. JOHANNESBURG Deputy President Cyril Ramaphos a says he trusts that National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete will come to a well thought out decision after last week s Constitutional Court ruling that said she has the power to decide on a secret ballot.On Thursday, the highest court ruled that Mbete has the power to decide on the ballot in the proposed no-confidence vote in President Jacob Zuma.The matter was brought by the United Democratic Movement, Economic Freedom Fighters and Congress of the People last month.Ramaphosa tells Eyewitness News he supports the Constitutional Court s ruling and that Mbete cannot now hide behind the veil that she doesn t know what to do. She also can t hide behind the veil of saying 'I don t have the power'. So it s good when we clarify things I guess in our country so that an independent institution like the Constitutional Court clarifies it and decides it for us. After all, that s what they are there for, they are the final arbiter. On Thursday, the court ruled that Mbete was mistaken when she said that neither the Constitution nor parliamentary rules allow her to authorise a secret vote.Ramaphosa says although the matter ended up in the courts, he does not think it was a waste of time.Meanwhile, Ramaphosa has described South Africa as a plane that is going through turbulence but that it will prosper.
