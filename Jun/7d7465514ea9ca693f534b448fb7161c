Wolwerivier residents claim Ward 104 Councillor Lubabalo Makeleni has been making empty promises since 2015 and has failed to address service delivery. CAPE TOWN - A ward councillor in Wolwerivier has denied allegations levelled against him by Wolwerivier residents and a fellow councillor in the area.Wolwerivier residents claim Lubabalo Makeleni, councillor of ward 104, has been making empty promises since 2015 and has failed to address service delivery issues which include the installation of street lights.Cape Town Council Speaker Dirk Smit has confirmed his office is investigating two complaints against Makeleni, one of which was lodged by Wolwerivier residents in February.Makeleni says the other complaint is by a PR councillor who claims Makeleni uses meetings to bash white people, but he has denied these claims. [Apparently] Every time when I speak I speak of white areas, white councillors, white monopoly capital. And I do not respect the chairperson of the sub-council and I am disrespecting her. And all of that. That s what the letter says. That s what the complaint says. Makeleni adds he is unaware of the complaint from the residents. Two weeks ago, I was in Wolwerivier and there were no grievances that were forwarded to me. But I know about the issues that are very challenging in Wolwerivier, like the issue of lights which we are addressing with the city and Eskom. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
