Zille has been suspended from party activities over the tweets she penned in March in which she defended certain aspects of colonialism. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Western Cape Premier Helen Zille s tweets on colonialism have damaged the party s reputation.Zille has been suspended from party activities over the tweets she penned in March in which she defended certain aspects of colonialism.Party leader, Mmusi Maimane, lodged a complaint against Zille. The premier will still face a disciplinary hearing.Maimane s spokesperson Graham Charters says: And whether it s Helen Zille or anyone else if that project is derailed by comments, by actions then it s the leader s responsibility to act and that s what Mr Maimane did. The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says the suspension of the former DA leader shows the party is fragmented.The ANC s Khaya Magaxa says: If the DA can t deal with its own internal decisions or processes, we as the ANC, we ve got no choice but to raise a vote of no confidence against Zille. LISTEN: Helen Zille responds to DA suspensionZILLE REMAINS DEFIANTZille publicised her response less than an hour after the DA confirmed it has suspended her from party related activities pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing.The party s spokesperson Graham Charters said: She was given an opportunity to make representations as to why she should not be suspended, that deadline was at 5pm on Tuesday. The DA federal executive then met this morning (Wednesday) and deliberated through the day as to whether Ms Zille should be officially suspended just moments ago that decision was finalised and gave effect to her suspension immediately. Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) say Zille should be removed as premier of Cape Town.The party said any suspension that does not have an implication on her position as premier is futile and irrelevant to the rest of the people.The EFF said if Zille is found to have breached her oath of office she would not be representing DA constituents but rather, what they say, are her racist views.EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the party says the DA has demonstrated its incapacity for administering justice and prioritising the people of South Africa. The DA, if it wants us to take them seriously as a party capable of administering justice, they have to remove her and allow her to defy their call then. They must tell her You are suspended, you are to immediately get out as premier until such time that your DC is concluded. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
