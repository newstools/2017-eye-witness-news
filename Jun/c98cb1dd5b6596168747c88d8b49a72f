JOHANNESBURG The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) has acknowledged Western Cape Premier Helen Zille s latest apology and says the decision to remove her from party positions is a step in the right direction.On Monday, the Democratic Alliance (DA) announced that Zille will vacate all positions she held on decision-making structures, including the federal executive, federal council and provincial council.She was suspended for bringing the DA into disrepute over her tweets praising certain aspects of colonialism.Fedusa s acting general secretary Riefdah Ajam says the removal of Zille from the premiership can be addressed through the DA's political processes. Naturally, within the party political positions, that would be governed by their own processes. But to have her removed from all the decision making structures is possibly the best step in the right direction.&quot;WATCH: Helen Zille apologises for tweets on colonialism
