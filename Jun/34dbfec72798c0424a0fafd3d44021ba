Mayco member for water and waste services Xanthea Limberg says the city needs more rain. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has reiterated to residents that stringent water restrictions remain in place despite some rain falling in the Mother City.Due to a cold front that hit parts of the Western Cape and the peninsula, last week dam levels increased from just over 19 percent to 21.2 percent.The municipality has set a target of 500 million litres per day collective use for all residents by the end of July but current consumption is at around 615 million litres a day.Mayco member for water and waste services Xanthea Limberg says this is falling short. We still need to work hard to reduce our consumption because we would be able to build up our reserves using the rain we receive during winter because unfortunately, we won t receive a substantial amount of rain in the summer. Limberg adds the city needs more rain. The dam levels have only increased by 1.6 percent. We require a substantial amount of rain to fully recover from the drought.
