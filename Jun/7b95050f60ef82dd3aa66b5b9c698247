Helen Zille faces an internal disciplinary hearing in Cape Town on Friday after being suspended from all party activities following her controversial tweets defending colonialism. JOHANNESBURG Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the Democratic Alliance (DA) is tiptoeing around Western Cape leader Helen Zille.Zille faces an internal disciplinary hearing in Cape Town on Friday after being suspended from all party activities following her controversial tweets defending colonialism.Malema says the DA should get rid of her. Our problem is that now the DA wants to do what the ANC is doing by walking around Helen Zille, even when there are clear indications that Helen Zille tweeted offensive things against South Africans. Earlier this week, the DA's Federal Executive Committee decided to suspend Zille over the debacle after she failed to provide reasons as to why she shouldn't be. She does, however, remain in her position as Western Cape premier.The provincial ANC has expressed their unhappiness over the tweets, saying it plans on tabling a motion of no confidence in her premiership.The DA's committee will start with the party's disciplinary proceedings against the former party leader.The outcome of her hearing will also have no effect on her provincial position.Meanwhile, Malema says his party s decision to form coalition governments in many metros across the country have so far worked but he s raised concerns over Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip, calling him racially arrogant.
