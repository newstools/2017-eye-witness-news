The SACCA's President Zazi Nsibanyoni-Mugambi says it is meeting with SAA management on Friday afternoon to try and resolve their issue without going on strike on Monday. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) has issued South African Airways (SAA) with a strike notice which has since been halted pending urgent talks with the employer. In April, 50 international and domestic flights had to be cancelled when cabin crew members went on a strike. A dispute over international meal allowances has not yet been resolved and this resulted in the union obtaining a certificate of non-resolution from the CCMA. Staff wants their meal allowance to increase to $170 per day. The SACCA's President Zazi Nsibanyoni-Mugambi said the association was meeting with SAA management on Friday afternoon to try and resolve their issue without going on strike on Monday. We have to be hopeful and we have to be open to negotiations. We know what it caused last time and we obviously don t want to just inspect such damage but we want to honestly engage. I mean we bend over backwards and I think this time they really need to come to the table. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
