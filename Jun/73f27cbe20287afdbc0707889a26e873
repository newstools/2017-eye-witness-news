Masutha says the appeals court sought to balance the accused's right to a fair trial with media freedom. CAPE TOWN - Justice Minister Michael Masutha says he welcomes the balance struck in a Supreme Court of Appeal ruling regarding the broadcast of the murder trial of Henri van Breda. Van Breda is on trial for the axe murders of his parents and older brother. His younger sister was severely wounded in the attack in their Stellenbosch home in January 2015. The court has ruled a request to broadcast the trial be reconsidered by the High Court, which earlier this year granted Media24 permission to live stream the trial. Masutha says the Appeals Court sought to balance the accused's right to a fair trial with media freedom. I think that in this instance, the principle that has been enunciated is that in the event where there is strong competition between the two, the courts must be fair to giving precedence to the right to fair trial, which we completely agree with.
