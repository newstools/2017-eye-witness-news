The Christian View Network&#8217;s Philip Rosenthal, says school governing bodies should have the freedom to decide on the issue. JOHANNESBURG While many public schools now have to revise their policies on religion, the Christian View Network says it disagrees with Wednesday s High Court ruling on the matter.The South Gauteng High Court handed down a ruling saying that schools can t promote any one religion to the exclusion of others.The case was brought by the Organisation for Religious Education and Democracy which argued that there s religious bias in many of South Africa s state schools.The court found that religious observance can be conducted by schools if it is equitable.But the Christian View Network s Philip Rosenthal, says that school governing bodies should have the freedom to decide on the issue. The way that this decision is made, that is the thing that needs to be on an equitable basis. If the pupils do not like the policy of the school, they should be allowed to opt out. And so we fully support that and that s what been the policy for many decades and we agree with it.
