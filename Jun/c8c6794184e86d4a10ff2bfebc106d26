JOHANNESBURG - The mother of Thembisile Yende has appealed to her killers to provide details of her murder so that she can find closure.Yende's body was found at an Eskom substation in Springs last month. It s emerged that her body was dumped at the substation after she was killed elsewhere. Last week, colleague David Ngwenya was arrested and charged with premeditated murder for her murder.Thembisile Yende's mother, Nesta, says while her body has been found, she cannot obtain real closure because she does not know where her daughter took her last breath. The death certificate is wrong. That s the day I found my daughter but her body was already decomposed. Let the murderers tell me when they killed her so that I can have a good record. She says she wants justice. I say no to murderers. No bail to murderers. Let the justice serve. A judgement on bail is due to be handed down on Thursday. (Edited by Zinhe Nkosi)
