The trust fund says if the victims of Marikana were important to the state much more assistance would have been given by now. JOHANNESBURG The Marikana Massacre Amcu Trust Fund says the government is not prioritising the widows and families of the slain mine workers.The trust fund says if the victims of Marikana were important to the state much more assistance would have been given by now.The fund on Saturday revealed 34 houses being built for families in Mqanduli in the Eastern Cape.One house was handed over to the family of Mgcineni Noki, popularly known as the Man in the Green Blanket.After the Marikana massacre in August 2012, Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) established a trust fund to address the three key pillars of housing, education and skills development to assist the relatives of the families.The Marikana Massacre Amcu Trust Fund says during the Farlam Commission of Inquiry it committed to building houses for the families affected by the Marikana massacre.President of Amcu Joseph Mathunjwa says they are still developing initiatives on the other pillars of education and skills development. What is it that can be built around Eastern Cape where it can assist many students or children around the area? Mathunjwa says they hope other stakeholders will assist with funding. There are no resources. I believe that solidly there will be a good Samaritan that will be coming forth and assist. The trust fund says building homes is about providing dignity, social security and stability for the families of the victims.
