CAPE TOWN - The recovery of earth's whale population seems to be going swimmingly, according to a marine biologist. Whale and oceans expert Ken Findlay has told experts at Africa's first World Whale Conference, which is being held in Durban, that the whale population is steadily growing. This growth comes after three centuries of relentless whale killings by humans, wiping out about two million whales. Findlay says research has shown those populations that can be monitored, like the southern right whales found along the South African coastline, have shown remarkable growth. We ve southern right whales increasing just under 7% a year. We ve got humpback whales in the west Indian population increasing at about 10% a year. We ve got things like big Antarctic blue whales starting to signs show of increases. Although it s not all populations, some of these populations are showing remarkable resilience. Findlay has attributed the growth to a societal mindset change which led to the implementation of conservation laws. There has been a shift in the way people have thought about whales. If you look at how people valued whales in the 50s as a resource, compared to in the 80s as an icon of the constellation movement, that was a huge swing in attitude.
