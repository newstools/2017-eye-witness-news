Mediation efforts between the Home Affairs Department and unions over working hours have reached a stalemate. JOHANNESBURG - Mediation efforts between the Home Affairs Department and unions over working hours have reached a stalemate. Unions have now served the department with a strike notice for 19 June. Employees at the Home Affairs Department have been locked in ongoing discussions around Saturday shifts.While unions have demanded that workers be paid overtime for working on Saturdays, the department says it s not in a financial position to meet that demand. The department says if staff work on a Saturday they re given a Wednesday off in exchange. Home Affairs Director-General Mkuseli Apleni said: The unions are against the department opening its doors on Saturdays. They want us to only open from Monday to Friday. We can t do that because we ve been operating on Saturdays from 2004. How are we going to tell the public that the Home Affairs Department is no longer operating on Saturdays?
