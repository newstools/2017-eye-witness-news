The DA remains, in our view, a white supremacist party. It can t divorce itself from racism because Helen Zille is not the first person or leader of the DA to praise colonialism or apartheid there are many others before her. The ANC says her apology is not enough.Kodwa added: Including the fact that we now know that the funders threatened to pull out if Helen Zille was removed and that is why other supporters in the Western Cape have approached Zille to form her own party if she s removed.
