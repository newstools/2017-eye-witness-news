ANC&#8217;s Zizi Kodwa says he hopes people are bold enough to come forward with information when a Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is appointed. JOHANNESBURG - Political parties are pushing for a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, as more explosive emails between the Guptas and their associates continue to lift the lid on the extent of the family s influence over state-owned entities (SOEs) and several ministers. In a joint amaBhungane and Daily Maverick expos between 100 and 200,000 emails and documents reveal the Guptas dealings with SOE s, how the family has been pocketing billions of rands through dubious transactions and Malusi Gigaba s apparent hand in fast tracking documents. The Times Media Group revealed on Sunday that President Jacob Zuma had written to rulers in the UAE, explaining that he planned to relocate to Dubai.Zuma has flatly denied the claim.The African National Congress's Zizi Kodwa says he hopes people are bold enough to come forward with information when a Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is appointed. Hopefully everybody who s got information of allegations will be bold enough to bring it to light. The Economic Freedom Fighters says the commission cannot be appointed by President Zuma alone, especially in a situation where he may be subject to investigation. The Democratic Alliance says it s submitting an affidavit to the police, asking for Anoj Singh, the current chief financial officer of Eskom, to be included in charges of corruption and racketeering that it's laid against Zuma and others. The party says when he was at Transnet, Singh was implicated in a R1.8 billion deal with Neotel, which allegedly benefitted the Guptas to the tune of R36 million.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
