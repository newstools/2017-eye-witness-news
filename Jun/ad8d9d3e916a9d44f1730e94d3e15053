The fires claimed seven lives and have left thousands of people displaced. CAPE TOWN - Authorities say it's too early to say just how much damage was caused by runaway fires on the Garden Route. The fires claimed seven lives and have left thousands of people displaced. The blaze in the Eden District has now been contained, but fire teams are still working to damp down potential hotspots. The Department of Local Government’s James Brent Styan says expert teams will assess the extent of the damage caused. “It’s quite an in-depth assessment by experts, a variety of experts, it needs to be done. I think it’s safe to say that although the damages run into the multiple billions, we hope to have a better grasp of things once all the experts have had a proper look.” (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
