LONDON - British Prime Minister Theresa May's top two aides quit on Saturday after her Conservative Party failed to win a majority in a national election.Nick Timothy, May's co-chief of staff, said on the Conservative Home website that he stepped down on Friday, while the BBC reported that Fiona Hill had also quit.&quot;The reason for the disappointing result was not the absence of support for Theresa May and the Conservatives but an unexpected surge in support for Labour,&quot; Timothy wrote.&quot;I take responsibility for my part in this election campaign, which was the oversight of our policy programme. In particular, I regret the decision not to include in the manifesto a ceiling as well as a floor in our proposal to help meet the increasing cost of social care,&quot; he added.
