Heino Kuhn has shown outstanding form for South Africa A on their recent tour of England which included a double century in the four-day match against Hampshire and a further century against the England Lions. He certainly deserved his place on a consistent form which also includes back-to-back Sunfoil Series seasons. commented CSA Selection Convener, Linda Zondi.Zondi also commented on Phehlukwayo s inclusion. Andile s selection is a continuation of our drive to develop bowling all-rounders for the Test team. He and Chris Morris will fill this role in support of Vernon Philander. At the age of 21, he is certainly one for the future. The First Test begins on 6 July at Lords.Proteas Test squad: Faf du Plessis (capt), Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Theunis de Bruyn, Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, Dean Elgar, Heino Kuhn, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Duanne Olivier, Andile Phehlukwayo, Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
