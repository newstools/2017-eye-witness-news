The High Court in Pretoria last week gave the Health Department just two days to pay the San Michelle home more than R2 million. JOHANNESBURG - A psychiatric home in Pretoria says Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa must be arrested if its subsidies are not paid by midday on Wednesday.The High Court in Pretoria last week gave the Health Department just two days to pay the San Michelle home more than R2 million.After it failed to subsidise the facility for four consecutive months, the charity organisation says it's prepared to return to court.Martin Welz from the San Michelle Psychiatric Home says the department's failure to pay the subsidies is putting its 204 patients at risk. And they re all in dire stress and threatening to close and putting their patients on the streets. Very much like the Life Esidimeni case Welz says since the San Michelle home approached the High Court, several other psychiatric homes have complained about the same issue. In the meantime, 10 more homes have come to the same law firm asking, basically, for the same. Psychiatric facilities have come into sharp focus since last year when more than 100 mentally ill patients died after the department moved them to NGOs which were later found to have been operating unlawfully.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
