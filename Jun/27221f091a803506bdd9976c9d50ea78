CAPE TOWN - The National Assembly has embarked on a marathon sitting to deal with the Appropriation Bill, which provides for the allocation of revenue to state departments and entities.It s the next step in the process of passing the budget tabled by former finance minister Pravin Gordhan in February this year before his axing by President Jacob Zuma at the end of March and South Africa s downgrade to junk status.The debate takes place after the economy on Tuesday was declared to have entered a recession for the second time in less than 10 years.State capture, the revelations in the leaked Gupta emails and the limping economy emerged as strong themes in the debate.The Economic Freedom Fighters Natasha Louw says their party won t be supporting the Appropriation Bill. As long as we have a captured president, a captured government and captured state entities, to approve the Appropriation Bill is signing a blank cheque straight to the Gupta house.&quot;Opposition Members of Parliament have also highlighted rising government debt, wasteful expenditure and financial and governance instability in state-owned entities.Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says the country can t afford to grow despondent and that a united effort is needed to lift the economy out of its low-growth path.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
