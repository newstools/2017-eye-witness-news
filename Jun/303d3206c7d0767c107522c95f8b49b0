The Companies Tribunal has reserved its decision, saying it will communicate its ruling electronically to the parties once a decision has been made. JOHANNESBURG The Companies Tribunal has heard that South African Airways (SAA) chairperson Dudu Myeni lied twice about a multi-billion rand Airbus deal but she maintains this was a mistake.Myeni was served with a compliance notice by the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission following claims she had misrepresented a board decision to former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba.Myeni told the minister that the board had decided to lease two new planes when in fact it had agreed to lease ten.The Companies Tribunal has reserved its decision, saying it will communicate its ruling electronically to the parties once a decision has been made.Myeni s legal team has argued that she did not intentionally mislead the then Public Enterprises Minister about the number of new planes that were to be leased.But the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission says Myeni avoided explaining herself, seemingly even to her own lawyers about why she lied to the minister twice in writing.Myeni s lawyers say the compliance notice was issued unlawfully and should be declared invalid.The tribunal will rule on the matter, including whether it was jurisdiction to do so, in due course.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
