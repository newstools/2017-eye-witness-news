The choppers were brought in for the first time on Thursday after the extreme wind eased.Many displaced community members were still making their way to the Chris Nissen Primary School. The modest rural school has been activated as a relief centre to scores of displaced residents forced to flee their homes. Venue coordinator, Lennox Rulumente says they've received several donations from NGOs as well as private residents. People still keep coming because their houses have burned to ashes.
