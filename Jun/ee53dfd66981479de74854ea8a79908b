Eyewitness News asked you if it was time to drop English and use isiZulu as SA&#8217;s official language? CAPE TOWN - Former president Nelson Mandela once said: If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. But If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart. Language isn t simply the way we communicate with one another, it s an expression of our heritage and cultural identity.South Africa is a culturally diverse nation with 11 official languages.Through the period of apartheid, South Africa had two official languages: English and Afrikaans. However, that changed when the government of Nelson Mandela came into power in 1994. Nine more indigenous languages were recognised under the Constitution.The country s Constitution provides for 11 official languages: Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu, Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, siSwati, Tshivenda and Xitsonga.Today, South Africans live in households where more than one African language is spoken. Many schools around the country have English and Afrikaans as compulsory languages and at least one African language as an optional language.According to the 2011 census, isiZulu is the home or first language of 22.7% of the population, followed by isiXhosa at 16%, Afrikaans at 13.5%, and English at 9.6%.Times Live columnist Andile Ndlovu wrote a piece in which he suggested that it may be time to consider dropping English as South Africa s official language and instead begin using isiZulu, the most widely spoken language in South Africa.EWN political journalist and host of the Midday Report Stephen Grootes discussed Ndlovu s suggestion with Dr Somadoda Fikeni, a political analyst based at The University of South Africa. If the Constitution speaks to diversity, then it is almost inconceivable that other cultural groups would accept one language to be used as a national language because that would be a cultural imposition on others, Fikeni said.Eyewitness News asked if it s time to drop English and use isiZulu as SA s official language?On Twitter 2,895 people voted:Is it time to drop English and use IsiZulu as SA s official language? https://t.co/tArDaSWHgAThe majority of those who voted expressed their concerned over how the country will conduct business.
