CAPE TOWN - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) says safety concerns around Metrorail trains are being addressed, but a whole-society approach is needed to tackle crime.It has also indicated that it's worried about the safety of commuters and employees, &quot;who are under siege by criminals&quot;.Prasa, along with Joe Maswanganyi, have been cited as respondents in a Western Cape High Court application by the United National Transport Union, who are for the establishment of an armed response unit.The court application is in response to a series of attacks several Metrorail trains over the last year. There were also two other incidents last week where trains were gutted by fire.The trade union's general secretary Steve Harris explains: I don t think the newly appointed minister has taken the time to look at what s happening in Cape Town, especially within in Prasa. We perturbed. Prasa nor the minister's spokesperson have seen the court papers and have indicated they will respond properly later this week.Harris says they've been in talks with Prasa about safety for months now. We made proposals to the court. We said they need a reaction unit and we told them the SAPS needs to be included in the process. The reaction unit should consist of a group of 10-15 people. They should get to a scene within 5-10 minutes. WATCH: 8 train carriages destroyed in chaos at Cape Town Train Station(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
