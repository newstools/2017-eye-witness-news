TOKYO Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to accelerate plans to amend Japan s pacifist constitution, saying he expects to submit a proposed revision to lawmakers before the end of the year, media reported on Sunday.Abe said in a speech in Kobe city on Saturday he planned to submit a proposal for the first-ever amendment of Japan s post-World War Two constitution during an extraordinary session of parliament that will be convened later this year, Japan s main daily newspapers reported.Abe has proposed amending the constitution s war-renouncing Article 9 by 2020 to officially recognise Japan s Self-Defense Forces as its military.Such a change could draw fire from China and South Korea, where bitter memories of Japan s past military aggression persist. They would likely see the change as a step toward the re-emergence of Japan as a military power.Abe had been expected to wait until next year before seeking legislators approval of the change. He would need to win the support of two-thirds of members of both houses of parliament and a majority of votes in a referendum.Supporters of Japan s post-war pacifism view Article 9 as the foundation of its democracy. Many conservatives see it as a humiliation imposed by the United States after Japan s defeat in 1945.
