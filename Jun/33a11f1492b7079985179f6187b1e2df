JOHANNESBURG - The Fees Commission says it s on track to conclude its report which will be sent to President Jacob Zuma at the end of this month.Last year, Zuma extended the commission s deadline to 30 June to allow more time for research and consultation.The commission says it ll meet the deadline.However, the South African Students Congress says it s been reliably informed that the commission is seeking another postponement.The congress s Lwando Majiza said: And certainly if by that semester the commission doesn t release the report, we might instruct our students to stay away until the report is out.
