Bafana are in action against Zambia in Rustenburg on Tuesday night, looking to pick up their second win under Stuart Baxter. JOHANNESBURG - Stuart Baxter says South Africans need to show a little more patriotism and rally behind Bafana Bafana unconditionally.Bafana are in action against Zambia in Rustenburg on Tuesday night, looking to pick up their second win under Baxter.He says the country must give the team a break. Before we ve even kicked the ball, there s critics. That s something that I think you guys should be almost ashamed of that there are critics of our national team, before we ve kicked a ball. I ve had three sessions and now we play against a team, away from home who we ve never beaten, who ve had three weeks in camp and there are critics before we ve kicked the ball. Baxter says his boys were remarkable against Nigeria. Maybe we have silenced some critics but those critics should be ashamed of themselves because that s not the way to support the players in the national team. Me, I m a professional, the win personally is 5 to 10% up or down. We like to think, coaches, that we such impact but these guys did a tremendous job. He says the boys responded well to his game plan. I gave them a few ideas, they took it, ran with it and showed me that we can have a future, we can have a real future. So, for me personally, it means a little win. But for my ego, I don t think I ve done that much work. I think the players did a tremendous job. He says the win over Nigeria doesn't suddenly mean Bafana is on the rise. We haven t turned any corners, that s the truth. It s a process and I don t think we ve turned any corners. I think what I would like to happen is this is a catalyst. A catalyst of people understanding that we are trying to develop something.
