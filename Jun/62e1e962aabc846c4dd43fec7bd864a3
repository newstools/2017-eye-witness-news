We're enjoying winning them, so we'll continue to do so,&quot; Bale added.&quot;Three Champions Leagues in four seasons isn't too bad.&quot;I think we can get better. We are still quite young as a whole team and we have a great squad.&quot;Saturday's victory was made sweeter for Bale as he became just the sixth player to win a European final in his hometown as well as the only Welshman to win the continent's top trophy three times, surpassing Ryan Giggs and Joey Jones.&quot;To play a final in your home city is incredible but to win it is even better, a great experience,&quot; Bale said.
