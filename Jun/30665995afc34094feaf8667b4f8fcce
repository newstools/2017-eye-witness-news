The ANC&#8217;s Zizi Kodwa says if it is found MPs and government ministers did break the law, heads must roll. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has given its first formal response to the Gupta emails - saying it's gravely concerned about them - and that government must urgently try to find out if the messages that have been published so far are a true reflection of what's been happening.The party also says that these matters cannot be left to fester.The documents released this week by the Daily Maverick and AmaBhungane show conversations between the Gupta family and their employees, about how government officials would make certain decisions and appointments. The ANC says as a result of the publication of these emails, it reiterates its decision that there should be a Judicial Commission of Enquiry into claims of state capture. The party s Zizi Kodwa says these claims are incredibly serious. That s why we must, therefore, unleash our law enforcement, unleash our government. Our government must act to protect its own integrity and credibility. He also says if it is found members of parliament and government ministers did break the law, heads must roll. The ANC says the alleged actions by some government officials and ministers that are spelt out in the Gupta emails are despicable. Kodwa says the kind of behaviour spelt out in the Gupta emails is simply unacceptable. There are certain things that are frowned upon and which are despicable in the emails. Allegations that certain ministers shared sensitive Cabinet information with private citizens for private interest. And he says the government must investigate these claims. At the heart of them is the integrity and the credibility of a democratic state that is influenced by certain individuals and some people acting in a manner that undermined its integrity.
