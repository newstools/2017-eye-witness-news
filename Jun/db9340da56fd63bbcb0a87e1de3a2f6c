Municipalities across the country collectively owe Eskom R9.6 billion but they, in turn, are owed R116 billion by debtors. CAPE TOWN – The South African Local Government Association (Salga) wants Eskom to write off billions of rand debt owed by municipalities. This is one of the matters discussed at Salga’s Council of Mayors currently taking placing in Cape Town. Some of the municipalities have been threatened with power cuts, and a few months ago National Treasury withheld equitable share funds due to their failure to pay the power utility. Municipalities across the country collectively owe Eskom R9.6 billion but they, in turn, are owed R116 billion by debtors, including government departments. SALGA has warned if the current impasse is not resolved - it could lead to a collapse of many municipalities that are already financially unsustainable. The association's president Parks Tau says it is also looking at alternative funding solutions for struggling municipalities. “If we don’t take this approach, we place at risk the ability of local government to provide services to municipalities in a sustainable manner.” SALGA wants municipalities to be able to develop their own energy-generation projects and to buy from local sources.
