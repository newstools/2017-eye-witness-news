The Home Affairs portfolio committee has agreed to give the Home Affairs Department a week to answer questions about the citizenship matter. PARLIAMENT - Former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba s decision to grant members of the Gupta family citizenship has exposed divisions in the African National Congress (ANC) s approach in Parliament to deal with the controversy around alleged state capture.The Home Affairs portfolio committee has agreed to give the department a week to answer questions about the citizenship matter following a stalled attempt to discuss the issue on Tuesday.Last week, the Economic Freedom Fighters leaked letters showing how Gigaba may have waived a legal requirement to grant the family citizenship by naturalisation despite a department official turning down the application.ANC MP Maesela Kekana, a South African Communist Party (SACP) member from Gauteng, was vocal during Tuesday s meeting about the need to summon Gigaba to explain his actions. We need to investigate the issue of naturalisation. Of course, that issue implicates Gigaba and we ve agreed that we must take this issue head-on but I was surprised that others started saying something different. Parliamentarians also want to see copies of official documents related to Gigaba s decision including the motivation that members of the Gupta family had apparently sent him.The issue is expected to be back on the portfolio committee s agenda next Tuesday, 27 June.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
