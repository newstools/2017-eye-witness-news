The flyhalf slotted four penalties as Lions produced a performance of test-match intensity to beat the Crusaders in the third game of their tour of New Zealand. WELLINGTON - Flyhalf Owen Farrell slotted four penalties as the British and Irish Lions produced a performance of test-match intensity to beat the Canterbury Crusaders 12-3 in the third game of their tour of New Zealand on Saturday.Richie Mo unga kicked a first half penalty for the only points for the Crusaders, who have claimed seven Super Rugby titles and won all 14 of their games in the competition this season.Warren Gatland s Lions had been under immense pressure after a mediocre start to their 10-match tour, with an unconvincing 13-7 victory over the Provincial Barbarians and a 22-16 loss to the Auckland Blues on Wednesday.But a victory born of a huge defensive effort and the almost unerring boot of Farrell will give them a major boost as they head to Dunedin to face the Otago Highlanders on Tuesday.
