Many business owners in Reiger Park had to close shop on Tuesday after some of their stores were looted by an angry crowd. Salon owner Solly Shivambu says the power cuts means they re losing out on business. If we don t have electricity, that means we can t survive. We can t do our job because we mostly use it in our line of work. He says the area has a huge problem when it comes to electricity. It always does this, it is not a surprise to us because it always happens like this. But some residents who insist their connections are legal, say they were never notified about the Red Ants plans.#ReigerPark Salon owner Solly Shivambu's business was affected by the electricity cuts by the Red Ants.
