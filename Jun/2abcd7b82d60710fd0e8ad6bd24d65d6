This has not been an easy decision and I think the alternative would be for us as a party to be embroiled in a protracted legal battle in the lead up towards the 2019 election. I have no doubt that this, in fact, would have caused further damage into the organisation. #Zille Maimane says Zille runs a good government in the Western Cape. CMZille has previously apologised unreservedly for her tweets but continued to defend them.She has issued another apology, she says this time it's genuine. I realise the wounds of history that my tweet, and subsequent defence of it, has opened. In particular, I recognise that my actions were insensitive to South Africans who suffered under colonial oppression. Zille will continue to serve as Western Cape premier and will be allowed to attend DA caucus meetings.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
