JOHANNESBURG - The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says Austrian-owned e-toll collection company ETC has been paid 74% of all income received from motorists since the system's inception in 2013.Last week Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi told Parliament that the company has collected R2.9 billion from e-tolling.Outa says at an average of R55 million per month paid to the foreign firm and with the current e-toll income levels sitting at around R63 million per month, virtually no money is going toward e-toll bonds.
