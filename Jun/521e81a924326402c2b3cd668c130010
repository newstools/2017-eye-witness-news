JOHANNESBURG - The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation says it took a great deal of bravery and conviction from anti-apartheid lawyer Joel Joffe to defend activists. Joffe defended former president Nelson Mandela during the Rivonia Trial and died at his home in England this week. He was 85. The foundation s Zaakirah Vadi says: And it came at a time when Mandela, Kathrada, Sisulu and others were regarded as terrorists by the state. And we think Joffe together with people like Arthur Chaskalson, George Bizos, Bram Fischer and others made an immense contribution. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
