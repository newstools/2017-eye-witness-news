Reports say the sailors were trapped inside the ship, which then took on water. JOHANNESBURG - US investigators are now trying to determine why a warship collided with a merchant vessel, killing seven sailors off the coast of Japan. The USS Fitzgerald hit a container ship on Saturday. Reports say the sailors were trapped inside the ship, which then took on water. Rescue workers found the bodies after gaining access to damaged parts of the vessel. Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, which charters the container ship, ASX Crystal, said in a statement on Saturday it would "cooperate fully" with the Coast Guard's investigation of the incident. At around 29,000 tons displacement, the ship dwarfs the 8,315-ton US warship. It was carrying 1,080 containers from the port of Nagoya to Tokyo. None of the 20 crew members aboard the container ship, all Filipino, were injured, and the ship was not leaking oil, Nippon Yusen said. The ship arrived at Tokyo Bay later on Saturday. The waterways approaching Tokyo Bay are busy with commercial vessels sailing to and from Japanâ€™s two biggest container ports in Tokyo and Yokohama.  Additional reporting by Reuters.
