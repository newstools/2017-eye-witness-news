The 'Carte Blanche' producer and his friend Werner Perchtold were shot dead at the Zebra Inn restaurant in the Maboneng Precinct. JOHANNESBURG - Three people have been arrested in connection with the murder of Carte Blanche producer Johann Botha and his friend Werner Perchtold. The two were shot dead at the Zebra Inn restaurant in the Maboneng Precinct last week. The police’s Richard Munyai says: “It’s a very sensitive stage. We’re investigating a case of murder and looking at the CCTV. We’re hoping that we can make a breakthrough very soon as our investigation is still underway.” Earlier this week, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula urged the police to do everything in their power to find the suspects responsible for the murders. Police ministry spokesperson Vuyo Mhaga said that Botha died while trying to plead with the armed men not to kill Perchtold. “This is similar to the incident of Mandla Hlatshwayo; where good Samaritans are trying to assist and these criminals do as they pleased. They kill people who are of great importance to South Africans.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
