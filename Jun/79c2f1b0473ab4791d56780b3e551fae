Avian veterinarian Deon de Beer says that the virus can affect the economy if nothing is done to stop its spread. JOHANNESBURG Agriculture Minister Senzeni Zokwana is on Thursday expected to discuss the recent outbreak of avian flu in the country.Three farms have so far been affected by the virus leading to the culling of thousands of chickens and other birds.Avian veterinarian Deon de Beer says that the virus can affect the economy if nothing is done to stop its spread. All these chicken farms are going to be closed. There are so many jobs that are going to be lost, it s going to have a tremendous impact on the South African economy. De Beer says he knew last year that birds were becoming more susceptible to serious viruses such as this one. What happened is that our population was extremely susceptible for any challenge from any pathogen that would have come into South Africa. It s understood that humans aren't able to catch the H5N8 strain of bird flu if it remains in its current biological form.
