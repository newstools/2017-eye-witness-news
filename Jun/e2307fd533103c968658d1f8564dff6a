Transnet have assured the NSPCA that any method used to control or eradicate their feral cat problem will be executed in accordance with the law. JOHANNESBURG Transnet has come out to refute claims that they have allegedly proposed the poisoning of cats as a method of eradicating the felines in and around various premises owned by the company.Failed attempts by the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) to meet with Transnet resulted in the release of a media statement to this effect, but further investigations and eventual correspondence from Transnet confirmed that the allegations of cat poisoning were both unsubstantiated and false.In a media statement released on Tuesday, Transnet says it has assured the NSPCA that any method used to control or eradicate their feral cat problem will be executed in accordance with the Animals Protection Act No 71 of 1962.
