The well-known artist was sentenced to 18 years behind bars for the murder of sex worker Nokuphila Kumalo. CAPE TOWN - Well-known artist Zwelethu Mthethwa is planning to appeal his murder conviction. Mthethwa was sentenced to 18 years behind bars in the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday for the murder of sex worker Nokuphila Kumalo in Woodstock four years ago.In handing down the sentence, Judge Patricia Goliath said the court had to send a clear message that gender-based violence would not be tolerated. Mthethwa s lawyer William Booth says he s received instructions to file an application for leave to appeal. Not only in respect of the conviction, which was handed down some months ago, but as well as with regards to the severity of the sentence. We feel that the sentence in particularly was very heavy.
