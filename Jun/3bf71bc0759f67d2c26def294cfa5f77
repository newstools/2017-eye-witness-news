Baroka FC ensured they will remain in the PSL next season after they drew 1-1 with Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday.The draw was enough for Baroka to remain in the top flight, after they finished 3 points clear of Lidoda Duvha, who needed at least a victory by two goals if they wanted to leapfrog them into the top spot of the standings.Leopards started the match with clear intentions and looked the better side in the opening passage of play, with Baroka forced into some desperate defence at times.Bakgaga got into the pace of the game steadily though, and by 34 minutes the inevitable first goal came through Victor Letsoalo, after a frantic few moments in the Leopards box.Baroka looked the better of the two sides throughout the remainder of the first half, with Leopards only barely managing to keep the score line at 1-0 at times.In the second half Letsoalo gave Leopards a glimmer of hope when a late challenge on Jean Munganga earned him a second yellow card, and reduced Baroka to 10 men for the majority of the second period.With the pressure of playing a man down mounting, Black Leopards managed to find a breakthrough through a penalty from Leonard Ntshangase.Leopards closed out the game by throwing everything but the kitchen sink at the Baroka goal, but unfortunately for Lidoda Duvha just couldn t break down Baroka who were the deserved winners at the end of an almost flawless promotion/relegation campaign.
