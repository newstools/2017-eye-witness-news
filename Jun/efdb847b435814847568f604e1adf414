British High Commissioner to South Africa Nigel Casey says SA and the UK have a two-way street relationship in terms of investment. JOHANNESBURG - The British High Commissioner to South Africa Nigel Casey says London s relationship with Pretoria is a long term one that will endure through good and bad, even if SA is downgraded again.Credit rating firm S&amp;P Global warned on Tuesday that South Africa's rating could be cut deeper into junk territory if government meddles with the &quot;critical&quot; independence of the Reserve Bank.It follows Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's call for the bank to focus on growth more than maintaining currency and price stability.S&amp;P stripped SA of the coveted investment grade rating in April after the sacking of then finance minister Pravin Gordhan.Casey said, The standard feature of the South Africa-UK relationship is a long term one. We re deeply invested in this country and its future, over a third of foreign investment in this country still comes from the UK and South African companies have invested more in the UK, so it s a two-way relationship.
