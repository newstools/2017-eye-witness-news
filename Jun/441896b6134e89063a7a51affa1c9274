The government believes will empower communities to collectively eliminate the scourge of sexual violence and abuse. CAPE TOWN - A government probe has found one in three children is likely to be sexually abused.That's a key finding of an inter-ministerial committee on violence against women and children.Departments are following up on the work of the committee with an Imbizo in Khayelitsha on Thursday.The Western Cape principal family advocate Sha Ebrahim says government has put measures in place to tackle the surge of violence against women and children. It s a 360 degrees type of a thing; communities have to be part of it and children have to be made aware of what the risks are relating to their bodies. She has also called on the elderly to get involved. Very often when parents go to work, in many cases people are not capable of taking care of children and these are the actual soldiers who raise our children for us. Representatives from Khayelitsha, Elsies River and Mitchells Plain have attended the Imbizo, which government believes will empower communities to collectively eliminate the scourge of sexual violence and abuse.&quot;At the same time, South Africa cannot be called a civilised society until we address the abuse against children.&quot;That's the comment from a senior legal services officer at the Human Rights Commission, Tammy Carter.Carter says while there is no easy solution to the problem, the country needs to address it holistically. In the Western Cape, 21 children have died since the start of this year. That is 21 too many. You can t even begin to, as a society, consider yourself relatively civilised if this is how we are treating our children.
