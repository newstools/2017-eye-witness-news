MPs paid tribute to Ahmed Kathrada, who died in March. Veronica Mente quoted from a statement from the Kathrada Foundation, urging MPs to support a motion of no confidence in Jacob Zuma. CAPE TOWN The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says African National Congress (ANC) Members of Parliament (MPs) should honour the memory of fallen freedom fighter Ahmed Kathrada by supporting the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma when it comes before the House.MPs are paying tribute to Kathrada, who died in March this year.EFF MP Veronica Mente read from a statement issued on Monday by the Kathrada Foundation, which urged MPs wanting to honour the late struggle stalwart to support the no confidence motion. When the motion of no confidence in the president comes up in the near future, what will you do to really honour, and not grandstand, Kathrada? You must honour Kathrada and vote against the president of the corrupt ANC, Zuma. Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor hailed Kathrada as an outstanding ANC cadre. He would be first to chastise us for trying to make him a saint. He didn t suffer fools or pomposity kindly. He had a wicked sense of humour and could be sharp and poignant in expressing displeasure. The Democratic Alliance s Ghaleb Cachalia, the son of late ANC stalwarts Amina and Yusuf Cachalia, read from the letter Kathrada wrote to President Zuma last March in which he asked him to step down. His values would never have allowed him to be the handmaiden of Nkandla, the Zuptas and the misreading of history and the attempted sale of our nation. The Kathrada Foundation says due to late notice and it being the month of Ramadan, family members could not attend Tuesday's sitting, while Kathrada's life partner, Barbara Hogan, had another family bereavement.
