PRETORIA - Eyewitness News has learnt that a member of the so-called Gupta Paid Twitter knew of a surveillance report of former Business Day editor Peter Bruce at least four months ago.The website White Monopoly Capital Leaks uploaded a report on Monday which showed Bruce, his wife and friends had been spied on for almost a week last year.The website, as its name suggests, is a direct response to reports based on the Gupta email leaks.It is part of a wider campaign which has targeted numerous editors and journalists who have been critical of the controversial family and exposed their links to politicians.One of the most vicious of the paid Twitter trolls tweeted Bruce in February and interestingly included Atul Gupta in the post, where he asked Bruce about cheating on his wife before saying he will expose him. Four months later, the white monopoly capital website reveals a report which includes surveillance pictures of Bruce and claims that he is cheating on his wife.Two independent sources, who have studied the document, say that it is the work of either Crime Intelligence or the State Security Agency.Bruce says the intention is clear. Whoever was doing the surveillance, it could have been national intelligence (or) it could have been a private investigator hired by the (Gupta) family. Whatever it was, it was there to intimidate and stop me doing my job properly. A link to the report was removed from the website on Tuesday after EWN sent questions to the Guptas and the Twitter account in questions. Neither of the parties responded.
