Some parents have been demanding funding from government for a feeding scheme for learners at the Lingomso Primary School. CAPE TOWN - Officials from the Western Cape Education Department are trying to restore normality at a Tulbagh school where parents have been protesting. Some parents have been demanding funding from government for a feeding scheme for learners at the Lingomso Primary School. The newly built school, which opened in January, has been classified as a quintile 5 school which means it does not receive funding from national government to provide meals for learners. Many of the pupils at the new school, however, previously attended quintile 1 to 3 schools where they received at least two meals a day. Education MEC spokesperson Jessica Shelver said: “In terms of the policy, provinces may not extend the feeding scheme to schools in quintile 5, which new Lingomso Primary School has been classified as. Meanwhile, the MEC is desperately trying to find alternatives. And our district officials are working hard, with the school, to allow schooling to continue as normal while seeking to finalise the solution.”
