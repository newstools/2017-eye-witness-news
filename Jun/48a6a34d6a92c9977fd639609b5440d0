I just cannot see for myself what the reason is, except that people are just very greedy and they want to become millionaires overnight. The Cancer Alliance s Salome Meyer says they hope the commission will get to the bottom of the claims around excessive pricing. We hope that the Competition Commission reviews everything. Meanwhile, the commission says it hopes to wrap up its investigation soon as many people are in need of the life-saving medication.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
