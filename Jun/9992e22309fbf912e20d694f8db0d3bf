I m just going to give it my best on Sunday. That is all I can do. I ve been training very hard from January until before Comrades on Sunday. She says she can't concern herself about her competitors. I m not trying to focus on any other athlete. I am just trying to focus on my own race on Sunday.

In the end, I came second.&quot;(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
