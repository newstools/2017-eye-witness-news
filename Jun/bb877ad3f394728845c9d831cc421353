The blackout is currently underway with organisers calling on people to refrain from using social networks for 24 hours in a bid to raise awareness about exorbitant costs of data. JOHANNESBURG - While South Africans have been urged to take part in the social media boycott on Wednesday, experts say the campaign may not do much to address the country's data cost divide.The blackout is currently underway with organisers calling on people to refrain from using social networks for 24 hours in a bid to raise awareness around the exorbitant cost of data.South Africa reportedly has the second highest data costs globally coming second only to Brazil.Tech expert from Worldwide Worx, Arthur Goldstuck, says the intention of the campaign seems to be limited. The problem with trying to punish the operators for high data costs is that the people who are most affected by that are using the least data and are the least active on social media. The people who are able to buy data bundles upfront or who are on contract are not that affected by high data prices. At the same time, social media expert Jodene Shaer says a complete shutdown is not realistic. And because there is such a reliance on it, for personal reasons, for business reasons, even for emotional reasons, I think it s really difficult to get a complete shutdown. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
