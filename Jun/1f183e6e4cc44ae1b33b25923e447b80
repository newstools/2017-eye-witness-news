The state has also said the fact that Ngwenya&#8217;s two other suspected accomplices haven&#8217;t been arrested may jeopardise the case. JOHANNESBURG The man accused of killing Thembisile Yende will appear in the Springs magistrates court on Thursday morning for a decision on his bail application.David Ngwenya, who was Yende s colleague, is being charged with premeditated murder.It emerged in court this week that he was allegedly part of a copper syndicate she knew about and was due to blow the whistle on them.Ngwenya s defence has submitted that there s no legitimate reason to keep him behind bars as he s not a flight risk, doesn t pose any threat to witnesses and has no previous or pending convictions against him.However, the State has argued that due to his relations with some Eskom employees, he could intimidate or influence potential witnesses.The State has also said the fact that Ngwenya s two other suspected accomplices haven t been arrested may jeopardise the case.The defence has dismissed this, saying that Ngwenya should be treated as innocent until proven guilty.
