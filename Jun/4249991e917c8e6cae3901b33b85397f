Two constables were found shot dead at a SAPS in Koffiefontein. Another was shot and wounded at Lingelethu West police station in Khayelitsha. CAPE TOWN - The police's top managers have been advised to purchase CCTV cameras and body cameras for all the country's police stations to improve security.Two constables were found shot dead at a South African Police Station community service centre in Koffiefontein, in the Free State on Thursday morning.Another was shot and wounded during an attack on the Lingelethu West police station in Khayelitsha on Wednesday.The oversight committee's chairperson, Francois Beukman, says parliamentarians have already made recommendations on how the SAPS can improve the safety of police officers on duty.He says fresh measures should be implemented as a matter of urgency.Beukman believes some of service's R87 billion budget should be spent on CCTV cameras at police stations and on body cameras for officers. That is a huge budget and we believe there is space within the visible policing budget to make these technologies available. SAPS management will be asked to brief the committee on an implementation plan by the end of next month.(Edited by Zinhle)
