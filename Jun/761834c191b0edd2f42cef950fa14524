Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says the negative attitude of some health workers in state institutions is a well-known problem. PARLIAMENT - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has instructed the head of the Tshwane District Hospital to take action against a nurse who was rude to a Congolese woman who wanted to give birth at the hospital.Francine Kalala wound up giving birth at Johannesburg's Park Station.Motsoaledi on Wednesday told Parliament s Health Committee that state hospitals never turn away foreign nationals nor undocumented migrants.Motsoaledi says the negative attitude of some health workers in state institutions is a well-known problem.He says he personally watched seven hours of CCTV footage to determine whether it was true that Kalala was turned away from the Charlotte Maxeke and Steve Biko hospitals as had been reported. But she had not gone to either facilities before giving birth.Motsoaledi says this was not a case of refusing to treat a foreign national but rather a case of negative staff behaviour. This is one situation that must not be tolerated. The issue of attitude, that s the one we re dealing with. That s my conclusion. Motsoaledi says the Health Ombudsman's office had been established precisely for the purpose of protecting the public from poor treatment at state facilities.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
