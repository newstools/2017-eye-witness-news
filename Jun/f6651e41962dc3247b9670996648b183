When the troops reach this point, they will have isolated the remaining IS fighters in four separate pockets. The aim is to open ways for civilians to evacuate. We give them indications by lousdspeaker when it s possible, an Iraqi military spokesman told Reuters by phone.Some 7,000 civilians were brought out of the Old City this week, the Iraqi state news website said. Several street intersections were seized during the day.Reuters journalists in Mosul saw people reaching safety. Some were injured and some had been carried on army humvees to rear positions where they were given bananas, biscuits and water.

Hundreds of civilians fleeing the Old City have been killed in the past three weeks.RUBBLE OF THE HUNCHBACK The Iraqi government once hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but the bloody campaign has dragged on as the militants reinforced positions in civilian areas, launched suicide car and motorbike bombs, laid booby traps and kept up barrages of sniper and mortar fire.The military said it had defused dozens of booby traps as troops advanced on Friday.The area still under IS control is about 2 square kilometres in extent, alongside the western bank of the Tigris, which bisects Mosul.The fall of Mosul would mark the end of the Iraqi half of the militants caliphate as a state structure, but Islamic State would remain in control of large areas of both Iraq and Syria.Islamic State posted a video online showing the remaining square base of the mosque s leaning minaret amid a mountain of rubble, with wrecked cars nearby.The destruction caused anger and grief for Mosul s people, who affectionately call the tower al-Hadba, or the hunchback .Islamic State s black flag had been flying on the 45-metre minaret since June 2014.

We don t have any concrete evidence on whether or not he s dead either, US Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the international coalition battling Islamic State, told a Pentagon briefing.In Syria, the insurgents capital , Raqqa, is nearly encircled by a US-backed Kurdish-led coalition. We certainly know that if he is still alive, we expect that he is not being able to influence what is currently happening in Raqqa or Mosul or overall in the Isis (Islamic State) as they continue to lose their physical caliphate, Dillon said.US intelligence officials say Islamic State has moved most of its leaders, along with its online propaganda operation and its limited command and control of attacks in Europe and elsewhere, to Al Mayadin in eastern Syria s Deir al Zour province.
