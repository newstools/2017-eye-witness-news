Hopefully, I've got enough time.&quot;Farah's back-to-back Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m gold medals and five world titles make him one of the greatest distance runners of all time.The 34-year-old, who is scheduled to appear at Diamond League meetings in London and Monaco next month, will be turning his attention on running marathon events after the championships.
