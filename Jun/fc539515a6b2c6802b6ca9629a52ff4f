Sexwale says its unfair that the Guptas can have this kind of unfiltered influence in South Africa's government when no one from here has this kind of power over their government in India. JOHANNESBURG - Businessman and former political prisoner Tokyo Sexwale says the kind of influence he believes the Gupta family has in South Africa is deeply worrisome.Sexwale says its unfair that the Guptas can have this kind of unfiltered influence in South Africa's government when no one from here has this kind of power over their government in India.Sexwale was speaking at the sidelines at the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Houghton on Wednesday.The former Cabinet minister says that as a board member of the foundation, he supports the urgent establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry to expose state capture in all its forms.Sexwale says that such a commission must be headed by a judge not chosen by President Jacob Zuma.&quot;That such a commission must be headed by a judge, and such a judge must be chosen by the Chief Justice and not the president because the president is conflicted, as far as I know.&quot;He says this commission is about uprooting an entire network of corruption.&quot;The entire thing has not been looked at, that's why it is not a one-detective action. A commission means that it's public.&quot;At the same time, the foundation says the president should heed the call of the people and step down.
