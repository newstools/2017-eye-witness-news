Treasury DG Dondo Mogajane says if SAA fails to meet its debt obligations, it will have a ripple effect on the government&#8217;s entire loan guarantee framework. PARLIAMENT - Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane says if South African Airways (SAA) fails to meet its debt obligations, it will have a ripple effect on the government s entire loan guarantee framework.Mogajane was addressing Parliament s Standing Committee on Finance during a meeting that saw a major clash between its chairperson Yunus Carrim and fellow African National Congress (ANC) Peace Mabe.Mabe wanted SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni to be allowed to update the committee on SAA s precarious financial situation, something her party colleagues were opposed to as Myeni was the only board member present.Mogajane says they re in talks with banks in a bid to roll over loans worth around R9 billion that the country s ailing national airline is due to repay by the end of this month. If we don t meet our obligations, that is going to have a ripple effect into the whole guarantee framework of the whole of government. So, we understand the importance and the urgency of not acting carefully and acting in a very responsible way as we approach the maturity of these loans coming on 30 June. Mogajane says he s expecting most lenders to agree to roll over the loans.The Democratic Alliance s Alf Lees, however, has told Eyewitness News that one major bank, which is owed around R2,3 billion, wants the loan to be repaid.Another SAA official told MPs it wasn t true that SAA was struggling to pay salaries.It was reported by Moneyweb last week that SAA had to rely on a vat refund and a loan to pay salaries at the end of May.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
