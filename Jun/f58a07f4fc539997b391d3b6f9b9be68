Residents say they entered into a verbal agreement with the landlord, in which he told them to use their rent money to fix damages caused by a fire in 2014. CAPE TOWN – The lawyer representing a Woodstock property owner has disputed claims by residents who are facing eviction. The residents were in court on Wednesday to fight an eviction order. The case has been postponed to the 13 July, while counsel awaits a report from the City of Cape Town regarding the availability of temporary accommodation for the affected families. Residents say they entered into a verbal agreement with the landlord, in which he told them to use their rent money to fix damages caused by a fire in 2014. The landlord's lawyer, Ahmed Ebrahim, has refuted these claims, saying the main reason for the eviction is because residents were not paying rent. “I am not aware of the verbal agreement and have no instruction with regards to that. Even though they are saying that that is the case, if you take a drive around the building, the side that was burned is still not fixed.”
