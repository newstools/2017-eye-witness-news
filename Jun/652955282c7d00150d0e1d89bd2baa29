JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Taxi Association (Santaco) has warned of national mass action on the 12th of July if their demands are not met.Gauteng taxi operators blocked highways on Thursday morning, leaving thousands of commuters stranded.Some drivers used their taxis to barricade highways and roads across the province.Santaco held a media briefing at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park on Thursday afternoon.Santaco's business arm Taxi Choice's Thulani Qwaba says not all their demands were met and says the taxi industry has had enough.He says the association is also in talks with 32 other companies, including government, to find ways to address their challenges.Qwaba says if they do not react quick enough, there will be a national strike. If they still want to diddle-daddle and mess about then, unfortunately, the taxi industry will go on to what will be much bigger than what you saw today. He says however, protest action has been suspended for now.Meanwhile, Santaco says failure by government to subsidise their business is killing the industry.The association says it does not understand why they are not subsidised as they are the biggest form of public transport in the country.Thousands of motorists were stranded around Gauteng early on Thursday morning when key routes were blocked. The taxis later moved to Emperors Palace in Kempton Park, where Santaco President Phillip Taaibosch shared with them the outcome of talks with several stakeholders, including SA Taxi Finance Holdings.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
