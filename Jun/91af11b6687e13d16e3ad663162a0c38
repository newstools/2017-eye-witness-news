JOHANNESBURG - The Proteas get their Champions Trophy campaign underway against Sri Lanka on Saturday.South Africa go into their opener off the back of a 2-1 ODI series loss to England.All-rounder JP Duminy says they've been preparing well for the tournament. We are pretty much ready for this tournament now and we ve had a good 10 days of preparation. This was not the ideal result in terms of the one-day series, but I think that s in the past now. Our full focus is on what s next. JP Duminy says some lessons were learned from the series against England. I think it was perfect in terms of preparation for the Champions Trophy, if you look at the timing of the series, to adapt to conditions for batting and bowling under these conditions. JP Duminy says the pitches in England differ. It s that time of the year where you get into the heart of summer. I think the wickets we played on, it was a wicket for bowlers.
