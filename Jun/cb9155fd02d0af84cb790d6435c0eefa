Home Affairs Director-General Mkuseli Apleni was expected to be accompanied by Hlengiwe Mkhize and Malusi Gigaba, but they were unable to attend. CAPE TOWN - Home Affairs Director General Mkuseli Apleni is answering lawmakers' questions about how members of the Gupta family were granted citizenship.Apleni was expected to be accompanied by Home Affairs Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, but they were unable to attend the meeting of the parliamentary oversight committee.Leaked documents showed that Gigaba, while he was heading Home Affairs, may have waived a physical residency requirement when deciding to grant the Guptas citizenship by naturalisation.Apleni says five members of the Gupta family applied, as a group, for South African citizenship in June 2013. It s a choice that I decide that I will apply for this naturalisation as a family or I can apply as an individual. He has explained that if one person does not comply with the legal requirements for naturalisation, the entire group is affected.Their application was denied, but the decision was overturned on review after further considerations. No minister sits in a corner there and just do this. Officials prepare documents to a minister and we recommend. A minister can either approve or disapprove. Opposition MPs have pointed out the minister erred by not tabling the decision in Parliament.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
