CAPE TOWN - Mathews Phosa has accepted nominations to run for the position of African National Congress (ANC) leader.He is attending an event where seven Cape Town branches have endorsed him in Khayelitsha on Sunday.Phosa says the people are calling for change. It s really humbling because it is people who are in love with the ANC, who cry for an alternative leadership and who believe the ANC deserve an alternative leadership both at political and economic levels. These are ordinary people and I m happy that it is them who make the choice about who must or mustn t be their leader. #ANC Phosa addressing the crowd.
