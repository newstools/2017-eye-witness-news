Journalist Johann Botha and Zebra Inn owner Werner Perchtold were shot and killed on Wednesday evening. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng police say they are now investigating cases of business robbery and murder after two people, including a Carte Blanche producer, were killed at a Johannesburg restaurant. On Wednesday evening four criminals stormed into the Zebra Inn in the Maboneng precinct, shooting the owner Werner Perchtold and journalist Johann Botha, before fleeing with an undisclosed amount of money. Police have urged anyone with information on the murders to come forward, but say at this stage they are not investigating anything other than cases of business robbery and murder. "We are calling upon anyone who might have information on the suspects to come forward so we can trace them," says the police's Kay Makhubele. Meanwhile, Carte Blanche executive producer George Mazarakis says he has no reason to believe that Bothaâ€™s death could have been linked to his work as a journalist. He says while Botha was working on a story about a land claim, it was in its very early stages. "In fact Johann was not working an expose per se. He had only begun the initial stages of an investigation into a potential story. It was not even a confirmed story and no material had been shot." No one has been arrested for the crime as yet and police say they will continue searching for the perpetrators.
