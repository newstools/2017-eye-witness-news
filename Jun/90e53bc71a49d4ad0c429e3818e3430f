The dossier contains Outa&#8217;s own research, the findings of the Public Protector and revelations contained in the Gupta leaks. CAPE TOWN Parliament has confirmed it s received a state capture dossier from Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) ahead of a proposed vote on a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.Outa has compiled a report that it regards as compelling evidence for Members of Parliament to remove Zuma from office.The dossier contains Outa s own research, the findings of the Public Protector and revelations contained in the Gupta leaks.Outa says the dossier shows that Zuma is a compromised president who allowed corrupt individuals to benefit from state coffers.The organisation is hoping that the report will be tabled for discussion by the National Assembly.But Parliament s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the issue of state capture is already on the legislature s agenda. The committees of Parliament are busy with the investigation into those matters. They re engaging with various departmental representatives. Four portfolio committees have been directed to investigate claims contained in the Gupta emails.Mothapo says that Speaker Baleka Mbete will apply her mind to Outa s report.Last week, the Constitutional Court ruled that Speaker Baleka Mbete was mistaken to think she doesn't have the power to allow a secret ballot in Parliament.Outa's Wayne Duvenage says: There is an interesting debate about what are the pros and cons of an open or a closed ballot either way, we believe the evidence we have given compels the members of Parliament to move in the right direction. &quot;We favour a secret ballot, but if it's no secret ballot, we don t believe it's the end.
