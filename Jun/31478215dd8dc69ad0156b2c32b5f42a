JOHANNESBURG - It's emerged in legal papers that Eskom will not oppose Brian Molefe's unfair dismissal case, saying that's a battle for Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown.Molefe's reappointment was rescinded after the minister and Eskom s board came under fire for the decision to return him to the post of CEO.The former chief executive was implicated in the State of Capture report over alleged dodgy dealings with the Gupta family and their mining company.The utility s board says it rescinded Molefe's appointment based on a directive from the minister and it won't be commenting on the subsequent labour challenge until it's concluded.Eskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma said: The matter is scheduled to be heard in court on 30 June, so I think we ll allow that process to happen in any event and I don t think it would be wise to actually speak [on it].
