The two organisations say they have agreed to do whatever they can, separately and jointly, to fight state capture. JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) say they ve held a two-day meeting and agreed to do whatever they can, separately and jointly, to fight state capture and help get the economy going.The two organisations say they both believe that state capture is hollowing out government s capacity to provide public services and that there is an attack on both the integrity and the functioning of state-owned entities.Cosatu and BLSA say their two-day meeting was unprecedented and was an attempt to understand their differences and sometimes contradictory perspectives on the different crises facing the country.The two organisations say they want a properly independent commission of inquiry into state capture and the entire Eskom board to be replaced.BLSA and Cosatu also say they ve agreed that properly independent professionals need to take over at the police service, the Hawks, the National Prosecuting Authority and South African Revenue Service and that these people need to work in the national interest.The organisations say they want a complete halt to the nuclear programme.Both Cosatu and BLSA have strongly criticised President Jacob Zuma since his reshuffle that saw Pravin Gordhan removed as finance minister.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
