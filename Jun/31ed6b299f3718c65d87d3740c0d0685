The ANC is not a coalition of factions, the ANC is one organisation. It s important for us to discuss where we ve got a difference of views to a point where we re ultimately able to say this is what best for the African National Congress. Meanwhile, with the KwaZulu-Natal ANC provincial general council (PGC) underway, both the Youth and Women s Leagues have used it to re-affirm their support for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.NEC members Dlamini-Zuma, Mkhize and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba are among the dignitaries at the University of Zululand.The provincial ANC has said there are no plans to discuss the leadership race ahead of the elective conference in December.But KZN ANC chair Kwazi Mshengu said young people in the province already know who they want to endorse. And I'm sure during the course of this PGC we ll get the opportunity to lobby ANC structures to agree that in the national conference, among other leaders that we ll elect those leaders must be led by comrade Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. This was followed by loud cheering and clapping.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
