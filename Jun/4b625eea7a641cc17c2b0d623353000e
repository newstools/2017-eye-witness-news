Melissa van Hoogstraten started her business 21 years ago, with a single tiny store in Kloof Street. “Starting a business really starts with a dream, and you start with something that you're passionate about, and you are forced to develop skills on a daily basis,” she said. Over two decades, it’s grown exponentially, with 17 shops operating across Cape Town and Gauteng and 6 more in the pipeline. “You need to have a very strong focus on what it is you want to achieve and what it takes to achieve that.” The growth has been entirely organic, something Van Hoogstraten attributes to passion and a sense of common purpose among her 400-strong staff.
