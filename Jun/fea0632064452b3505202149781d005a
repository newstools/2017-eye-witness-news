Theresa May was defiant in addressing the nation and committing herself to getting the best Brexit deal. LONDON - After a disastrous election for her party, British Prime Minister Theresa May will now finish assembling her new Cabinet and prepare for the start of Brexit talks.May called the election six weeks ago to secure a stronger mandate ahead of the negotiations in Brussels but landed up weakening the conservatives in Parliament.Downing Street has said May's top five ministers will remain in office, while the Tories will now have to enter into a coalition to secure a majority in the house of commons.Having lost a dozen seats in Parliament and with calls for her to resign, May was defiant in addressing the nation and committing herself to getting the best Brexit deal. That s what people voted for last June and that s what we will deliver. Now let s get to work. Later she softened her approach, promising to reflect on the election... I m sorry for all those candidates and hard working party workers who weren t successful. Brexit negotiations are due to begin in less than two weeks time.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
