The former members of the ANC&#8217;s liberation army, the MK Council, say they met on Monday to conduct an appraisal around joint preparations for an inclusive conference. JOHANNESBURG - A group of former senior MK members have announced they will boycott the African National Congress (ANC)'s policy conference later this month.They say they want nothing to do with it. The former members of the ANC s liberation army, the MK Council, say they met on Monday to conduct an appraisal around joint preparations for an inclusive conference.They have previously supported calls by ANC stalwarts for the ANC to hold a consultative conference before the policy gathering to discuss what they've described as the deteriorating state of the party.The ANC has since allocated two days for the consultative conference, something both stalwarts and the council rejected.Former MK chief of staff and commander of the South African National Defence Force Siphiwe Nyanda explained: The steering committee is of the firm view that the much-publicised National Policy Conference is a costly detraction from an effort to save the ANC. This is why the steering committee has decided it wants nothing to do with the policy conference.
