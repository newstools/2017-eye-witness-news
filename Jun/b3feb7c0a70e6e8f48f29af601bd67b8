The factional battled within the ANC&#8217;s Western Cape provincial executive committee is set to intensify after a decision to disband the Cape Town leadership. CAPE TOWN - The factional battled within the African National Congress (ANC) s Western Cape provincial executive committee is set to intensify after a decision to disband the Cape Town leadership.Provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs has indicated the Dullar Omar regional executive committee was broken up because of insubordination and its apparent inability to serve the region.But some ANC structures claim the latest decision is part of a factional battle within the provincial executive committee.At least 11 of the 35 voting provincial executive committee members are said to have walked out of the meeting that sealed the fate of the Cape Town leadership.A few others were apparently absent.Thandi Manikivana, deputy to Jacobs, was among those who rejected the decision.Several senior ANC members in the province have told Eyewitness News the move will further split the provincial executive committee, which is already divided.But Jacobs says they could no longer accept the region s failure to implement the provincial executive committee resolutions. We experienced a lot of challenges about the Dullar Omar s management and leadership style and their inability to open up the organisation to deal with the challenges that our people are facing. The provincial executive committee apparently wanted to disband the Cape Town region in April, but the ANC national executive committee intervened.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
