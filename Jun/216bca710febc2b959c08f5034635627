The SACP has shared concerns about the future of the ANC's future, saying it may be headed for a split if it approaches the elective conference divided. PRETORIA Thulas Nxesi, the South African Communist Party (SACP) deputy chairperson, has warned that the African National Congress (ANC) may be headed for a split if it approaches the elective conference divided.Nxesi, who is also an ANC national executive committee member, was speaking at Cosatu s central committee meeting in Tshwane.He says if the ANC goes to its elective conference divided, the losing group may decide to leave the party. There s evidence since 2007 when there was a breakaway. You might say it was small but it made a dent. If we re reckless this time around, I don t know what will be left. Nxesi says there are chances the DA will win elections in 2019. Imagine if the DA takes over. That s not very far when you look at the big metros they re controlling and the big budgets they re controlling. He adds the ANC-led alliance needs to ask itself hard questions about voters who have abandoned the party and who they will vote for in the next elections.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
