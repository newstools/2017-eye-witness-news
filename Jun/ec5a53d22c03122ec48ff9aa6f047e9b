The stalwarts held a briefing at Constitution Hill where they affirmed their decision to boycott this weekend&#8217;s conference. JOHANNESBURG - A group of African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts says the national policy conference will be a waste of time if delegates fail to interrogate the crises in the governing party.The stalwarts held a briefing at Constitution Hill where they affirmed their decision to boycott this weekend s conference.The first 48 hours of the policy conference will no longer be a consultative gathering so the stalwarts say they will boycott those two days as a sign of protest.Stalwart Murphy Morobe says the ANC has ignored their concerns. The ANC decided it would append it to the policy conference, we then said we are not going because to append this to the policy conference would not suit the purpose and therefore those two days are not going to involve us as veterans and stalwarts. However, the stalwarts will attend the rest of the policy conference after the two-day boycott.They also say that they will hold their own consultative conference in September.#ANCStalwarts WATCH Carolus on Gupta emails.
