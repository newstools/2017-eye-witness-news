The inquiry is set to investigate Eskom&#8217;s state of affairs and Brian Molefe's reappointment. JOHANNESBURG - Parliament's Public Enterprises committee says that an inquiry into Eskom is still waiting for crucial information from the utility to investigate the parastatal.The inquiry is set to investigate Eskom s state of affairs and Brian Molefe's reappointment.Acting chair of the committee Zukiswa Ratho says it s taking legal advice to determine how to force Eskom to submit documents and abide by its investigation. Earlier this month, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown instructed the utility's board to rescind Molefe s reappointment as the chief executive.Shortly after this, an exclusive by amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism and the Daily Maverick revealed how Molefe helped the Guptas grab a mine.It also emerged how the Gupta family had captured Eskom.Former Mining Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi made damning allegations that Molefe and Eskom chair Ben Ngubane effectively pressed him to blackmail resources giant Glencore.When he did not comply, he said that President Jacob Zuma fired him within weeks.At the time, the Gupta family were angling to buy Optimum, the coal mine that supplies Eskom s Hendrina power station.Glencore, which then owned Optimum, had placed it into business rescue in August after Molefe refused to renegotiate the price of a long-term supply contract and reinstated a disputed R2.17-billion penalty that Optimum supposedly owed for supplying substandard coal.Speaking from Limpopo on Friday, Ramatlhodi, then Minister of Mineral Resources, said he met with Molefe and Ngubane at the latter s insistence.At the meeting, they allegedly demanded that he suspend all of Glencore s mining licences in South Africa, pending the payment of the R2.17-billion penalty.Eskom had tried to issue a legal summons for the penalty on 5 August 2015, but Optimum s business rescue practitioners, appointed only the day before, batted away the claim, citing legislation which restricts new claims once a company is in business rescue.Glencore maintained that the Hendrina contract was losing it R100 million a month and it could no longer support the lossesBusiness rescue, an alternative to liquidation, puts independent managers in charge in an attempt to save a company.Ramatlhodi told amaBhungane: They insisted that I must suspend all the Glencore mining licences pending the payment of the R2 billion You must remember that the country was undergoing load-shedding at that time. I said to them: how many mines do these people have supplying Eskom? How many more outages are we going to have? A suspension of all of Glencore s licenses would have brought Glencore s 14 coal operations to a standstill and risked the jobs of its 35,000 employees in South Africa. At the time Glencore supplied roughly 14% of Eskom s coal needs, including virtually all of the coal for the Hendrina power station.Ramatlhodi said Ngubane was very insistent, but he refused: I said I m not going to shut the mines. He said Ngubane then told him that he would have to report on their meeting to Zuma straightaway as the president needed to be in the know before leaving on a foreign trip.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
