Disgruntled youngsters took matters into their own hands after a head teacher in south-west England refused requests for clothing rules to be relaxed. LONDON - Male pupils at a school in the United Kingdom have worn skirts to classes in protest at a ruling that they're not allowed to wear shorts during hot summer weather. As Britain this week recorded its hottest June day in more than 40 years, a head teacher in south-west England, refused requests for clothing rules to be relaxed. Disgruntled youngsters took matters into their own hands.Thermometers in England have topped 34 C this week, prompting boys at an academy in the cathedral city of Exeter to seek a temporary change to their school's strict clothing rules.But when they were told that only trousers and not shorts were appropriate attire, they decided to adopt the rules for their female counterparts.Girls have the choice of wearing trousers or a tartan skirt, so around 30 boys have taken the plunge and dressed to impress.With parents applauding their sons' actions, the academy's head teacher has now said she'll consider a rule change.What do boys do when shorts are not allowed?
