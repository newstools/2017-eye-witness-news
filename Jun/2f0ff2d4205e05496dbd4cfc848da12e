JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) reportedly wants an urgent meeting with Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane following the release of the third and final Mining Charter.News24 is reporting that the ruling party's economic transformation committee has raised several concerns about the new charter, specifically about the impact the raised level of black ownership to 30% could have on jobs in the sector.Thursday s announcement of the new charter had a significant impact on markets with the rand sliding back by close to 2%, while mining companies lost about R30 billion of their combined market capitalisation.South African assets fell on Thursday, with mining stocks the hardest hit after the government revamped the sector's ownership rules.Releasing the details of a revised mining charter, Zwane gave resource companies 12 months to raise the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies to 30% from 26%.Analysts said the revised charter would further tarnish the country's credentials as an investor-friendly emerging market, while the changes also drew opposition from the industry lobby group.The Chamber of Mines said it would challenge the new rules in court, arguing that there had been insufficient consultation in drawing up the charter, which is designed to widen the ownership of the South African economy. The mining index ended down 3% to a level last seen in April 2016.&quot;A lot of the pressure we're seeing in the resource stocks alongside some weakness in the currency is coming on the back of this revised mining charter and what effectively it's going to mean for fixed investments going forward,&quot; said BNP Paribas Cadiz Securities economist Jeffrey Schultz.Implementing the charter would be a significant blow to an industry that is already struggling, Schultz said.Additional reporting by Reuters.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
