I indicated that it may be in Eskom s interest to rotate the board but this would have to be balanced against continuity.

I ve had the Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr and Nkonki report for a week now, but the board would have to tell me what to do. It s an investigation by the board and the board has to write to me and tell me what actions they are going to take.&quot;(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
