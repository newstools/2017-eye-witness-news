Last week, President Zuma argued that he did not have to implement the Public Protector&#8217;s state capture report at this stage. CAPE TOWN - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says that she will oppose President Jacob Zuma s bid to have the state capture report reviewed.Last week President Zuma lodged a counter-application in the High Court in Gauteng in which he argues that he did not have to implement the Public Protector s state capture report at this stage.Zuma and other parties have lodged applications to have it reviewed by a judge.The State of Capture report, revealed by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela in November 2016, showed that Zuma failed to act on claims of state capture and that the Gupta family may have known about Des van Rooyen s appointment as finance minister before December.The report adds that the president's failure to investigate the claims made by Themba Maseko, Vytjie Mentor and Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas mean he may have broken the Prevention of Corruption Act.It also says that it s a source of concern that Cabinet seemed to take an extraordinary and unprecedented step in intervening with the relationship between the big banks and companies that employed his son Duduzane Zuma.In her report, Madonsela also goes through the conduct of Eskom and says it appears that its conduct was solely aimed at forcing the Optimum coal mine into business rescue - and then financial distress.It says that that allowed the Tegeta Company, which is owned by the Guptas, to buy the coal mine.This report also says that Minerals Minister Mosebenzi Zwane s conduct in going to Switzerland to help the Guptas buy the mine appears to have broken the Constitution.
