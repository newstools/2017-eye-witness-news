The SANDF says the robbery at the nine infantry battalion base in Khayelitsha is still under investigation. CAPE TOWN - Itâ€™s been nearly two months since an army base was robbed in Khayelitsha and there have been no arrests. It is understood a gang stormed the base and made off with several weapons. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says the robbery at the nine infantry battalion base in Khayelitsha is still under investigation. On 9 April, nine armed men are believed to have overpowered guards at the gate. They allegedly held up soldiers in the armoury guard room and forced them to open the safe. Six rifles were taken. The SANDF did not want to comment any further on the case and it remains unclear whether any of the stolen weapons have been recovered. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
