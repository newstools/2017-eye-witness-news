JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) stalwart Frene Ginwala says President Jacob Zuma is fully entitled to his views on the party s veterans but warns he should pay attention to their concerns.Ginwala is part of a group of 101 stalwarts who ve raised serious concerns about Zuma s leadership.During Zuma s speech on Friday afternoon Ginwala was seated in the front.Eyewitness News asked her for her thoughts once Zuma wrapped up. He is very entitled to it, and it speaks for itself. And if you get a group of very senior comrades saying something, you should pay more attention, you don t have to agree. Paying attention doesn t mean you agree, it means having the courtesy to listen. Earlier Zuma used his opening speech to lash out at the party's stalwarts who've raised concerns about the state of the ANC under his leadership, describing their behaviour as funny and saying the veterans think they have power.The group of stalwarts have decided to boycott the first two days of the policy conference.He says the stalwarts want to dictate terms to the ANC on how to run its business.The stalwarts signed a document containing their concerns titled: For The Sake of Our Future and sent it to the national executive committee (NEC).But Zuma claims when the NEC checked with stalwarts whose names were on the document many disassociated themselves from the petition.Ginwala also says she will investigate some of the claims made by Zuma on the stalwarts.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
