BENGALURU - American Ryan Harrison and New Zealander Michael Venus claimed their first grand slam Title when they beat Mexican Santiago Gonzalez and American Donald Young 7-6(5) 6-7(4) 6-3 in the French Open men s doubles final on Saturday.After two fiercely-contested opening sets between the two unseeded pairs, Harrison and Venus broke decisively for 5-3 and held serve to prevail on Court Philippe Chatrier.It was the pair s first major final, Harrison having never reached the last four in a grand slam while his partner had never even been in a quarterfinal. Ryan, thanks for playing. I am not very good at this, said the 29-year-old Venus, who became New Zealand s first male grand slam winner since Onny Parun teamed up with Australia s Dick Crealy to win the 1974 French Open. To all the people back home, I got lots of messages and support. To all my family watching, my mom is here watching, I wouldn t be here without you. Victory for @ryanharrison92 & Michael Venus! Their first Major title together! #RG17 pic.twitter.com/TBgx1ABUpNVenus and Harrison teamed up ahead of the clay-court season earlier this year and won their first ATP tournament in Estoril last month.
