SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni has been accused of missing a string of board meetings, while the national carrier&#8217;s financial situation is worsening. CAPE TOWN Relations between South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni and other board members have been called into question after Myeni made a lone appearance before Parliament s Standing Committee on Finance on Tuesday.The meeting was for the SAA board to give an update on the state of the national carrier's finances and progress on its turnaround strategy.Myeni told Members of Parliament (MPs) that none of the board s 11 non-executive directors were in a position to attend.MPs across all parties were not satisfied with Myeni s explanation, with the Democratic Alliance suggesting that she has lost control over the board that was appointed just nine months ago.Speaking after the meeting, Economic Freedom Fighters Chief Whip Floyd Shivambu told reporters that the party had been told by more than one board member that they had boycotted the meeting. They do not want to be associated with Dudu Myeni because she s continuing with the antics she was busy with before this new board was appointed. Myeni has been accused of missing a string of board meetings, while the national carrier s financial situation is worsening. All the scheduled meetings of the board, I attend. The Standing Committee on Finance has set down 3 August for a fresh meeting, this time stipulating that at least two other board members must attend, in addition to Myeni or her deputy, in order to properly account.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
