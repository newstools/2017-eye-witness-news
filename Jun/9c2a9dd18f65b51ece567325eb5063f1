MPs are engaged in a marathon sitting to vote on each government department's budget allocation. CAPE TOWN - Opposition MPs have suggested Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini's salary be reduced to R1 - or less. MPs are engaged in a marathon sitting to vote on each government department's budget allocation.Dlamini has come under fire for the R120 million her department has spent on overseas trips and luxury hotel stays, as well as the profit of more than a R1 billion that Cash Paymaster Services made from the social grants contract that was ruled illegal.The Freedom Front Plus's Corne Mulder says it was unacceptable for President Jacob Zuma to leave Dlamini in place in his latest Cabinet reshuffle. Social Development is such a crisis and such an important portfolio, it cannot have this situation continue one day longer. I d like to propose the amendment of the budget that the honourable minister s salary be reduced to R1. His proposal was echoed by the Congress of the People s Deidre Carter. I want to second that proposal. I actually wanted to make it 99c. Fourteen years since the establishment of Sassa, it is yet to perform the very function for which it was created.
