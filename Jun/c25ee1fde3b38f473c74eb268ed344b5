If in the policy document it talks about a particular issue that relates to leadership, then we will discuss that issue. KwaZulu-Natal will be sending the biggest delegation to next week s ANC national policy conference with 508 representatives attending.From this group the eThekwini and Moses Mabhida regions make up the largest delegations.Both these regions have been outspoken about their support for Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to take over as ANC president.The KZN branch says one of the key issues to be discussed at the council will be the failure of the party to implement resolutions taken.Zuma says the aim of the provincial general council is to consolidate their position ahead of the next week s national policy conference.He denied there s disunity among members on who to nominate as president in December. The organisation said branches must start discussing the issues of leadership starting with discussing the principles. So obviously, in any discussion, there will be different views, those different views can t be elevated to disunity. Among other things, the province will receive a political report which reflects on the current situation in KZN and nationally.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
