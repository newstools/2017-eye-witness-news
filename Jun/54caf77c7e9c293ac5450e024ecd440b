Sassa's spokesperson Kgomoco Diseko says they have met with the South African Post Office to discuss how it can help Sassa manage the payouts. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) says it will submit its first progress report to the Constitutional Court on Monday afternoon.The court ordered Sassa to file a report every quarter to ensure a new payment contractor is appointed on time.The date given by the court was Sunday but Sassa says it is normal to file the report on a Monday if the deadline falls on a weekend.In March, Cash Paymaster Services was ordered to continue to handle the payout of social grants to beneficiaries for a year but that the contract would not be renewed thereafter.This first progress report serves as a roadmap that will lead to Sassa successfully appointing a new service provider to take over the payments when Cash Paymaster's contract lapses.Sassa's spokesperson Kgomoco Diseko says they have met with the South African Post Office to discuss how it can help Sassa manage the payouts. Quite a sizeable number of companies who are in the field of banking, IT, legal and so on have responded to our request for information. After that, we re going to issue a tender and we are confident that at the end of the process we ll be able to appoint a relevant service provider. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
