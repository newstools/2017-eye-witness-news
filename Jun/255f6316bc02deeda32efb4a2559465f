Outa&#8217;s Wayne Duvenage says they are planning to present a document on state capture to Parliament tomorrow. JOHANNESBURG The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it s looking at ways to implement action against UK PR company Bell Pottinger.The company was hired by the Gupta family to do its PR but recently leaked emails suggest Bell Pottinger helped the MK Military Veterans Association and the African National Congress Youth League in their campaigns to discredit Gupta critics and those of President Jacob Zuma.Outa s Wayne Duvenage says they are planning to present a document on state capture to Parliament on Wednesday. Following that, then we start piecing together, and we ve already gone somewhere down that road, our take on Bell Pottinger and where we ll be bringing this, whether it is here or whether it is overseas. So there s no doubt in our minds that something has to be done to challenge Bell Pottinger s conduct. Meanwhile, South African expat Martin Peake is hoping to force the British government into probing PR firm Bell Pottinger.Peake has started a petition demanding that the British government consider allegations against Bell Pottinger. This has got to be a parliamentary action to condemn this type of morally corrupt corporation, one profiteer of this misery. And hopefully becomes a debate in Parliament where people actually say we cannot sit by and watch it happen. The British parliament will only respond if Peake gets more than 10,000 signatures... and the petition is halfway there.
