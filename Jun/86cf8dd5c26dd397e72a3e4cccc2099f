The chamber lodged its application on Monday after saying the minister hadn&#8217;t consulted them before publishing the charter. JOHANNESBURG Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has noted the actions taken by the Chamber of Mines in applying for an urgent interdict on the Mining Charter.Zwane says that those who support the charter support government s quest for transformation and those against it are in fact opposing transformation objectives.The chamber lodged its application on Monday after saying that the minister hadn t consulted them before publishing the charter.Zwane said: As with any legislation that is developed, it is virtually impossible to please all parties. It is unfortunate that the Chamber of Mines has chosen to take this route, but their decision is respected, and the democracy we fought for allows all of us to exercise our rights in this manner. We have confidence in the courts' ability to act with diligence on this matter. The Chamber of Mines says it wants to help transform the industry but that this new charter will inflict vast and systemic damage on the mining industry investors and the country itself.They also say that Zwane is overreaching and trying to usurp powers that should reside with Parliament.The chamber slates the language used in the charter that claiming that it is vague and contradictory and that mining companies are not able to actually work out what they are supposed to do.It says that the only way to stop this damage is for a court to issue an urgent order preventing the charter from being implemented.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
