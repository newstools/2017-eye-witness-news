While this appears not to have happened, it is known that Koko headed up a late-night meeting in April 2016 that approved a smaller, R659-million prepayment; Koko may have leaked a highly-sensitive Eskom legal opinion to the Guptas; and Koko stayed in a luxury Dubai hotel at the Guptas expense.Read the full article here.
