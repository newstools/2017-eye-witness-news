Children are placed with safety parents for a number of reasons, including neglect, being orphaned, a lack of visible support for the child and abuse. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Department of Social Development has called on more volunteers to sign up as a so-called 'safety parents'. The request has been made against the backdrop of last week's Child Protection Week. It also comes as South Africa grapples with extreme violence against young children. The department's Sihle Ngobese says anyone above the age of 18 who has been screened and trained can become a safety parent. He adds a volunteer will receive R27 a day as well as an emergency kit to assist in caring for a child who can stay with the safety parent for a maximum of three months. We currently have 646 active safety parents providing this crucial service in the province. Children are placed with safety parents for a number of reasons as outlined in the children s act. Some of these reasons include neglect, being orphaned, a lack of visible support for the child and of course, abuse and maltreatment. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
