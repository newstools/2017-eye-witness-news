Busisiwe Mkhwebane's report said govt failed to protect the public interest by bailing out Bankorp between 1985 and 1991. CAPE TOWN - Parliament has announced it will legally challenge Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's report on Absa's predecessor Bankorp bailout.Mkhwebane's report said the South African government and the Reserve Bank failed to protect the public interest by bailing out Bankorp between 1985 and 1991.She recommended Parliament change the central bank's mandate by amending the Constitution.Parliament says although the Public Protector's remedial action is binding, Mkhwebane's report effectively usurps the powers of the institution.Section 57 of the Constitution empowers the National Assembly to control its internal arrangements, proceedings, and procedures.Therefore, Parliament has decided to initiate a court application to have Mkhwebane's remedial action set aside.LISTEN: Absa explains legal action over Public Protector report
