Mmusi Maimane says the decision for Zille to step down from party structures was also in the name of reconciliation. JOHANNESBURG Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says the party decided to allow Helen Zille to continue as Western Cape premier because she runs a good government and the decision was made in the interests of reconciliation.The DA announced earlier on Tuesday that Zille will vacate positions in all decision-making structures of the party, including the federal executive, federal council and provincial council.Mmusi Maimane says Zille is doing well as premier in the Western Cape. I also have to consider the type of government we run in the Western Cape and she runs a good government. He says the decision for Zille to step down from party structures was also in the name of reconciliation. It is an idea that even if we disagree, reconciliation is always better because we are better together and I think that s important to take forward. I wanted to ensure that the party can move on and focus on the objectives of 2019. It's unclear who initiated this big political decision as Zille says she offered to step down from the structures, while Maimane says they asked her to.WATCH: DA and Zille reach settlement around colonialism tweet
