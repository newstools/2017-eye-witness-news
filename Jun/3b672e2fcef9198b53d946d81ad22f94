Calm returned to the town on Wednesday and aid workers are collecting bodies, a local Red Cross official said. BANGUI - As many as 100 people may have been killed in a day of clashes between rival factions in the Central African Republic diamond-mining town of Bria, the mayor said on Wednesday.&quot;The death toll will certainly rise. For now it's an estimate and it could be up to 100 dead,&quot; said mayor Maurice Belikoussou by telephone. &quot;There are still dead [people] lying in the neighbourhoods, in the road and in the bush,&quot; he added. &quot;Now it's an estimate and it could be up to 100 dead,&quot; he said. Calm returned to the town on Wednesday and aid workers are collecting bodies, a local Red Cross official said.Bria, the capital of the northeastern prefecture of Haute-Kotto, is coveted by militias for its surrounding diamond mines. At least 22 people were killed in clashes there last month, the United Nations said, as part of a broader escalation of a multi-year conflict driven by religious and ethnic rivalries.But Tuesday's clashes dashed hopes that a ceasefire signed between more than a dozen militias in Rome on Monday could succeed in ending a conflict that has killed thousands and displaced a fifth of the former French colony's population of 5 million.Fighting began in 2013 after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted President Francois Bozize, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias.Ethnic rivalries between the minority cattle herding Fulanis and other groups have also fuelled the conflict.
