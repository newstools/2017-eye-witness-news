There&#8217;s been mixed reaction following what appears to have been a premature announcement about the suspension of Zille. JOHANNESBURG The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape have called on Helen Zille to be removed as premier.Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane delivered feedback on the party s two-day meeting in Johannesburg at the weekend where he announced that the federal executive had resolved to suspend Zille.However, Zille alerted the party s leadership to their own constitution, which requires her to make representation as to why she should not be suspended.Zille was then served with a letter to make her representations within 72 hours.There s been mixed reaction following what appears to have been a premature announcement about the suspension of Zille.Cosatu's Tony Ehrenreich said: Well it s clearly inappropriate that you re suspended in your party but you re allowed to be a leader in government. However, Zille says she cannot be suspended yet. Certainly I have experienced them trying to get me to admit guilt, to penalise me in various ways before the hearing. At the same time, the ANC and Cosatu say that the DA have no choice but to remove Zille as premier.Meanwhile, Maimane said while he was also offended by the colonialism tweets, he reiterates that he doesn't believe Zille is racist, adding that she has contributed to South Africa s democracy.However, Zille hit back, saying that her suspension goes against the DA s constitution which affords her the opportunity to give reasons as to why she should not be suspended. I have been charged. I m happy to go to a hearing but I m not happy to have to incriminate myself before a hearing even takes place and allow the party to just impose a penalty without going through a proper process, and that s the issue here.. The ANC says Zille has a history of racist views - from her comments about professional black people, refugees and her recent comments on colonialism.And Cosatu's Ehrenreich said Zille should be removed as premier of the Western Cape. Government must respond to all of its people and if you re still holding on to the legacy of apartheid and the lessons of apartheid, you re not suitable to be in the party but neither are you suitable to be a leader of an important government institution. 'ZILLE AND I HOLD DIFFERENT VIEWS'Maimane says Zille s public utterances in connection with colonialism have damaged the party, while Zille says she rejects colonialism and apartheid but maintains that there were some benefits.He says while he was also offended by the colonialism tweets he reiterates that he doesn t believe Zille is racist, adding that she has contributed to South Africa s democracy.Maimane says he and Zille have disagreed on the direction the party needs to take in the run up to the 2019 general elections. It has become quite fundamentally clear that Premier Zille and I hold different attitudes about the direction the Democratic Alliance needs to accomplish in 2019. At the same time, Zille says she has never condoned colonialism or apartheid. I reject colonialism, reject apartheid. What I m saying is that can you repurpose aspects of its legacy, such as, for example, our Constitutional principles. Zille s suspension can now only come into effect should her recommendations be rejected by the disciplinary process.(Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
