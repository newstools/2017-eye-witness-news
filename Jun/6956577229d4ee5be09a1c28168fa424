Msimanga proposed the idea last week following a feud between informal shack dwellers and residents from formal settlements. JOHANNESBURG - Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga has made a U-turn after suggesting that a wall be built to seperate residents of Mahube Valley in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria and is now saying that he was not referring to a physical structure but was speaking hypothetically.Msimanga proposed the idea last week following a feud between informal shack dwellers and residents from formal settlements.He said he wanted to build the wall to seperate the warring sides of the community following clashes sparked by land invaders who were illegally connecting electricity.Formal bond houses were petrol bombed in the area and some shacks set alight when violence broke out between both sectors of the community.Mayoral spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi: &quot;The mayor mentioned the wall or a buffer and a slew of other random, off the top of the head proposals, to demonstrate that there needs to be a long-term plan between these communities. He did not necessarily mean a wall as in a brick and mortar in itself.
