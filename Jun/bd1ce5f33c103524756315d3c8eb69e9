Home Affairs Director General Mkuseli Apleni was briefing Parliament&#8217;s Home Affairs Portfolio Committee on the issue. PARLIAMENT - Home Affairs Director General Mkuseli Apleni has conceded Parliament was not duly informed of a decision to grant members of the Gupta family citizenship by naturalisation.The law requires the minister to submit information to the national legislature whenever applicants are granted citizenship due to exceptional circumstances.Malusi Gigaba, in his position as Home Affairs Minister, granted members of the Gupta family citizenship by waiving a provision that required applicants to be in the country for at least five years before applying.Apleni told MPs that his department s failure to submit the names to Parliament, within a specified period, was an omission. Why I did not table? I m saying there was no malice on our part to say we re hiding something. He was briefing Parliament s Home Affairs Portfolio Committee on the issue.African National Congress member Donald Gumede was quick to accept Apleni's explanation. I tend to interpret it as a question of oversight or negligence rather than a corrupt act. But the Democratic Alliance believes Gigaba should be held accountable for the failure to table the matter in Parliament.The party had previously claimed his actions were in breach of the Executive Members Ethics Act.WATCH: How the Guptas were granted citizenship in South Africa(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
