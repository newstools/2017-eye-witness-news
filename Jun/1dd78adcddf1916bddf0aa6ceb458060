Spokesperson Johan Pieterse says because of the number of ambulances at their disposal the service prioritises the more critical calls. JOHANNESBURG The Tshwane emergency services says the high call logs they experience daily are to blame for their ambulance services not being able to respond to every call.Spokesperson for the service, Johan Pieterse, says because of the number of ambulances at their disposal the service prioritises the more critical calls.This is following a medical doctor who reported that he had been told EMS had no ambulances available for a man who had collapsed on the side of the road.The doctor told Radio 702 that he had been waiting for over two hours for assistance. Two hours ago we called the Tshwane Emergency Services who simply called me on the second call, they are waiting for an ambulance to be available. Pieterse says the afternoon is one of the high peak times during which they experience a high call load. There are so many incidents reported on a daily basis that we run short on the fleet that we have on our service because we have to serve 3.3 million people. He says they will look into the call and determine why no one responded to it.
