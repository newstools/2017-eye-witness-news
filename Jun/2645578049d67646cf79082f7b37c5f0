Sassa&#8217;s spokesperson Kgomoco Diseko says Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini tried to protect the poor from these unauthorised deductions but failed. JOHANNESBURG The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) is turning to the High Court in Pretoria to apply for leave to appeal a judgment involving the unauthorised deductions from social grant beneficiaries.Last month, the High Court ruled that amendments to regulations governing the payment of social grants should not hinder deductions being made from beneficiaries bank accounts.This means that Net1 can continue to make unauthorised deductions from grant beneficiaries' bank accounts.Sassa s spokesperson Kgomoco Diseko says Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini tried to protect the poor from these unauthorised deductions but failed.Diseko says Sassa is appealing that ruling on Tuesday with the view that another court will come to a different ruling. Sassa doesn t have jurisdiction over the account of the social grants beneficiaries. Diseko says it has a duty to protect social grant beneficiaries, which it says is not happening at the moment. Put these unscrupulous service providers in their place and ensure that we protect these accounts of our beneficiaries. Sassa says deductions made by Net1 s subsidiary, Cash Paymaster Services, are working against government s programme of fighting poverty.
