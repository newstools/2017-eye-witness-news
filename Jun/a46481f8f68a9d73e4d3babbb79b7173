The DA also has a pending application in the high court to block Molefe from performing any duties as CEO. JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance (DA) will on Tuesday approach the Labour Court to intervene in Brian Molefe s application to declare his dismissal invalid.Molefe says his dismissal from the parastatal last month was unlawful.His reappointment was rescinded by the board after instruction from Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown.The DA also has a pending application in the High Court to block Molefe from performing any duties as CEO.The party s James Selfe says Molefe s Labour Court application is out of pure desperation. So we re intervening in the Labour Court to point out the fact that we ve another action in High Court and we wish to place on records that this is not simply a contractible issue. It s an issue which concerns public policy and it s much better in the Labour Court than the high court.
