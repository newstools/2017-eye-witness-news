CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament says five MPs behind a complaint to the Public Protector against the National Treasury, the Reserve Bank and other state financial institutions acted in their personal capacity.It was reported earlier this week that 90 MPs, including Cabinet ministers, and &quot;concerned citizens&quot; wanted the state capture probe to include the Financial Intelligence Centre, the Public Investment Corporation and the Financial Services Board.Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown have since denied putting their signatures to the complaint.The ANC s Nonceba Mhlauli says Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu on Thursday met with the five MPs who submitted the complaint.&quot;The comrades have clarified they were acting in their individual capacities and not as representatives of the ANC parliamentary caucus or any other study group of the ANC in Parliament and that whatever is written in the complaint is their own views.&quot;The ANC's national executive committee resolved at the weekend that a judicial commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture be launched without delay, with terms of reference broad enough to examine the influence of business on the government.Mthembu says this remains the position of the ANC's parliamentary caucus and that he's unaware of any other MPs being involved, except for the five, whom he did not name.The Public Protector s office has confirmed receiving the complaint.
