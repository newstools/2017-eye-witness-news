An Israeli border policewoman and three Palestinians were killed in two simultaneous attacks last night. JERUSALEM - Isis has claimed responsibility for an attack on Jerusalem in which at least four people were killed, warning that &quot;this will not be the last&quot;.An Israeli border policewoman and three Palestinians were killed in two simultaneous attacks last night.Israel has now cancelled permits allowing Palestinians from the West Bank to visit family members inside Israel, although permits to visit Jerusalem for prayers during Ramadan are still in place.This is the first time Isis has taken responsibility for an attack in Israel.An Israeli border policewoman died from her wounds early on Saturday morning after being stabbed in Jerusalem s Old City on Friday night.It was one in two incidents in which three Palestinians armed with semi-automatic weapons and knives attacked Israeli guards in the Old City.All three were shot dead by security forces at the scene. The assailants came from West Bank and were between the ages of 18 and 19.All three had been arrested in the past on terror related suspicions.A wave of Palestinian street attacks began in October 2015 but has since slowed. Israel blames the violence on incitement by the Palestinian leadership.The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, denies that and says assailants have acted out of frustration over Israeli occupation of land sought by Palestinians in peace talks that have been stalled since 2014.Meanwhile, Palestinian militant factions denied on Saturday the Islamic State's claim that three Palestinian men who carried out a fatal shooting and stabbing attack in Jerusalem were members of the militant group.A senior official from Hamas, the Islamic group that rules the Gaza Strip, and the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the three attackers, who were all shot dead at the scene, were their own members.&quot;The three hero martyrs who executed the Jerusalem operation have no connection to Daesh (Islamic State), they are affiliated with the PFLP and Hamas,&quot; Hamas' Izzat El-Reshiq wrote on Twitter.The PFLP published a separate statement in which it identified two of the three attackers as members. &quot;The media office of the PFLP armed wing mourns two of its hero comrades, two freed prisoners,&quot; it said.Additional reporting by Reuters.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
