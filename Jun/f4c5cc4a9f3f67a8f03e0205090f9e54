The Constitutional Court is on Thursday expected to make a ruling on the UDM&#8217;s application to allow for a secret ballot in Parliament. JOHANNESBURG - The Constitutional Court is on Thursday expected to make a ruling on the United Democratic Movement (UDM) s application to allow for a secret ballot in Parliament.The UDM approached the court last month, asking it to give Parliament the go ahead to vote in secret during a proposed motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma.The debate around the fifth motion of no confidence was scheduled for April following Zuma s controversial Cabinet reshuffle, but it was postponed by National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete on the request of opposition parties to wait on the outcome of the court s decision.Mbete s legal counsel argued that there is no obligation on her part to hold a secret ballot because the rules of Parliament do not provide for it.But the UDM relied on the National Assembly Rule 103 and 104, pointing out that the rules are clear that the Speaker has the discretion to determine the voting procedure to be followed for any vote.The UDM even went further to say that Mbete failed in her constitutional obligation to use that discretion to arrange for secret voting.It was also argued that an open ballot would render Parliament unable to hold the president accountable, with the Economic Freedom Fighters pointing out that MPs are entitled to vote according to their conscience because their duty is to the electorate and the Constitution.In a surprising turn, the president s lawyer conceded that there was no downside to the secret ballot, while Mbete s lawyers also conceded that the Speaker has the discretion to allow for a secret ballot.(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
