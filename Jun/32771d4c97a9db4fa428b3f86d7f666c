It&#8217;s understood Gigaba appointed a close Gupta associate to the Transnet board who was in charge of procurement. JOHANNESBURG Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says his party can prove beyond reasonable doubt that Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba is involved in state capture and the Transnet locomotives scandal.Last week, it was revealed in leaked Gupta emails, that associates of the controversial family scored billions of rands in alleged kickbacks to help a Chinese firm win lucrative Transnet tenders.The emails detail how CSR Hong Kong won the tender to supply 359 locomotives to Transnet in 2014 when Gigaba was Public Enterprises Minister.It is understood that Gigaba appointed a close Gupta associate to the Transnet board who was in charge of procurement.Malema is laying charges against Gigaba at the Johannesburg Central Police Station on Friday and says he s confident the evidence they have against the minister is legitimate. We re attaching that letter to demonstrate to South Africans that Malusi Gigaba was involved in the procurement of the locomotives and that s why he kept on reminding people to flout the rules and not even talk to Treasury, including undermining Treasury and talking to him directly if they wanted to continue with any other procurement.
