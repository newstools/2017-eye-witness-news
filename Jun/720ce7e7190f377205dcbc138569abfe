Premier Zille launched an investigation after claims Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela's surprise birthday party was paid for by building contractors. CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela has come under fire in the provincial legislature over corruption claims related to his birthday party. Premier Helen Zille launched an investigation after claims Madikizela's surprise birthday party was paid for by building contractors who do business with the provincial government. The probe cleared the acting Democratic Alliance provincial leader of any wrongdoing. But during a sitting of legislature early on Thursday, African National Congress members of the legislature brought up the matter and accused Madikizela of misleading the provincial parliament. The ANC's Sharon Davids said: We want to know specifically in this house MEC, who are those friends who organised your party and why did you not tell this house of the people who are getting money from your department who organised your party? Madikizela said: &quot;What is relevant here, is whether any person who is doing business with my department contributed to my party. And the answer is 'no'. The second question 'who are my friends', Quite frankly, it's none of this member's business who my friends are.&quot; (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
