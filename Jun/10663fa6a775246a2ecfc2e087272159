Two websites have emerged as part of a strategy to counter the waves of damning reports. PRETORIA - Former Business Day editor Peter Bruce says he was shocked when he saw clandestine surveillance pictures of himself on a pro-Gupta website.Bruce says he won t be deterred from doing his work. Two websites, White Monopoly Capital Leaks and White Monopoly Capital Scams, have emerged as part of a strategy to counter the waves of damning reports on the so-called Gupta leaks. A report uploaded on Monday included photos of Bruce with his wife in a park and others of him having lunch at a restaurant with friends. #GuptaTwitter the surveillance report shows Bruce was followed and photographed for several days. BB pic.twitter.com/REDhTmUtJeThe South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) has described the surveillance as a clear threat to media freedom.Bruce says that whoever conducted the surveillance did it to intimidate him and believes he knows who s behind it. The Guptas, in particular, are cowards. They hide behind proxies and never do anything out on their own. They are always going to try and silence criticism. I think whether you re investigating, commentating or reporting, do your best and do it honestly and don t worry about them. Sanef s Sam Mkokeli says this worrying development is a threat to media freedom. This is an attempt to shut up a very strong and necessary voice in the South African landscape. It s intimidation of the media. Mkokeli has urged the police to help track down the culprits.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
