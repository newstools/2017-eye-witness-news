Some people have been evacuated from Plettenberg Bay, 100 people from Robberg and Piesangvallei; we re also using the Go George buses in that areas. Some of the evacuations may continue if and when needed, but we don t foresee any mass evacuations like last night. The Western Cape government's Colin Deiner says it's unclear how the blaze started. Generally at this time of the year we have a number of fires that start due to various reasons. The reason why this was so intense is because we had gale force winds and that was pushing it along.
