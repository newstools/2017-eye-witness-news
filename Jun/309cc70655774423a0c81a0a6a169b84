In May, Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo visited the Pinetown facility where he personally conducted autopsies. DURBAN - The Medical Right s Network says there is a crisis waiting to happen at KwaZulu-Natal mortuaries with 80 autopsies still outstanding six months later, with the bodies now beginning to decompose.Fifty unidentified bodies have remained unattended at the Pinetown mortuary and another 30 at Fort Napier.In May, Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo visited the Pinetown facility where he personally conducted autopsies.Dhlomo and his department have recently been in the spotlight for failing to provide treatment for cancer patients because radiotherapy equipment in the province has not been working and there are no longer any oncologists working in the region.The Medical Rights Network s Mary de Haas says there are only nine radiologists in KZN and the conditions at mortuaries in the province are an occupational health hazard. So far I understand that the people who work there most of them have no qualifications so the department is in breach of the national health legislation. The Democratic Alliance s Imraan Keeka says the resident pathologist at the mortuary is frequently absent and now there is a backlog. Those bodies are unidentified bodies and require proper burial. The complication with these 50 bodies is that no postmortems have been done and most of them are in serious states of decomposition.&quot;The KZN Health Department has been unavailable for comment so far.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
