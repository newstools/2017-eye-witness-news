Malusi Gigaba's spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete says that the Finance Minister has not done anything to help himself or the Guptas. JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba's spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete says the Gupta emails claiming he helped them land massive deals don't prove that he's guilty of anything wrong.On Thursday, the SACP's second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila said Gigaba should step down because people implicated in the emails could not be trusted by the general population.After Gigaba was appointed to the Public Enterprises portfolio in late 2010, he shook up the state-owned companies under his control.The emails appear to show how a person appointed by Gigaba to Transnet's board arranged a deal where they received one-fifth of the value of every locomotive it bought - this equates to R10 million from each R50 million locomotive that Transnet is buying.The #GuptaLeaks also reveal new evidence that immigration officials may have been captured by the Guptas - including two who were specially positioned in India by Gigaba s office when he was Home Affairs Minister.Emails show how senior Gupta employee Ashu Chawla repeatedly asked these two and other officials to fast-track visas to benefit Gupta businesses as they moved dozens of employees, associates and family members between South Africa, India and Dubai.In a string of emails, a Home Affairs official says Gigaba had signed an instruction for the two officials to be moved to offices in Mumbai and New Delhi respectively. However, Gigaba s actual signed letter was not attached to the #GuptaLeaks email.At least one of the two officials already had a long-standing relationship with the Guptas and their lieutenant, Chawla, through private business projects and having apparently helped with visas in the past.Tshwete says people are right to be worried about corruption, but that Gigaba has not done anything to either help himself or the Guptas.
