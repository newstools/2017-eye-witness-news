Zweli Mkhize says there's a gap in the banking sector with no dedicated institution to help empower black entrepreneurs. JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress (ANC) treasurer general Zweli Mkhize  says there's a gap in the banking sector with no dedicated institution to help empower black entrepreneurs. Mkhize was speaking at the opening of the ANC's progressive business forum financial sector summit in Johannesburg on Friday. He says many issues need to be discussed at the forum and the upcoming ANC policy conference to ensure economic growth. Mkhize says banks that support black entrepreneurs are essential. “It’s a big issue, because in the past there was a clear line; it was what was called the red-ling; ‘If you in the township, sorry we can’t assist you’. But now a little bit of that you will still find. It is difficult to go to the banks as a black entrepreneur and get the support that you would otherwise get if you were not a black entrepreneur.”
