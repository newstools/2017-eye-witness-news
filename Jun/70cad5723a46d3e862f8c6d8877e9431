The British parliament will only respond if Martin Peake gets more than 10,000 signatures... and the petition is halfway there. CAPE TOWN - South African expat Martin Peake is hoping to force the British government into probing PR firm Bell Pottinger.The company was engaged by the Gupta family to do their Company s PR.But reports and content from the Gupta email leaks suggest they were doing more than standard public relations.amaBhungane says the emails reveal that Bell Pottinger helped the MK Military Veterans Association and the ANC Youth League in their campaigns to discredit Gupta critics and those of President Jacob Zuma.Peake has started a petition demanding that the British government consider allegations against Bell Pottinger. This has got to be a parliamentary action to condemn this type of morally corrupt corporation, one profiteer of this misery. And hopefully becomes a debate in Parliament where people actually say we cannot sit by and watch it happen. The British parliament will only respond if Peake gets more than 10,000 signatures... and the petition is halfway there.Meanwhile, in South Africa, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) is considering legal action against the British company. We ve already engaged with our senior council on this matter. Our legal team, which we have a formidable team here, is already piecing this case together. One of the key decisions for Outa s legal team will be whether to bring an action in the South African courts, or in Britain.LISTEN: Bell Pottinger protects its tweets(Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
