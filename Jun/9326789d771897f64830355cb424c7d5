JOHANNESBURG - A court in New Zealand has ruled in favour of authorities there that a blind, disabled five-year-old child from South Africa must be deported because of her medical condition.In a high court judgment released last week, Justice Gerald Nation ruled that Caitlyn Davies be sent back to South Africa after the girl's family appealed the move. Immigration New Zealand argued that her condition would place a burden on the country's health services. In 2015, Davies father Jonathan arrived in New Zealand from South Africa and was granted a one-year work visa. He took a job as a farm manager in the small Canterbury town of Geraldine. A few months later Caitlyn, her two-year-old brother and her mother arrived. But in May last year, while her relatives' visas were extended, Caitlyn s was denied because she was not considered to be of an acceptable standard of health. Nation last week ruled that no error was made when determining that her medical needs would impose a burden on the country's special education services. Caitlyn's parents believe that their daughter should remain in New Zealand because of the poor employment opportunities and limited educational and medical facilities for children with disabilities in South Africa.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
