JOHANNESBURG - Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela says what government is doing under the concept of radical economic transformation is wrong. Madonsela says a policy that has not been consulted on, written down or made clear cannot be implemented.She was speaking on the sidelines of a democracy dialogue at Constitution Hill, which was hosted by her foundation on Friday.Madonsela told Eyewitness News implementing an idea like radical economic transformation, which has not been written down and consulted on, is unconstitutional.She says the reason is that there needs to be accountability, adding that government can do all sorts of things in the name of radical economic transformation. There is the possibility that it s going to be a blanket that encourages wrongdoing. How do you challenge it? She says South Africa has the Equality Act, which is the policy meant to advance economic and social transformation.
