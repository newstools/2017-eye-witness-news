CAPE TOWN - Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo says the process that led to the firing of Hlaudi Motsoeneng from the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) was fair.She is now considering seconding officials from government departments to act in a caretaker capacity in top posts at the broadcaster, while permanent replacements are sought. The SABC s interim CEO Tsediso Ralitabo is briefing Parliament s communications portfolio committee on expected losses of R1.1 billion for the 2016/17 financial year.High personnel costs, expenditure on capital projects and controversial decisions on local content and music quotas have been cited as reasons for a decline in revenue and in audience numbers.Acting chief executive officer Tseliso Ralitabo says the SABC s performance for the last quarter, which ended in March, shows an operating loss of R509 million. Dlodlo says she is satisfied with the decision to axe Motsoeneng. They considered many things that happened, including court judgments and the Public Protector s report. Dlodlo says she s concerned that the broadcaster is overstaffed with skills that won t necessarily assist in the urgent digital migration process.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
