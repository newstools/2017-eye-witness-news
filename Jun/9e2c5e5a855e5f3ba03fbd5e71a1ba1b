Kameraz store manager Ryan Cumming says the suspects who robbed the store on Friday morning seem to have scoped the store before. JOHANNESBURG - The Kameraz store in Rosebank has described the armed robbery that took place in early hours of Friday morning as well-orchestrated, adding the robbers knew exactly what they wanted. It’s understood five men forced entry into the mall, making off with an undisclosed amount of items. No one was injured and no arrests have yet been made. The only trace of what happened is the smashed glass doors both at the main entrance of the mall and at the Kameraz store. Store Manager Ryan Cumming says the robbery was well planned. “So when they came in they went directly for specific items and the high-ticket items. They knew exactly what they wanted.” He says he hopes CCTV footage will assist authorities in tracking down the robbers. “Basically from looking at the CCTV footage, what we can see it looks like they’d sort of scoped the store before.” It's business as usual at the mall this afternoon as police investigate.
