The Constitutional Court has ruled that the Speaker has the power to prescribe that a motion of no confidence in the president be conducted by secret ballot. JOHANNESBURG - Parliament has confirmed that it has received a letter from the opposition DA requesting a date for a motion of no-confidence vote in President Jacob Zuma.This comes after Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng delivered the Constitutional Court judgment that the Speaker does have the power to prescribe that a motion of no confidence in the president be conducted by secret ballot under appropriate circumstances.The matter was brought by the UDM, EFF and Cope last month, asking the court to give Parliament the go ahead to vote in secret in a motion of no confidence against the president.Mogoeng says Mbete was wrong to say a secret ballot vote is not allowed in a motion of no confidence, clarifying that parliamentary rules 103 and 104 do empower the Speaker to prescribe for secret voting.After the ruling the African National Congress in Parliament said that it would defeat the motion of no confidence. We reiterate our long stated position that we will not support the motion of no confidence on President Jacob Zuma by opposition parties. We will defeat this motion of no confidence by the opposition as we have successfully done so in the previous 4 motions tabled in this 5th term of Parliament, the ANC said in a statement following the ruling.Meanwhile, Mbete says she will give effect to the Constitutional Court ruling.
