A report by the Auditor-General last year revealed that the SAPS had at least 103 members doing business with SAPS, a higher proportion than many other departments. CAPE TOWN - The nation's new acting police commissioner has been given a roasting by Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). Committee members took Lesetja Mothiba and top officials to task for failing to deal with South African Police Services (Saps) members alleged to have been doing business with the department. The Public Administration Management Act makes it illegal for government employees to do business with the government. A report by the office of the Auditor-General last year revealed that the SA police service had at least 103 members doing business with Saps, a higher proportion than many other departments. A list of 32 sample cases given to Saps by the Auditor General’s office nearly a year ago includes the name of former top cop Riah Phiyega. Scopa members were unimpressed on hearing the cases are all still under investigation. Inkatha Freedom Party MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa said: “When those in charge are complicit or are alleged to be aiding and abetting or part and parcel of the shortcoming, you’ve got a problem.” It was a baptism of fire for Mothiba, making his first appearance before Scopa. He’s promised speedy action and a detailed progress report by the end of the month. (Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
