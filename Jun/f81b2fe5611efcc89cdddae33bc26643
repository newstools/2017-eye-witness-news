WATCH: Tears &amp; Trauma: Forensic strike leaves over 200 incomplete autopsiesA visibly angry Memory Molefe bang on the gate of the Germiston mortuary, demanding to get answers on why her uncle s remains have not been released.She says the department knew about the strike for days and should have made alternative arrangements. If they could send four pathologists to come over here, I m sure they would have done the job by now. I m not a doctor but how long does it take to open someone? Tiger Godfrey Karecha says the police took his mother s body to the Germiston mortuary despite knowing that the pathologists were on strike. They could have taken the bodies to another facility like Springs or other facilities around the East Rand area.
