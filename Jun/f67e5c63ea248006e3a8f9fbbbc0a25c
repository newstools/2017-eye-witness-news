JOHANNESBURG Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown is expected to address several controversial Eskom issues at a briefing on Friday, including the reasons behind her decision to appoint Johnny Dladla as the utility s acting CEO.On Thursday, the board announced that Dladla, who s been at Eskom for 22 years, has been appointed as the acting CEO to bring stability to the company in the short term.Last month, Brown instructed the board to rescind the reappointment of Brian Molefe as CEO as recommended by an inter-ministerial committee which she was part of.Brown is expected to deal with controversies surrounding Eskom at its annual general meeting this morning and then she will address the media.She stated last month that she would appoint an acting CEO within 48 hours to ensure continuity but it took her 22 days to decide on Dladla for the position.Eskom says it had intense consultations with Brown to arrive at a prudent choice.Today, the minister will also have an opportunity to salvage her integrity and Eskom s reputation if she appoints a strong board that can attend to many of the utility s problems.Brown may also decide the fate of former acting CEO Matshela Koko, who has reportedly been cleared of any wrongdoing.
