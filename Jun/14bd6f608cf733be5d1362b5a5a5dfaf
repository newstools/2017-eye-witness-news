The details are contained in a legal letter sent to Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and Police Minister Fikile Mbalula on Thursday. PRETORIA The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has issued an ultimatum to the South African Police Service (SAPS) to refrain from raiding their offices or give them warning of a proposed raid, or they will approach the High Court for an interdict.The details are contained in a legal letter sent to Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and Police Minister Fikile Mbalula on Thursday.Ipid revealed on Wednesday that it had obtained reliable information, which indicated the police intended raiding its offices, a claim Phahlane has strongly denied.Adams &amp; Adams attorney Jac Marais says in a legal letter that Ipid wants an undertaking from the police that a raid on his client s offices or its officials will not take place. However, if police intend on executing the raid, Marais says they want an undertaking that the parties can agree to adequate measures and procedures to protect the integrity of investigations and the identities of complainants. Failure to provide such an undertaking by 4pm on Thursday 1 June will see Ipid approach the High Court for relief. Marais has informed the police that Ipid is in possession of legally privileged information, such as details of whistleblowers, complainants and witnesses. He says the proposed raid would undermine the perception of Ipid having sufficient guarantees to protect its independence from the police.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
