Workers are demanding compensation similar to pathologist for the work they&#8217;ve been doing. JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says that the strike by assistant pathologists at Gauteng government mortuaries is &quot;grossly unfair&quot; and amounts to blackmailing.Three weeks ago, assistant pathologists affiliated to Nehawu went on strike resulting in autopsies not being conducted at facilities.They're demanding compensation similar to pathologists for the work they ve been doing.The SANDF health professionals were called in to help with the backlog last week, while several families had to postpone their loved one's burials.Motsoaledi says no matter how angry employees are, no one can hold bereaved families at ransom. It is unfair to blackmail and hold ransom families who are bereaved. The Public Health Bargaining Council seems to have made some progress which could see the strike come to an end before the end of the week.(Edited by Shimoney Regter)
