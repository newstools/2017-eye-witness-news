The blockade has been ongoing for two weeks and the blockading nations have offered no formula for resolving the crisis, Sheikh Saif Bin Ahmed al-Thani, Director of Qatar s Government Communications Office, said in a statement. It is unfortunate that our neighbours have chosen to invest their time and resources in a baseless propaganda campaign... The blockading nations are using terrorism as a publicity stunt.
