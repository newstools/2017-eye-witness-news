The DA believes it and EFF have a material interest in Molefe's court bid to return to Eskom as its CEO and should be cited as respondents in the Labour Court matter. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants to intervene in Brian Molefe's Labour Court bid to get his job back at Eskom.The party says it views Molefe's court action as nothing more than desperation.The matter, scheduled to be heard in Johannesburg on Monday, was postponed to give responding parties more time to file papers.The DA believes it and the Economic Freedom Fighters have a material interest in Molefe's court bid to return to Eskom as its chief executive officer and should be cited as respondents in the Labour Court matter.Molefe is challenging a decision by the Eskom board to rescind his reappointment, premised on the notion that the original decision to reinstate him in May is valid.An interministerial committee has found it was not.The DA says it's inappropriate for the Labour Court to hear Molefe's application on the validity of the decision to reinstate him because the matter is already pending in the High Court.The party will be approaching the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday to prohibit Molefe from going to any Eskom business sites until the Labour Court matter has been concluded.(Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
