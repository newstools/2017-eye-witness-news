Molefe has approached the Labour Court, serving papers on both Eskom and Minister Lynne Brown after they rescinded the decision to reappoint him as CEO.

Following a harsh backlash from the African National Congress, the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters an inter-ministerial committee concluded that Minister Brown should order the board to rescind Molefe s appointment.The parties said his reappointment was questionable considering his resignation was after former public protector Thuli Madonsela implicated him in the State of Capture report.On Friday, the board said it had annulled Molefe s reappointment.Its spokesperson Khulani Qoma said: Essentially what the board did in a special meeting on Friday was to abide by the directive of the minister. They took a resolution which was to rescind a decision as specified by the minister, as well as the reinstatement agreement concluded between Molefe and Eskom on 11 May 2017 also be rescinded.
