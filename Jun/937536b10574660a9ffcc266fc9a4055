The previous ANC leadership in the Northern Cape strongly criticised Premier Sylvia Lucas's reshuffle and after its leadership conference, the new leadership ordered her to reverse it. JOHANNESBURG -The African National Congress (ANC) in the Northern Cape says that it will refuse to accept the refusal by Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas to rescind her reshuffle.Lucas made changes to her Cabinet just before a party provincial congress, where she lost her bid to become leader of the provincial ANC. The provincial party ordered her a week ago to reverse a reshuffle she carried out just before the provincial conference.They had already met with the ANC s top six national leaders, who also agreed that her behaviour was unacceptable. She was contesting the position of Northern Cape leader but then refused nomination, claiming that the election had been rigged against her.The previous ANC leadership in the Northern Cape strongly criticised Lucas reshuffle. Then after its leadership conference, the new leadership ordered her to reverse it.But she has so far refused to move.Northern Cape ANC provincial secretary Deshi Nxanga says this is unacceptable. She committed to rescind it by 1 June. And today you can sense, it s actually a week after she agreed to rescind the decision, and the decision is not rescinded. He also says that this kind of behaviour can break the ANC.ANC SLAMS LUCAS BEHAVIOURThe ANC in the Northern Cape says that the behaviour of Lucas in refusing to rescind her reshuffle is the kind of behaviour that will break the ANC. But Nxanga says she is refusing to budge. I don t think that builds the ANC, that breaks the party. We advised her last week to rescind the decision after we consulted with the national officials of the ANC and she s aware of that and yet she s still hanging on. Lucas had previously agreed to rescind the reshuffle but the people who lost their jobs have still not been sworn in.(Edited by Zinhle Nkosi)
