Rights activists are appealing for food for some of the medical students evicted from the University of Zimbabwe. HARARE - Rights activists are appealing for food for some of the medical students evicted from the University of Zimbabwe (UZ). An estimated 600 students were told to leave on Monday after some of them staged a protest over high fees. Pictures shared on social media on Monday night showed students huddled under blankets after they were ordered to leave halls of residences at the UZ in Harare.  The evictions were ordered after a demonstration by students over high fees. University authorities accused them of throwing stones, saying this was behaviour the university doesn’t tolerate. Activists on Tuesday appealed to well-wishers to drop food off for some students who took shelter at a church in Harare’s Avondale suburb. The Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights is understood to be preparing an urgent court application to challenge the evictions.  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
