                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police are investigating the murder of husband to well-known author and speaker Nikki Bush after he was shot in the chest during a house robbery.  Bush says her husband Simon was shot in the early hours of on Saturday morning when he tried to stop two gunmen from coming into the house.  Bush says her son was then held at gunpoint. The creative parenting expert author has often been the go to person on subjects of child development and parenting.  Her sister Justine Heydra says her sisters’ children are dealing with the trauma. “Matthew is a mess. Obviously he witnessed everything and was first on the scene. He’s 19 and he’s currently writing matric. It’s very tough for him and he still has three more exams to go.”  Heydra says the intruders took two laptops, two cellphones and Bush’s handbag.
