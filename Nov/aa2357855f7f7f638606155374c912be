                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier David Makhura has called on all stakeholders to be involved and tackle the fight against gender-based violence. Addressing hundreds of people at the Huntersfield Stadium in Katlehong, Makhura says the abuse of women and children will not happen under government watch. He's leading the launch of the provincial 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children campaign. Makhura says the government wants to empower women so that they can stay in relationships because of love and not because they are dependent on men. He says women should be independent and not fall prey to abusers. “We made it very clear that there is no way we can overcome the scourge unless we mobilise and work through a multi-stakeholder approach in a very comprehensive way to tackle every aspect of this abuse.” The national 16 Days of Activism campaign was officially launched at the Nelson Mandela University in the Eastern Cape on Saturday morning, where President Jacob Zuma withdrew his attendance shortly after the event started. The launch event was set to start at 9 am but at 10:30, a letter from the Presidency announced Zuma would be a no-show, saying the Presidency's Susan Shabangu would attend instead. The campaign called 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence will run until 10 December, with this year's theme as ‘Count Me In: Together Moving a Non-Violent South Africa Forward’.  16 candles are being lit to say let the light shine for all victims of abuse, and to show support #16DaysofActivism pic.twitter.com/bemjCSkrWF  The Theme for 2017 is: “COUNT ME IN: TOGETHER MOVING A NON-VIOLENT SOUTH AFRICA FORWARD.” 2017 being the Year of OR Tambo, the Sub-theme is: “OR Tambo and the emancipation of women” #16DaysOfActivism pic.twitter.com/5Iael9y4Mh
