                                         JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng leader John Moodey says his goal going into the 2019 elections is to increase the DA’s votes by 1.5 million to ensure the party takes over governing the province.  The party provincial leadership, mayors and leader Mmusi Maimane addressed the more than 1,000 members attending the DA elective congress in Midrand on Saturday where Moodey was re-elected DA Gauteng leader. Cachalia tried his best to convince the members that the provincial leadership needs change but was booed by some when he mentioned what he believed to be flaws in the voting process. “You have seen the effects of those mismanagement of membership, thousands of members disenfranchised, hundreds of delegates disqualified from congress. This is not what democracy is about.” While Moodey says he ran a clean campaign and is focused on attracting more votes. “I always ran my campaign clean. We respect the fact that campaigns can be dirty and bruising. I have lost before and I put my shoulder to the wheel and supportive to the provincial leader.” Once Moodey was announced the winner he was joined on stage by Cachalia.
