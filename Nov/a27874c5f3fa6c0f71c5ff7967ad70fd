                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says the body of the slain soldier who was killed in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will be brought to the country on Friday. Nomathemba Ngeleka was shot and killed by her fellow soldier who they were in a relationship with, before turning the gun on himself. The soldier remains in stable but critical condition at the Goma Hospital since last week’s shooting. The SANDF says the body will be officially handed over to the family during the ceremony at the Waterkloof Air Force Base on Saturday. Spokesperson Mafi Mgobozi said: “The body of the soldier who passed away in DRC last week will arrive in SA on Friday. The other soldier is still in the DRC.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
