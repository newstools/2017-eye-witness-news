                                         JOHANNESBURG - Author and journalist Jacques Pauw says he'll happily assist law enforcement agencies with information to investigate a number of culprits who are accused of wrongdoing in his new book. Pauw's new book titled The President's Keepers, contains allegations against President Jacob Zuma relating to corruption and irregularities with his tax affairs. The South African Revenue Service and the State Security Agency have issued statements, saying they intend taking legal action against Pauw and his publisher. But Pauw says his information is credible and he hasn't broken any laws. “We need the law enforcement agencies to investigate this and bring the culprits to book. I’ve said from the beginning that if any credible law enforcement agent contacts me and sits down with me, saying I should help them in the investigation, I will help them. But to shoot the messenger is not going to resolve anything.” Read the full State Security Agency's cease and desist letter below:    Cease Desist by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd  He insists that he hasn't published anything unlawfully. “We will say the information we have printed is credible, that I’m legally entitled to the information and that I have not broken any law.” Pauw says he hasn't breached the State Security Act. “We will show and prove that the information we received about the State Security Act, the first operation that they ran a few years ago, the principal agents project, I cannot endanger the lives of agents because this project doesn’t exist anymore.” NB Publishers say they have received a cease and desist letter from the State Security Agency, demanding that they withdraw the book from all stores. The publisher says it stands by Pauw and his book. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
