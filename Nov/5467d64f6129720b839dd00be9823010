                                         PARYS - The South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Solly Mapaila claims there's been vote rigging in the fiercely contested Metsimaholo by-election where the communist party and African National Congress (ANC)  are going head-to-head for the first time. The SACP took a resolution to contest future elections at its congress earlier this year. The polls come after the municipality's former coalition government between the DA, EFF, the Freedom Front Plus and the Metsimaholo Civic Association (MCA) was dissolved in July after the mayor defected to the ANC. Mapaila claims there have been irregularities in the voting process. “There’s been some buses that arrived here, some last night and some this morning, with dozens of people coming to participate.” He says in some cases dead people were registered to vote. “Someone was registering for people without talking to them and special vote is a specific thing.” But the ANC has dared him to bring evidence of all this. It’s also urging him and other contesting parties to refrain from making statements without providing proof.  NO REGRETS The man responsible for the dissolution of the Metsimaholo Municipality and the subsequent by-election says he doesn't regret ever defecting to the ANC. Sello Hlasa was seen visiting stations as part of the ANC on Wednesday. He says he regrets nothing about his move. “I don’t regret anything because remember, MCA is a potpourri of people from political organisations and even non-political people.”
