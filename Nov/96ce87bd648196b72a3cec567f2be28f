                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Health Department is on Friday expected to provide details around a safety and security plan for emergency workers. There have been more than 60 attacks on emergency personnel in the province this year. In the most recent incident, criminals held up an ambulance crew at gunpoint on the N2 with a critically injured in the back of the vehicle. The eight-year-old boy subsequently died. Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo says the new plan involves more collaboration with neighbourhood watches. “The other thing that needs to be confirmed is the deployment of the military. The premier (Helen Zille) has already requested this. We’re just waiting on the president.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
