                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe’s former finance minister Tendai Biti  has highlighted the major economic, constitutional and political changes the country has to undergo.  Biti was speaking at the Daily Mavericks ‘The Gathering’ which is underway at the Sandton Convention Center.  African National Congress presidential candidates Lindiwe Sisulu, Zweli Mkhize and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma  pulled out of the event two days ago.  Biti joked that former President Robert Mugabe, his wife Grace and their children have left the throne. “And the minute that two of them, the husband himself declared that the baton stick was going to be passed to her there was a problem. Isn’t that the challenge in Africa, that we can’t pass the baton stick?” But Biti says Zimbabwe still has a lot of work to do. “It’s the restoration of the social contract and part of the restoration of the social contract means a programme of national healing. Zimbabwe is tattered and torn by hatred, by intolerance.” United Democratic Movement leader Holomisa, former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and EFF leader Julius Malema are also expected to speak on Thursday afternoon.
