A group of disgruntled pro-Cyril Ramaphosa ANC members known as "the rebels" took the KZN PEC to court, claiming that there were irregularities with the 2015 elective conference. DURBAN - Another courtroom battle between divided African National Congress (ANC) members is expected in the Pietermaritzburg High Court, with the KwaZulu-Natal executive applying to appeal a ruling that nullifies the collective. In September, Judge Jerome Mnguni declared the 2015 provincial elective conference unlawful and void. A group of disgruntled pro-Cyril Ramaphosa ANC members known as "the rebels" took the KZN PEC to court, claiming that there were irregularities with the gathering. The KZN ANC maintains that the court judgment found no irregularities with how the conference was convened but made a ruling based on clause 17 of the party’s constitution which speaks about when such a gathering should take place. Spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli says the interpretation of this has wide-reaching effects for the organisation and the NEC agrees. “Wars at a legal and political level, we’re expecting that the secretary-general or anybody else that’s admitted by the SG should also come to court.” Meanwhile, Ramaphosa campaign spokesperson in KZN, Sthembiso Mshengu, says they want the PEC to vacate the provincial offices. Mshengu says they have added another senior legal representative to their team which will strengthen their chances of winning.
