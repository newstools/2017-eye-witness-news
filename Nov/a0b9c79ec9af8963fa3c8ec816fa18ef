                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has failed to secure a motion of no confidence vote against Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and speaker Vasco da Gama during Wednesday’s council meeting agenda. The party was pushing for the motion to be heard urgently, claiming that the city is on the brink of a financial collapse under Mashaba. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has stuck to its programme and is on Wednesday dealing with other municipal issues on the agenda first and says a motion of no confidence against Mashaba and Da Gama will only be discussed on Thursday. Mashaba says the ANC is trying to control the city from the opposition benches. “If you want to control government, go and campaign and you become the government.” He says he’s going into Thursday’s motion against him and Da Gama undeterred. “The decision on whether I must be the executive mayor or not wasn’t mine. The decision was taken by 52% of the councillors.” The ANC wants Mashaba’s future to be discussed, claiming that under his leadership Johannesburg residences are receiving poor service delivery.
