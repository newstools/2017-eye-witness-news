He and his co-accused were found guilty of plotting and executing the school teacher's 2015 murder. Judge Daylin Chetty said: "On count four, the murder of Jayde, accused number one and accused number three are sentenced to imprisonment for life."  His co-accused Sinethemba Nemembe was handed a life sentence for his role in the murder. The third remaining co-accused, Zolani Sibeko, was sentenced to 15 years. Judge Chetty pulled no punches during his sentencing.  He said Panayiotou's expression of grief when Jayde's body was found was nothing more than "crocodile tears" and described the the crime as "abhorrent".  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
