                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says he is relooking certain policies that will support independent structures within his ministry to do their work effectively. He says these moves would enable them to deal with corruption within the SAPS. Mbalula was addressing the media in Tshwane on Friday, saying his priority would be the Hawks and Ipid, among others.Talking to the media against the backdrop of the release of the crime statistics, Mbalula says corruption within his ministry’s components is a priority. He says there is also a need to effectively coordinate and strengthen management within the SAPS amid the service functioning without a permanent commissioner. “We considered issues of management of the police in relation to how we need to effectively coordinate and strengthen our management.” Mbalula has also condemned what he calls the racialisation of farm murders, saying this defeats plans to fight the scourge. He has been meeting with MECs and private security agencies at the SAPS academy to map out a way forward to combat such crimes. Another issue discussed was farm murders, in which he says his ministry seeks to prioritise to deal with the issue as raised by farmers across the country.
