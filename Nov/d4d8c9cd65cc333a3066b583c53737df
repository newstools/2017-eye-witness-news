                                         DURBAN - The branch that Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma  belongs to has rejected her presidential ambitions and has instead thrown its support behind deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. The leadership from Ward 32 in eThekwini claims the regional executive sabotaged its efforts to hold its branch general meeting, meaning it subsequently missed the deadline set by Gwede Mantashe’s office. According to the African National Congress (ANC) nomination process, an official from the region must be deployed to branch meetings as part of their oversight duties. But this did not happen and the meeting was unable to go ahead. Ward 32 secretary Siya Njokweni says they wrote a letter to the eThekwini region last Thursday asking for an official to be deployed to their branch general meeting. Njokweni says there’s an attempt to stop their views being represented at the elective conference. “The leadership within the region knows that our branch is in support for comrade Cyril Ramaphosa towards the national conference of the ANC.” But provincial ANC spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli says the branch leadership in ward 32 has been disbanded and has no powers to convene meetings. Meanwhile, Secretary General Gwede Mantashe' s office has given another grace period in which branches can still meet over the coming weekend to nominate leadership
