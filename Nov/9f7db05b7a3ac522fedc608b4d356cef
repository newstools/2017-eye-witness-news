                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)  has failed to respond to a question on whether it will stay in the alliance if Cyril Ramaphosa loses at the African National Congress's elective conference next month, saying only that it will respect democratic processes. The labour federation has held a briefing on Thursday afternoon following its last central executive committee meeting for the year. Earlier this month, Cosatu’s Deputy General Secretary Solly Phetoe said: “The only person who would save the alliance is comrade Cyril Ramaphosa.” On Thursday, Cosatu was questioned on whether it will stay in the ANC-led alliance if Ramaphosa doesn’t win. The federation’s Sdumo Dlamini said: “We expect democratic processes in the ANC will yield the democratic outcomes which must bind all of us.” What the federation has made clear though is that the ANC in its current state, is no longer capable of uniting and spearheading the struggles of the masses of the people.
