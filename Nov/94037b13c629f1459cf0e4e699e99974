                                         JOHANNESBURG - Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs minister Des van Rooyen has been chased away from a voting station in Metsimaholo in the Free State. The minister was visiting stations in the area in his capacity as chairperson of the inter-ministerial committee on elections.  Eyewitness News received information that Van Rooyen was chased away from one of the local voting stations.However, when asked about this, he downplayed it. “I was there, the mood is vibrant. I was allowed in and received a briefing from the presiding officer. I’m happy with conduct of our people there.”  And then he changed his tune. “They were not happy, and the police had to correct that. Their argument is that the media shouldn’t interview me next to the [voting] station.” Van Rooyen has accused the Economic Freedom Fighters of being desperate to win votes by chasing him away.
