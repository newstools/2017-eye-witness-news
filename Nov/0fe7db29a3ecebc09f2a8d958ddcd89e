She was involved in the disastrous project in which 143 mentally ill patients died. Although throughout her testimony she blamed former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu and suspended HOD Doctor Barney Selebano for the deadly project, Manamela eventually conceded to supporting the termination of the contract with Life Esidimeni.
