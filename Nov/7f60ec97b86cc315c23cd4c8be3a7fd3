                                         CAPE TOWN - South Africans owe municipalities across the country a massive R128 billion and Treasury says a national culture of non-payment means this figure is likely to grow. Treasury officials have told Parliament’s Standing Committee on Appropriations that this means that some municipalities can’t pay their own bills to the tune of R43 billion. The more than R128 billion owed to municipalities is more than the R111 billion that local government gets as its share of the division of revenue. Households account for R83 billion of the debt, while businesses owe R27 billion. But government departments and entities are also responsible for municipal debt, owing more than R7 billion. Treasury’s Marijileng Ngqaleni said: “People that should be paying for water and electricity don’t pay.” Municipalities, in turn, owe creditors R43 billion: R16 billion to Eskom and nearly R7 billion for bulk water. Outstanding payments to suppliers amount to almost R12 billion, putting businesses at risk of going under. Ngqaleni says the underlying problem is political, rather than financial. “There is maladministration, malfunctioning, operational inefficiencies – (so) that even if you throw in money if you don’t address those issues, you won’t be able to find (a solution)."
