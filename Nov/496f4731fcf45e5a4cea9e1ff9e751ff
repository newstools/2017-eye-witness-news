                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma  and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa  will both be in Parliament to answer Members of Parliament (MPs) questions on Thursday afternoon. Zuma will face questions about his latest Cabinet reshuffle, among other things in his last question and answer session for the year in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). Ramaphosa will be answering questions in the National Assembly. He also faces a question relating to Zuma’s Cabinet changes. Opposition NCOP members want to know from President Zuma the reasons for his Cabinet reshuffle last month, and whether the performance of members of his Cabinet and deputy ministers plays any role in his decision to make changes. In his 12th Cabinet reshuffle last month, Zuma fired Blade Nzimande from his Higher Education and Training portfolio and made other changes just seven months after his earlier Cabinet shakeup in March. In the National Assembly, Ramaphosa’s been asked to say when Zuma told him about his decision to reshuffle. He’s also been asked whether Zuma has informed him that he does not intend to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture. Another question for Zuma in the NCOP is whether he intends making fresh representations to the National Prosecuting Authority before its month-end dealing on why charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering should not be brought against him.
