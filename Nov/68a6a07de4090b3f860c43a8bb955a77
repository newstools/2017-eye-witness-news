                                         PRETORIA - Justice Minister Michael Masutha has rejected suggestions that his handling of Chris Hani’s murderer Janusz Walus’s parole application was politically motivated.  The minister announced in Pretoria on Friday that he has declined the Polish national’s application - the second time in two years.  Walus was convicted together with former Conservative Party MP Clive Derby-Lewis of the 1993 assassination of Hani.  Masutha says that he dealt with Walus’s parole application like he does any other.  "In dealing with any matter, I look at what is brought before me and I try to make rational sense of it and that informs the decision that I make." A psychological report found that Walus’s political ideology remains a risk factor, as his views about communism have not changed.  Walus justifies murdering Hani because he was a communist.
