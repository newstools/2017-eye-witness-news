                                         JOHANNESBURG - Private investigator Paul O' Sullivan says anyone with information on the recent killings in and around Marikana should come forward. WATCH: Before we die: Marikana miners speak out  O'Sullivan was hired by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) following the deaths of at least 10 of its leaders on the platinum belt. Four men who have gone into hiding say challenging the union's leadership landed them on an alleged hitlist. O’Sullivan says that until evidence has been brought forward, the allegations are all hearsay. “We have also set up a toll-free number which is 0800 118 118. Anyone with any information whatsoever, regardless of who they think it might be, are welcome to call that number. There’s a R100,000 reward being issued.” O'Sullivan says the those with information who wish to remain anonymous will be protected. Meanwhile, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says those who face allegations of murder on the platinum belt will be fully investigated. Mbalula was speaking after an Eyewitness News exclusive revealed how some miners are living in fear following hits that have left at least 10 local leaders dead in the last five years. Some of the miners have accused the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) president Joseph Mathunjwa and others in the senior leadership of creating an environment that has enabled the murders. Mbalula says that no one is above the law and that the truth about who is behind the recent murders will soon come to light. “For anyone who is implicated by the allegations, there will be no stone left unturned.” Mbalula says he has reached out to relevant stakeholders, including Amcu, to try and defuse tensions and restore law and order.
