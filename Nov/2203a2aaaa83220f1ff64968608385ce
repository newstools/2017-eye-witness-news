                                         JOHANNESBURG - Parliament says its joint committee on ethics is considering an affidavit which is believed to involve State Security Minister Bongani Bongo, but it cannot give any details. The Sunday Times reported that Bongo has been accused of offering a bribe to the evidence leader of Parliament's state capture inquiry advocate Ntuthuzelo Vanara. The paper says that a bribe was offered to Vanara to step down as a way to frustrate the inquiry. It’s reported that Bongo offered Vanara a bribe in the form of a blank cheque. It’s understood Vanara submitted an affidavit with the allegations to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, who reported the matter to Parliament’s ethics committee. While Parliament has not named the parties involved, it has confirmed the affidavit is being considered by the committee. Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the committee will deal with the matter. “It’s the responsibility of the committee to initiate a proper process once it has received a report.” Parliament has not given an indication on when the matter will be tabled. However, the committee is set to meet with Vanara on Tuesday. Earlier this month it emerged that Bongo was under investigation by the Hawks over alleged criminal activity from his time as head of criminal services at the Mpumalanga Human Settlements Department in 2012.
