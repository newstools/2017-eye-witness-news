                                         JOHANNESBURG â€“ South African Revenue Service (Sars) executive Jonas Makwakwa  may still need to answer for suspicious transactions amounting to over R1 million. Law firm Hogan Lovells has placed on record that while it investigated allegations of misconduct, it did not directly investigate the transactions into his account identified by the Financial Intelligence Centre. Sars announced that Makwakwa was cleared of all charges and returned to work on the first of the month, after being placed on suspension for almost a year. It's unclear if Makwakwa will face any further charges relating to the suspicious transactions. When it was discovered that Makwakwa made cash deposits into his bank accounts amounting to R1.3 million, Lovells was appointed to conduct an independent investigation. But the law firm has now confirmed that its scope was limited to whether there was misconduct by Makwakwa.  It did not seek to directly investigate the transactions identified by the Financial Intelligence Centre, saying it understands that all criminal-related allegations were referred to the relevant authorities for investigation.
