                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has slammed people who criticise South Africa, saying they are only hurting the country. Zuma is addressing the National Council of Provinces for the last time this year. He says the country is being steered in the right direction out of a technical recession. “Attacking South Africa and badmouthing the country when she is most vulnerable is irresponsible, especially if done by South Africans themselves.” President Zuma says government has noted that many among what he calls the privileged classes become angry when government speaks about the legacy of apartheid, saying these people want it to be simply forgotten. He says apartheid has damaged the country and this needs to be corrected. “It is incorrect that the income level of a white household remains six times higher than that of a black household.” WATCH LIVE: Zuma addresses NCOP  Zuma makes this address against the backdrop of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba painting a dire state of the economy in his medium-term budget statement last month. Zuma is speaking to representatives from the provinces under the theme ‘Deepening unity in action for inclusive growth and Africa’s renewal - Reclaiming the legacy of OR Tambo’. Zuma’s speech will be debated by members afterwards. Last week, the president faced some tough questions in the National Assembly during the last question and answer session for the year, including whether he received illegal payments from a businessman after becoming president. He’s also under increasing pressure from Parliament’s Higher Education committee and the public, to release the Fees Commission report into the feasibility of providing free tertiary education.
