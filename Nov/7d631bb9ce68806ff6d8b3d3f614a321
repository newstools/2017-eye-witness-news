                                         NEW YORK - A-list stars like Anne Hathaway, Ewan McGregor and Trevor Noah will come together on Monday night to perform stories written by children in South Africa at New York's Carnegie Hall. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Danny Boyle The Children's Monologues will be performed to benefit Dramatic Need - a charity that uses the arts to uplift children in South Africa and Rwanda. The New York production will take place on Monday evening just after an all-women South African version of the production is staged in Johannesburg. It'll blend musical performances, dance and dramatic interpretations of monologues by the likes of Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Susan Sarandon and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The Childrenâ€™s Monologues presents performances based on the stories of children growing up in Rammulotsi in the Free State. Children there were invited to describe a day they would never forget, which award-winning playwrights then adapted for the stage.
