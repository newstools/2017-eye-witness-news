                                         JOHANNESBURG - The President's Keepers author, Jacques Pauw, says that his lawyers are currently in contact with KwaZulu-Natal authorities to establish why a criminal case was opened against him in that province. It has emerged that the police in KZN have tried to secure a warrant for his arrest, which was rejected by the Pietermaritzburg magistrate's court this week. Pauw says that the case was opened by Roy Moodley, who's mentioned in his book as President Jacob Zuma's public friend and an ANC benefactor. He says that some of the charges opened against him include fraud and violations of the Tax Administration Act. "I don't know how many cases are being investigated where. I was quite surprised that there was one in Pietermaritzburg as well, which I know nothing about."
