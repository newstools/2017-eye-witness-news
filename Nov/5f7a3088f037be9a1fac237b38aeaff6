                                         CAPE TOWN - Two suspects are expected to appear in court on Monday for the murder of Brian Wainstein.  Two brothers aged 27 and 31 have been arrested in connection with murder of the alleged steroids dealer, who was shot dead in his Constantia home on 18 August, 2017.  The Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Unit arrested the two brothers over the weekend. Police say that at the time of the murder, Wainstein’s wife explained that her husband had received a visit earlier that evening by two men who requested to speak to her husband.  Later that evening, she heard shots fired and discovered that her husband had been killed. Fabian Cupido, who was arrested on October 10 for his alleged involvement in the murder, remains in custody and is expected back in court on 29 November.
