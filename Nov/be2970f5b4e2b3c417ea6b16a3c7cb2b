                                         CAPE TOWN - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has welcomed the life sentence handed down to convicted wife killer Christopher Panayiotou. The sentence was delivered in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Friday. Panayiotou's co-accused Sinethemba Nenembe was also handed a life sentence for the murder of Jayde Panayiotou, while Zolani Sibeko received 15 years on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder. The businessman hired the men to kill his spouse in April 2015. Jayde was shot dead on the outskirts of Uitenhage, shortly after she was kidnapped from outside her home.Emotions ran high after Judge Dayalin Chetty handed down sentencing. Chetty was clear: the actions of Panayiotou and his co-accused deserved heavy punishment. He found Panayiotou has taken no responsibility for his actions since the start of the trial. The NPA's Tshepho Ndwalaza agrees with the court's findings. “It’s a very good sentence and we’re satisfied with it. We believe the family of Jayde got justice, finally.” Panayiotou’s defence counsel has indicated it will seek leave to appeal his murder conviction. The application has been set down for 13 December.
