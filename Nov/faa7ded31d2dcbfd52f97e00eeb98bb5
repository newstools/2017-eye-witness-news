                                         JOHANNESBURG- Former Springbok centre Hennie le Roux believes that the Springboks still lack tactical awareness, and will struggle to beat Wales in Cardiff on Saturday.  Speaking to EWN Sport, Le Roux says that he is still searching for answers from the Springboks and beliefs that they are still tactically fragile.  “The game might be close but there is nothing that gives me confidence that we can take on the Welsh and be confident and beat them.”  The Springboks go into the game against Wales on the back of two consecutive victories against France and Italy on the end of year tour. Le Roux though doesn’t believe that recent victories guarantee a win over the Welsh.  “I haven’t seen any improvement since the game against Ireland, and the victories against France and Italy don’t give me enough confidence against Wales.”  Le Roux also says that the game against Wales will provide the Springboks with some direction, and will be a test on where they are.  “If we lose it will be an indication of where I see South African rugby now and I say this with the intent that things will change, we need to have the right guidance into the right direction and right now we are lacking.”  The match at the Principality stadium will be South Africa’s last test of the year. Kick-off in Cardiff is at 16h30.
