                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe's former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa has told thousands of supporters that Wednesday is the beginning of a new unfolding democracy. He's commended the manner in which the defence forces carried out the takeover of Zimbabwe that ultimately lead to Robert Mugabe's resignation. Mnangagwa has taken over from Mugabe who has been at the helm of the country for close to four decades. In his first address since taking over, Mnangagwa pledged himself as a servant of the people. “You have heard of a letter which I sent to his Excellency, saying, President Mugabe, the people have spoken. You said if the people said I must step down, you shall comply; this is the day to comply.” The man known as "The Crocodile" has also told the crowd that he's kept in constant communication with the security chiefs throughout. “I feel so humbled that we have remained here until this hour at our headquarters, waiting for me. Now you see me and I see you.” He praised the nation for remaining calm throughout the transition of power. “In my discussions with some heads of states, they hailed the discipline and the peacefulness of the people of Zimbabwe.” He says President Jacob Zuma has told him that SADC is proud of the manner in which this change was achieved. He was introduced by the Zanu-PF’s Obert Mpofu, who was drowned out by cheers when he mentioned Mnangagwa's name. Mnangagwa was flanked by his bodyguards. WATCH: Mnangagwa address
