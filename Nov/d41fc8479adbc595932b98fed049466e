                                         JOHANNESBURG - Sibanye-Stillwater says a three-year wage agreement signed with three unions will save jobs at its Kroonstad operation. The company signed the agreement with Solidarity, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu).  Workers will receive inflation-related increases. Spokesperson James Wellstead says this deal is a positive move. “I think it’s quite positive given the volatile history of labour negotiations in the sector in recent years and given the fact that we’re trying to secure the lives of these operations and jobs, that’s exactly how we should go about it.”
