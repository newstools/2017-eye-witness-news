                                         ABIDJAN - Anti-poverty organisation Oxfam says the AU-EU Summit needs to take responsibility for African migrants being traded as slaves in Libya. The organisation spoke to Eyewitness News at the two-day gathering currently underway in Abidjan. More than 80 countries are represented at the fifth gathering of African and European leaders. The swanky, historic Hotel Ivoire is abuzz with delegates from the African continent and across the Mediterranean. Migration is high on the agenda, but Oxfam’s Imma de Miguel says despite recent reports of slavery, it’s nothing new. “Europe knows, the African governments know already about the conditions of these immigrants and the slavery conditions…. a very non-respect of human rights and I think this summit needs to take responsibility.” De Miguel says migration is not a problem, but rather finding opportunities and benefits for people in the countries they come from and where they’re headed. President Jacob Zuma is expected to comment on the matter in a closed-door session on Wednesday afternoon.   (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
