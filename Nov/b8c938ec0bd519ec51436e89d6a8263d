                                         JOHANNESBURG - There are concerns that new efforts to relocate funds for free higher education could see less potential black professors being subsidized. The organisation that co-ordinates scholarships research, the National Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences (NIHSS) may see its budget cut by R35 million. The City Press says it’s in possession of a letter addressed to the CEO of the NIHSS informing it about the budget cut. President Jacob Zuma is yet to release the much-awaited fees commission report. There are concerns that if the president cuts the NIHSS budget it will hamper transformation at universities. It’s being reported that if Zuma cuts the NIHSS' budget by R35 million this will limit addressing the skewed demographics at universities where more than 80% of professors are white. The City Press is reporting that NIHSS head Sarah Mosoetsa has confirmed the budget has already been cut. The institution was established four years ago to increase the number of black PHD students. It has funded 400 PHD students in three years.
