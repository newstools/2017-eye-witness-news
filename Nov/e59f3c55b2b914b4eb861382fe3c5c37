                                         PARYS - The Free State African National Congress (ANC) general council, which nominated Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma for president, is now under question following Wednesday’s Bloemfontein High Court ruling declaring it null and void. The council was held on Tuesday and the Free State became the first province to officially nominate Dlamini Zuma. However, the High Court has now ruled that branch meetings held in four regions breached the ANC Constitution, meaning the elective conference scheduled for this weekend can no longer go ahead. The court has ruled that decisions, resolutions and outcomes of the branch general meetings held in 21 wards over the last four months were unlawful and unconstitutional. Among those decisions is the nomination of Dlamini Zuma and the selection of delegates. Free State ANC spokesperson Thabo Meeko said: “As far as we’re concerned, the court did not have any implications towards the PGC [provincial general council].” But the court made it clear that until the branch general meetings sit again properly this time, any gathering that delegates and their representatives attend would be unlawful, including the provincial elective conference which was planned for this weekend.
