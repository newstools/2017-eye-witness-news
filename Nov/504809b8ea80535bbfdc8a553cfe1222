                                         JOHANNESBURG - Human rights organisation Section 27 has confirmed it will be taking the government to court on behalf of the family of six-year-old Michael Komape who died after falling into a pit toilet Limpopo. Komape died four years ago at a school toilet in Chebeng outside Polokwane. The organisation has cited the Basic Education Minister, Limpopo Education MEC and the Mahlodumela Primary School principal. Section 27 says government has not apologised to Komape’s family following his death in 2014. The organisation says the Basic Education Department violated the rights of pupils, particularly Komape. Spokesperson Bhavma Ramji says they intend to argue that the department not only owes the victim’s family, but a broader sanitation programme is needed in Limpopo to benefit pupils at rural schools. “Their negligent conduct and their violation of Michael and his family’s constitutional rights were wrongful and as a result, they owe not only damages to the family, but a broader sanitation programme.” The case is set down for three weeks beginning next Monday in the Polokwane High Court.
