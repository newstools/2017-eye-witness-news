                                         CAPE TOWN - Residents from an informal settlement outside Stellenbosch have ceased protesting for now. Earlier on Friday morning, Stellenbosch Arterial and Polkadraai roads opposite Vlottenburg were closed when protesters burnt tyres and other debris. The roads have since been opened. Jamestown Neighbourhood Watch's Vivian van der Merwe says residents from an informal settlement in the Longlands area are upset. “Endless delays in getting temporary accommodation from the municipality... There’s also an issue about farm property on which there are people who were on farmland which was sold and its understood that they were made promises by the property owners about accommodation which have not come to fruition.”
