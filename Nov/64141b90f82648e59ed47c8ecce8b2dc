                                         CAPE TOWN - The Garden Route National Park says that it's been able to resume most activities in the section worst-affected by the devastating Knysna fires. In June, fires ripped through parts of the Southern Cape, burning vegetation and gutting several buildings in Knysna and Plettenberg Bay. The park's Nandi Mgwadlamba says that officials have managed to restore all cycling trails and hiking trails. "Regarding the Harkerville multi-day trail, we are still working on it. There some areas that are open and peole can go and hike. We've also erected signage everywhere which ones (trails) are open and which are not open."
