                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan says he hopes that the delegates at the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference will see that the country must walk a path to recovery, as up to now there’s been a tragedy unfolding. Speaking to Eyewitness News, Gordhan said many called to answer to accusations of state capture had not accounted for their actions.  He says if Moody’s downgrades the country to sub-investment grade, it could take up to 10 years to recover. Gordhan says that democracy cannot be refashioned to benefit some and state capture is still a major problem. He was asked about Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and whether there had been accountability at the parliamentary inquiry. "Both at her level but also beyond that in terms of CEOs, boards, etc, we actually see a tragedy unfolding in South Africa." Gordhan says all of those involved in state capture need to be exposed. "Deal with the storm troopers of the corrupt who will constantly attack those who are trying to do the right things and an example of this will be the way MPs have been intimidated or offered bribes." He says business leaders need to continue to stand up against what has gone wrong in the country. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
