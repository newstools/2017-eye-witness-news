                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board says it intends to improve its digital technology as well as expanding ways to create revenue. The board was well received on Friday at a public hearing with Parliament’s portfolio committee on communication.  Chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini says they have been able to implement the recommendations prescribed by the Public Protector’s 2014 report, which found major irregularities and mismanagement at the broadcaster.  Makhathini says the board has a lot of work to do. “The SABC and broadcasting at large is a complex industry. We do need to have people from different fields to help us, like today we said we have two vacancies and we don’t have a chartered accountant on our board.”  Chairperson of the committee Humphrey Maxegwana adds they’re pleased with the board’s progress. “We find those men and women showing some unity and they’re very willing to work together.” Maxegwana says it’s possible to rescue the SABC. “We are trying to do his on behalf of South Africa and South Africans who work at the SABC, like journalists, so that we can have a happy workforce.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
