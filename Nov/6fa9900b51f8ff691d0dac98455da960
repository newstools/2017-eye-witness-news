                                         JOHANNESBURG - Nelson Mandela Mayor Athol Trollip has survived a motion of no confidence. Reports say Trollip received 65 votes against the motion, with 54 votes against him. The motion was proposed by Patriotic Alliance Provincial leader Marlon Daniels and seconded by the UDM's Mongameli Bobani. Bobani says Mayor Trollip is not taking charge amid mounting problems in the metro. He adds the issue of water cuts in communities remains a big concern for the citizens of Nelson Mandela Bay. Trollip and Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba have both faced motions against them on Thursday. There is still no result for the Johannesburg vote.
