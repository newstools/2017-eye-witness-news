                                         JOHANNESBURG - While President Jacob Zuma has denied the existence of state capture, some of his colleagues in the African National Congress (ANC) say they are not surprised by the denial because he is implicated. Earlier this week, the president described state capture as a fake political tool created to paint a particular family and some individuals in a bad light. Former deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas, who was one of the first people to lift the lid on state capture, says that those denying state capture are being disingenuous. “It depends on where you stand. Whether you’re a beneficiary or not, that’s the simple thing.” NEC member Pravin Gordhan says that denial is an inadequate response. “They have to deny it because they’re probably implicated in it and denial is the best form.” On Thursday, Gordhan said there are people who will be arrested after the ANC’s elective conference in December.
