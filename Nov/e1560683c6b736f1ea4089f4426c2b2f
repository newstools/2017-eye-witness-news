                                         JOHANNESBURG - Harmony Gold has confirmed the strike at its Kusasalethu Mine is officially over. Production at the mine was brought to a halt when workers went on a wildcat strike over the dismissal of six Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) branch leaders. On Monday, the gold producer was granted an interdict by the Labour Court while the union held a mass meeting with disgruntled employees. An agreement was reached with workers reporting to work on Monday night. Harmony Gold’s Lauren Fourie said: “The Labour Court granted us an interdict and subsequent to that Amcu had a mass meeting with employees and concluded that employees should return to work. I can also confirm that the strike is now over, and employees reported to work on Monday night for the late shift.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
