                                         JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune’s luck has not been on his side in recent times, and could be in doubt for Chiefs' clash with AmaZulu due to an allergic reaction to prawns. Khune posted a picture of his face, with swollen lips after he ate prawns during the weekend.   The shot stopper has had his fair share of injuries recently - he fractured a bone in his face in the Telkom Knockout and had to play the World Cup qualifier against Senegal at the Peter Mokaba Stadium with a face mask. Social media also responded to Khune’s latest misfortune.
