                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town city manager Achmat Ebrahim says that it is "extremely improbable" that he would commit misconduct in the twilight of his career. He’s facing precautionary suspension after allegations levelled against him by the executive director in the mayor’s office, Craig Kesson.  But Ebrahim says suspending him would impact on the stability of the city and raise serious questions about its governance.  Achmat Ebrahim has been Cape Town’s city manager for more than a decade and has served in local government for almost 40 years.  He’s never been charged with any form of impropriety. Ebrahim has declined to comment personally on the allegations against him, including that he’s failed to act on losses of more than R40 million in the MyCiti fare system.  But in a report that’s been presented to council, Ebrahim says it’s premature to quantify the exact losses, and that a forensic report is still outstanding. Ebrahim has also defended his handling of alleged tender irregularities in the Foreshore Freeway Project, saying that he reconstituted the bid evaluation committee after concerns were raised by an independent body. He says that no direct allegation of misconduct was made against Transport Commissioner Melissa Whitehead, who is also facing suspension.
