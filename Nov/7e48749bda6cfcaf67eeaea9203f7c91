                                         JOHANNESBURG - Management at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital has denied claims that ceiling leakages at the hospital are getting worse, saying they have a team of engineers dedicated to the pipes on site. Democratic Alliance's Gauteng shadow health MEC Jack Bloom claims leaks are still a major concern and its structural integrity is still questionable. Bloom conducted a walkabout at the hospital last week. Five people were injured when the roof of the hospital collapsed in March this year. The hospital's spokesperson Lungiswa Mvumvu says they are attending to the leaks. “The leak was from a central sitting pipe and it was attended to within an hour. So, the water keeps on dripping into other areas, that’s residual water trapped in the interior floors. Otherwise, that one has been sorted out and I’m not aware of any other leaks.”
