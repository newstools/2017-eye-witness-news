                                         JOHANNESBURG - Harmony Gold has on Monday approached the Labour Court for an urgent interdict to end a wildcat strike over the dismissal of Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) branch leaders at its Kusasalethu mine. The strike started on Friday with reports of violence and allegations of intimidation of rival union members. Harmony Gold says negotiations with Amcu were unsuccessful as employees have still not heeded calls to return to work. The mining company's Marian van der Walt says: “We had issued an ultimatum to employees to return to work, that was issued on Friday. Unfortunately, only a small amount of people arrived at the mine last night and this morning.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
