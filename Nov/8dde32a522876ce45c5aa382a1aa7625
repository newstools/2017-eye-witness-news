                                         JOHANNESBURG - Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is set to visit Uganda, again, defying the international arrest warrant over alleged genocide charges. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni’s press secretary said the Sudanese leader will arrive in the country on Sunday, not giving further details regarding the visit.  A source at the foreign affairs ministry said President Bashir’s visit is part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict in South Sudan. In 2016, Justice Minister Michael Masutha announced that South Africa was pulling out of the Rome Statute arguing that the move is aimed at strengthening its ability to resolve conflict on the continent. The announcement came after the court of appeal concluded that the government violated its international and domestic legal obligations in not arresting ICC fugitive Al-Bashir in June 2015 when he visited the country.
