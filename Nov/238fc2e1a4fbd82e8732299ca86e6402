                                         PRETORIA - The State has argued that Oscar Pistorius has not shown remorse for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp and that he should be punished accordingly.  The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has asked the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) to set aside his six-year jail term and impose the minimum 15 years imprisonment for murder.  Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day in 2013.  State prosecutor Andrea Johnson has argued that the High Court misdirected itself by elevating Pistorius’s regret to remorse. "And that is what I mean, Justice Bosielo, that this is where the court erred. She elevated his regret. And one cannot say that his regret absolves him of the crime."

Johnson says that genuine remorse requires a full appreciation of the extent of one’s actions, which she says the former athlete has not shown. The prosecutor referred to the SCA’s earlier finding that Pistorius’s version of events was contradictory. Johnson says that he still has not provided a proper explanation for why he fired the shots.
