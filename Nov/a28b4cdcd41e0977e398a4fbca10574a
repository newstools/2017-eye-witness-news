                                         JOHANNESBURG - India and Sri Lanka played out to a draw on the final day of the rain-affected first Test match at iconic Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Monday. In seamer-friendly conditions the visiting Sri Lankans dismissed India for a modest 172 first innings total, with Suranga Lakmal the chief destroyer taking 4 for 26 in 19 overs. Cheteswar Pujara provided the only resistance, with a defiant knock of 52. Sri Lankaâ€™s first innings reply stuttered and struggled to gain any sort of momentum, eventually being all out for 294, with a slender lead of 122. Much of the first two days of the match were stop-start affairs due to consistent rain in Kolkata. In their second innings the hosts piled on the runs at a brisk pace, seemingly in an effort to force a positive result. India captain Virat Kohli smashed a quickfire 104 not out off 119 deliveries, in the process recording his 50th international century. India eventually declared their second innings on 352 for 8, setting Sri Lanka a target of 231 runs for victory in the last session of the match. The Sri Lankan batsmen were immediately under pressure, with man of the match Bhuvneshwar Kumar ripping through the top order, finishing with match figures of 8 for 96. The match finished with Sri Lanka reeling on 78 for 7 when bad light forced the two captains to shake hands for a draw. The second Test gets underway in Nagpur on Friday.
