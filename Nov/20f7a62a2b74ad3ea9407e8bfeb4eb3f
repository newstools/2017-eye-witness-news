                                         DURBAN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Moses Mabhida region in KwaZulu-Natal says it does not want to speculate about possible reasons being behind the murders of two of its members this week. On Thursday morning, Youth League leader Sthembiso Mhlongo was gunned down in his Howick home by unknown suspects. Mhlongo was on Monday at the scene of another murder of ANC activist Lungisani Mnguni who was shot and killed while conducting business in the area. Moses Mabhida Regional Secretary Mzi Khumalo said: “This is criminal work. And law enforcement agencies really need to do their bit.”
