                                         CAPE TOWN - City bosses and Cape Minstrel Carnival organisers are heading for another showdown asthe Cape Town Minstrel Carnival Association's is fuming after the City of Cape Town denied its application for funding.  The matter will likely land up in court. The association's Kevin Momberg says: “The other issue is also the unfair decision by the city to not give us money or consider us for the street parades. They rejected our application.” In August, the city approved just over R6 million in funding for minstrel events for this year's festive season. Requests for the funding were received through the city’s event support application system and considered by the special events committee. This is the first year that the city finalised the allocation of funding months ahead of the minstrel and choir events. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
