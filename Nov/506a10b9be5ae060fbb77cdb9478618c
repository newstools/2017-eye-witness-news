                                         JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune is a major doubt for the World Cup qualifiers against Senegal on 10 November at the Peter Mokaba Stadium and the return fixture four days later at the Stade Leopold Sedar Senghor in Dakar.  Khune fractured his cheek bone in Sundayâ€™s 1-0 Telkom Knockout victory over Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.  He underwent further scans on Monday to determine the extent of the injury but could be out for a period of between two to six weeks. The Glamour Boys progressed to the TKO semi-finals thanks to a Bernard Parker penalty that sets up a final four clash with Wits after the Clever Boys beat league leaders Baroka FC 1-0 on Saturday night.  The other semi will see Polokwane City battle Bloemfontein Celtic. The matches will be played on the weekend of 18-19 November with times and venues set to be confirmed by the Absa Premier Soccer League.
