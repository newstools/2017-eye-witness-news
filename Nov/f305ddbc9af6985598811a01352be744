                                         HARARE - In what could prove to be a landmark case, a Zimbabwean woman has gone to the highest court in the land to challenge the payment of bride price. The woman wants the Harare Constitutional Court to rule that paying the bride price, or lobola, is discriminatory and reduces women to mere assets. This is a challenge to a cultural practice that’s been in place for centuries. Harare lawyer Priccilar Vengesai wants the nine-member Constitutional Court to deal with the matter. Vengesai says her previous experience of a bride payment, or lobola, had left her demoralised and subject to her ex-husband’s control. In court documents cited by the state-run Herald, she says the practice has no place in a modern industrialised society. There’s been a mixed reaction on Thursday to news of this court challenge; some observers doubt whether the court will make a ruling on the constitutionality of cultural norms.
