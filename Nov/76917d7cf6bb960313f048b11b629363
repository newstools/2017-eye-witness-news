CRL Rights Commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva says government can no longer turn its back on teenagers who need penile transplants after being mutilated at initiation schools. JOHANNESBURG - Cultural and religious watchdog the CRL Rights Commission has recommended that the Health Department subsidise penile transplants for teenagers who've suffered botched circumcisions at initiation schools. The commission has released its findings after investigating the deaths, abductions and violence associated with the initiation process in South Africa. CRL Rights Commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva says government can no longer turn its back on teenagers who need penile transplants after being mutilated at initiation schools. “Government pays for heart transplants, kidney transplants, the Department of Health needs to deal with this issue. This is about saving lives.” Mkhwanazi-Xaluva says the absence of transitional leaders overseeing the process is one of the main contributing factors to the crisis in the cultural practice. She says police need to act faster and harsher against those responsible for illegal initiation schools.
