                                         JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mines (NUM) and Congress of South African Trade Unions will on Monday march on the offices of metal mining group Sibanye-Stillwater in Westonaria after the company sent forced retrenchment termination letters to over 2,000 workers. Sibanye last week said it had to retrench the workers at its Cooke gold operations because it had been experiencing difficulties for some time and accumulated losses.  NUM’s Livhuwani Mamburu claims that the company has hired over 800 security officials to guard the operation after laying off the workers. He says this shows that the mine never had the interest of workers at heart. “Our members are not happy because during consultation, we came up with so many proposals to avert retrenchments. The company did not want to consider them.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
