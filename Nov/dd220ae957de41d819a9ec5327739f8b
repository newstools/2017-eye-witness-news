                                         CAPE TOWN - Some Cape Town residents have been protesting against exhumations at the Black River Cemetery this week.  Demonstrators at the site say St Mark’s Anglican church, which maintains the cemetery, is moving remains to another location.  Community leader reverend Greg Fick says the remains are being kept at the Constantia Morgue. “What the church is saying is that the graveyard is not in use anymore. There was no boundary wall, so people used to walk freely through the cemetery turning it to an open field.” Reverend Fick wants authorities to intervene and to help re-bury the remains at the cemetery. Community members are planning to march on Sunday. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
