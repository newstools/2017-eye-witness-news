                                         PARLIAMENT - Business rescuer Piers Marsden says he walked into a hornet’s nest at Eskom when he tried to save Glencore’s Optimum coal mine from going under. Marsden has on Wednesday told Parliament’s inquiry into state capture that former Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe took a hard stance against Glencore when he was appointed in 2015. Marsden says Eskom’s insistence that Optimum pay an R2 billion fine for coal already used led to its bankruptcy, adding that the utility seemed reluctant to help save the mine. Marsden says at the time, Eskom’s hard line against the Optimum coal mine, appeared to make business sense. “I think where the picture starts to become a little bit murkier, is the facts that have come out post the event.” He says attempts to spare the mine through negotiations with Eskom proved futile. “It became apparent to us and quite clear that a transaction that involved a simple reshuffling of the contract with Glencore as a shareholder was unlikely to meet the approval of Eskom.” The fine for the substandard coal was reduced to only around R600 million after Tegeta bought the mine. Marsden says in fairness, R2 billion seemed the more appropriate amount. WATCH: Parly committee questions Eskom's corporate governance  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
