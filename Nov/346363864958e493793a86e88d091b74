                                         JOHANNESBURG - Tighthead prop Thomas du Toit has been called up to the Springbok squad as cover for the injured Tendai Mtawarira ahead of the final test of the year against Wales on Saturday.  Mtawarira hurt his groin in the Springboks 35-6 victory over Italy in Padova on Saturday. The versatile du Toit, who can play both tighthead and loosehead, will arrive in Wales on Monday.  The veteran Mtawarira will be afforded the maximum amount of time to recover from his injury before a decision is made on his availability.  The Springboks will be without their overseas-based players for the clash against Wales as the match falls outside of the test window.  Kick-off at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff is at 16h30.
