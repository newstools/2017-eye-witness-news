                                         LADYSMITH - The KwaZulu-Natal Education Department has visited two schools in Ladysmith that have lost teachers in a crash caused by Tuesday’s dramatic shooting. A vehicle transporting a Klipriver Association taxi boss, his daughter, two bodyguards and a driver was ambushed by unknown gunmen. The car they were travelling in then ploughed into another mini-bus that was ferrying local school teachers and others. A total of 11 people were killed. KZN education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane described the mood as tense after visiting teachers at Masoyi Secondary School and Matiwane Primary. “As we visited Matiwane Primary School on Wednesday morning, the situation was very tense we even had an incident of one teacher collapsing whom we have to take to one of the local clinics.” Dlungwane says the department has never experienced the loss of so many teachers at one time. Meanwhile, examinations are continuing at both schools.
