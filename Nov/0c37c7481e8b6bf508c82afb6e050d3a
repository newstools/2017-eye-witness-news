                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Sunday Times has denied claims that its journalist Mzilikazi wa Afrika received a bag of money worth millions which allegedly links private sector corruption with Eskom bosses and the media. A document making the claim was circulated by Eskom’s suspended interim group chief executive Matshela Koko’s legal team at his disciplinary hearing on Thursday. It’s not yet clear if this will be submitted as evidence. The allegations are contained in an affidavit made at a police station by former chief of security at Makheda Protection Services, Ntokozo Dubazana. This company provided security for former Eskom contract manager France Hlakudi. The Sunday Times' editor Bongani Siqoko says the allegations against Wa Afrika are false. “Mzilikazi denies ever meeting the guy. We stand by our reporter, there’s absolutely no proof at all that money exchanged hands and money was given to Mzilikazi.”
