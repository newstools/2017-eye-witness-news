                                         CAPE TOWN - Two former Trillian  employees have now explained how the company used connections with key figures at some state-owned enterprises and Minister Des van Rooyen’s department to score deals. Trillian Capital Partners was once controlled by Gupta ally Salim Essa; it’s believed to be one of the companies used to milk the state. Its dealings have come under scrutiny during the Public Enterprises Portfolio committee’s probe into allegations of state capture where the second whistleblower testified on Friday. The focus on Trillian began on Tuesday when Mosilo Mothepu, a former CEO of Trillian Financial Advisory, was called to testify in the parliamentary inquiry. She claimed Eskom  CFO Anoj Singh helped Trillian score deals by sharing inside information on a “memory stick.” Eskom paid Trillian nearly R600 million for advisory services without any signed contracts in place. Mothepu believes the state-owned enterprise did not get value for money. The spotlight turned to Trillian’s management consulting arm three days later when whistle-blower Bianca Goodson gave testimony. Goodson told lawmakers that her subsidiary staffed by just two employees billed Eskom R30.6 million without seemingly doing any work. “When I saw the invoice for R30.6 million, I didn’t know what it was for.” Goodson said the consultancy made money by introducing international firms to state-owned enterprises.
