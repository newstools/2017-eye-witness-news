                                         HARARE - Eyewitness News understands that cabinet ministers in Zimbabwe have failed to show up for a meeting with President Robert Mugabe.  The ministers were expected to attend the regular Tuesday meeting which would've been the first since the military take over last week.  WATCH: Mugabe sacked from Zanu-PF, but no resignation  Instead they attended a Zanu-PF meeting at the ruling party's headquarters to discuss Tuesday's impeachment proceedings.  Mugabe was sacked as party leader on Sunday and replaced him with sacked vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa.  Mnangagwa issued a statement on Tuesday morning, saying he would not return to Harare to meet Mugabe and warned the elderly statesman to step down or be forced out.  Mnangagwa will not be landing in Harare anytime soon despite military claims that he would do so. Mnangagwa says he was called to return home by Mugabe, but has refused to do so until heâ€™s satisfied with his security. He fled the country after Mugabe sacked him, in a move that was largely expected to pave the way for first lady Grace Mugabe to become leader of the country. The ousted leader has added his voice to those who have demanded the 93-year-old statesman resign. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
