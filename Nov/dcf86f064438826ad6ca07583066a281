                                         CAPE TOWN - The South African Weather Service says that extremely cold weather in the Northern Cape, Free State and in Beaufort West is rare, but not impossible for this time of the year. These are some of the areas that have been hardest hit by the drought. An unexpected cold front hit these regions this week, with snow even falling in Beaufort West.  The Gamka Dam in this Karoo town has run dry but 80% of its water supply comes from boreholes. Weather forecaster Vanetia Phakula says these seemingly strange weather patterns are due to the cut-off flow pressure system. "It's not unusual. It has happened in the past. It depends on the cut-off flow. So this one was strong enough to let the temperatures drop to a point that we have snowfalls over the high-lying areas."
