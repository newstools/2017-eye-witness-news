                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has called on all members of the African National Congress-led alliance to respect the partnership, saying the organisations need each other. Zuma was addressing supporters in Kagiso on the West Rand. ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe recently said the alliance between the ANC, the South African Communist Party (SACP), Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) is at its lowest. Cosatu and the SACP have upped the ante by calling for President Zuma to step down, saying they have lost all confidence in him. This has since worsened the relationship between the organizations. President Zuma, who has previously criticised the SACP for focusing too much attention on the ANC, has spoken about the need for the alliance partners to stick together, saying the organisations need each other to advance South Africans. On Friday, Cosatu said the only thing that could save the alliance is Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa being elected president in December. WATCH: President Zuma delivers OR Tambo lecture
