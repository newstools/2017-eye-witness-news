                                         JOHANNESBURG - Ratings firm Fitch  kept both South Africa's local and foreign currency credit ratings unchanged at BB+, one notch below investment grade, with a stable outlook, the agency said on Thursday. "The affirmation reflects that while a number of developments point to a weaker fiscal outlook and consequent faster pace of debt accumulation, potential fiscal consolidation measures after the African National Congress's elective conference in December could mitigate those trends," Fitch said in a statement. In April, Fitch downgraded South Africa's credit rating to sub-investment grade after President Jacob Zuma abruptly fired Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, saying it would likely result in a change in economic policy direction. Moody's and S&P Global Ratings are due to announce their decisions on Friday.
