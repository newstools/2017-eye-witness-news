                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Zweli Mkhize says he has the experience needed to unify the ANC after its elective conference in just less than 50 days. Mkhize says his time in the provincial executive committee in KZN and his position as the current treasurer general, among other positions he has held in the party, will play a vital role in leading the party to new depths. He has been speaking at the 702 Town Hall on the Karima Brown show on Wednesday evening. Mkhize says if elected to the top job he will bring a balanced leadership. “One needs to focus on what we can do to rebuild, strengthen and unify the ANC. The issue of unity is very important. Secondly, we need to focus on the creation of a capable state.”
