Judge Dayalin Chetty handed down the guilty verdict in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Panayiotou's 31st birthday on Thursday. CAPE TOWN - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has welcomed the conviction of wife killer Christopher Panayiotou and two others. Judge Dayalin Chetty handed down the guilty verdict in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Panayiotou's 31st birthday on Thursday. The businessman orchestrated Jayde Panayiotou's murder in April 2015. The NPA's Tshepo Ndwalaza said: “We are very satisfied with the judgment today and believe that this will bring closure to the family of the deceased.” His two co-accused Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko have also been found guilty. Nenembe has been found guilty of robbery with aggravating circumstances and murder. Sibeko has been convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The middleman Luthando Siyoni had turned State witness and the triggerman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke died of an illness in prison while awaiting trial. Panayiotou's family was visibly emotional following the judgment and sat staring down with their heads bowed as they wiped away tears. The matter has been postponed to 17 November for sentencing proceedings.
