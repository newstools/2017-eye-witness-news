                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom is reportedly forging ahead with plans to reboot a nuclear tender despite terminating its new build request for information in 2017 following a court decision.  The Cape Town High Court terminated the process, forcing the utility to reject all requests for the submissions of information.   Fin24 is now reporting that Eskom is going ahead with preparations for a new build programme.  Nuclear vendors from France, Russia and China had prepared lengthy documents to submit to the Eskom in the first round of the tender process. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
