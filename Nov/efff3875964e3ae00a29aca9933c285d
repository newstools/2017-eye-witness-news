                                         CAPE TOWN - National Education, Health, and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu)  is calling for the Secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana to be suspended pending disciplinary proceedings against him. Mgidlana has been on special leave for five months during an investigation into allegations relating to his insistence on being driven in blue-light vehicles, travelling with his wife and stays in plush hotels, with Parliament footing the bill. Presiding officers have given Mgidlana seven days to say why he should not be placed on precautionary suspension, but he's told Eyewitness News he's confident he'll be cleared of any wrongdoing. Nehawu's parliamentary branch secretary Temba Gubula said: “He should be suspended with immediate effect because you place somebody on precautionary suspension when you’re going to conduct an investigation. In his case, an investigation has been conducted and the audit committee has established that there’s a case to be answered.”
