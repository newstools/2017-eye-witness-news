                                         JOHANNESBURG - Higher Education Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize has told Eyewitness News that she is concerned with some aspects of the fees commission report which has finally been released by President Jacob Zuma. Mkhize says students requesting private bank loans to finance their studies will hinder economic growth in the long run. Minister Mkhize says private loans open to students as per the fees commission report will create a generation who may not be able to deal with economic consequences. “The principle of handing over the students to private institutions, I’m a little bit worried about that." Mkhize says she hopes that through analysis of the report by her department and government, there will be consensus on a clear position that is fair to students and government. Mkhize has also reacted to the resignation of the deputy director general in the Treasury’s budget office, Michael Sachs, saying it will not affect any plans to roll out recommendations on higher education. MDUDUZI MANANA Mkhize says Mduduzi Manana has learnt a tough lesson and now has a chance to re-evaluate his life. The former Deputy Higher Education minister was sentenced to a year in prison or a R100, 000 fine on Monday in the Randburg Magistrates Court for assaulting three women at a Johannesburg restaurant in August. Mkhize says Manana could still do good work in public service. “We are grateful though that he has an opportunity to go through a process of re-evaluating his life and really emerge. He is a young leader with an amazing potential and high levels of commitment.” WATCH: Hlengiwe Mkhize reacts to fees commission report
