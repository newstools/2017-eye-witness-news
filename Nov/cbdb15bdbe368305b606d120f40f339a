                                         JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says its director of public prosecutions in Gauteng has declined to prosecute four Hawks officials accused of holding a former South African Revenue Services  official hostage. Vlok Symington  was held against his will, allegedly by the group of Hawks officials in a boardroom last year. Symington claims he’s being hounded for his role in revealing how the Hawks allegedly engineered charges against former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The NPA has told the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) there is no prospect of a successful prosecution after the police watchdog recommended criminal charges, including kidnapping, assault and intimidation be instituted against four Hawks officials. The NPA's Luvuyo Mfaku said: “The director of public prosecutions in North Gauteng decided not to prosecute because he believed that there are no prospects of a successful prosecution. Meaning the state would not prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.” In a letter addressed to Ipid, the NPA says Symington's various statements over the incident are "contradictory". During the boardroom stand-off almost a year ago, Symington refused to hand over documents to Hawks investigators and Sars commissioner Tom Moyane's bodyguard. The documents, relating to the fraud charges against Gordhan, had been sent to Symington by mistake.
