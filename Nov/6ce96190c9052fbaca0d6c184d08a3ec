                                         HARARE - There are reports that President Robert Mugabe may now be on the move. The president’s motorcade was reportedly spotted driving through northern Harare early on Thursday afternoon. The amateur video of the motorcade was circulated on social media.   It appears to show Mugabe’s motorcade speeding through Harare’s northern Borrowdale suburb. That’s close to where Mugabe lives, and where he is said to have been detained by the army since Wednesday. Speculation is rife on Thursday, on how negotiations are going between the president and the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. Some reports say the president is refusing to step down; others suggest he could soon hand over power to his former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. In the meantime, the US and UK embassies have urged their citizens to exercise caution, saying the political situation remains uncertain.
