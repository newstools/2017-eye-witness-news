                                         JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says the government has subpoenaed three former Gauteng health executives, including former MEC Qedani Mahlangu, to have them testify at the Esidimeni arbitration hearings. Mahlangu is one of the key witnesses, given that she signed off on the Esidimeni project. Some 141 psychiatric patients died after the Health Department terminated its contract with Esidimeni. Motsoaledi was speaking on the sidelines after President Jacob Zuma's visit to the Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Tshwane. Motsoaledi says the government has done its part in terms of making sure Mahlangu testifies at the Esidimeni arbitration hearings. “On Monday, the government subpoenaed three people, the HOD who’s been put on suspension, Dr Makgabo Manamela and the MEC. They’ve been subpoenaed to appear in December. We’re hoping they will because if they don’t, then you ask Justice Dikgang Moseneke the matter will no longer be on our hands.” Retired Deputy Chief Justice Moseneke has made it clear that the arbitration will not conclude until Mahlangu and her former HOD and director for mental health have appeared before him. The hearing continues next Wednesday. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
