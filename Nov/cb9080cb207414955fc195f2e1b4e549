                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Defence Union (Sandu) says it's going ahead and opening a criminal case  because former Eskom boss Brian Molefe doesn't have the qualifications to be a military colonel. According to the City Press newspaper, Molefe has been called up to serve in the army and is earning R57,000 a month. Molefe who has been linked to the controversial Gupta family during his time at Transnet and Eskom resumed his duties in the army in August. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says Molefe has been a reserve officer since 2009. But the Defence Union's Pikkie Greeff says he doesn't have the military rank to serve in this capacity. “This is so irregular and unlawful, but it's been done. We don’t need to speak to them about this, we’re simply going ahead and laying criminal charges. It’s very clear that this appointment is fraudulent.” At the same time, the defence force says it's not aware of any payments to Molefe this year. Although the SANDF acknowledges that Molefe has been a reserve force member and a colonel for several years, the army says his last recorded salary payment was in 2010. Spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini said: “I’m aware that he has been called up recently, but that does not appear on my printouts. I can say without fear or favour that he has been called up and was last paid in 2010, according to the report that I have in front of me.”
