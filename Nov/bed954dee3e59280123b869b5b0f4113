                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has criticised President Jacob Zuma has criticised President Jacob Zuma's withdrawal from attending the launch of the 16 Days of Activism campaign, saying it's a sign the African National Congress (ANC) is dead. Saturday morning was the launch of South Africa's 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children at Nelson Mandela University in the Eastern Cape. Shortly after the event was supposed to start, the Presidency sent out a notice stating Zuma would no longer attend as keynote speaker. It's still unclear why the president withdrew from the event. The DA says the launch was poorly attended and that it's a sign that Port Elizabeth residents no longer care for the ANC. The ruling party lost the Nelson Mandela Bay metro to the DA in the 2016 local government election.
