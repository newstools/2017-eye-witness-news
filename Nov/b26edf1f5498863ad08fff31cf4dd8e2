                                         JOHANNESBURG - An Eskom report has painted an alarming picture of funding difficulties and declining liquidity at the power utility. EE Publishers and Fin24 are reporting that acting chair Zethembe Khoza has handed the report to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown.  The document reportedly highlights cash flow problems, primarily driven by perceptions of poor governance, and adds compelling substance to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s recent medium term budget statement that Eskom’s financial position is the most serious threat facing the economy. The report states that, without any further funding, Eskom will have only approximately R1.2 billion of liquid assets at the end of this month against a target of R20 billion.  It will move into a negative liquidity position by the end of January. The report also states that the qualified audit opinion relating to irregular expenditure and changes in leadership have had a negative impact on investor sentiment, which has affected future funding. Last month, acting CEO Johnny Dladla was moved back to his previous position at Eskom and Sean Maritz was appointed as the new acting CEO, even though Brown had indicated that a permanent CEO should be in place by the end of November. It’s understood that Eskom is in discussion with banks to provide a short-term bridge-to-bond facility to mitigate funding risks. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
