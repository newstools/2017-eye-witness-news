                                         CAPE TOWN - Nature lovers can expect tariff increases at the five major parks across the Western Cape. These are Agulhas, Bontebok, Tankwa Karoo, Table Mountain and West Coast National Parks. The annual conservation rates increases can be viewed on the SANParks' website.  SANParks' Merle Collins said: “The good news for Capetonians is that except for Boulders and the Cape Point that increases from R70 to R75 and from 135 to R154, all the picnic tariffs remain the same.”
