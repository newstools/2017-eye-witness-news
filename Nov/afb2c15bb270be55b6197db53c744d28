                                         CAPE TOWN - Sentencing proceedings against convicted wife killer Christopher Panayiotou and his accomplices has been postponed for a week in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Friday. Panayiotou along with Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko were convicted of his spouse’s killing earlier in November. The businessman hired men to kill his wife, Port Elizabeth school teacher Jayde Panayiotou in April 2015. She was kidnapped outside her home and her body was found a day later on the outskirts of Uitenhage. State prosecutor Marius Stander called the sister of Jayde Panayiotou to testify in aggravation of sentence. An emotional Toni Inggs read out an emotional letter explaining her family’s suffering. Panayiotou was shot dead execution-style on the instruction of her husband. Inggs has highlighted how her sister’s murder has affected her ability to trust people. She adds her family won’t ever forgive Christopher Panayiotou for his actions. The defence counsel has requested a postponement of a pre-sentence report. The matter resumes next Thursday.
