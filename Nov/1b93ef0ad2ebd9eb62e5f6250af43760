JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in Gauteng says it welcomes the decision by the man accused of raping his domestic worker to abandon his bail application. The 45-year-old man appeared before the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate Court on Thursday on charges of rape, kidnapping and sexual assault, among others. It’s alleged he forced the woman to perform lewd sexual acts on him and compelled her to have sex with his dogs. The NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana said: “As the NPA we welcome this decision. We are glad he decided to remain in custody because we’re of the view that the allegations levelled against him are of a serious nature.” Mjonondwana says the matter has been postponed until 5 February for further investigation.
