                                         CAPE TOWN - Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe says there’s no Plan B should discussions falter between the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the Post Office on an agreement to pay social grants. But he’s given a firm commitment to Parliament that current service provider Cash Paymaster Services will not be asked to come to the rescue again.  A collaborative agreement between Sassa and the Post Office is now expected to be signed by Friday. Sassa is still determining the capabilities of the Post Office to deliver a wider range of services than previously suggested. While there is a blueprint for the collaboration, no formal agreement has been signed.  Radebe says there’s no back up plan.  “We have one plan and that plan is to implement the court order and the directives of the Constitutional Court. That is our plan.”  The expert panel appointed by the Constitutional Court has however suggested that Sassa deposit money directly into the commercial bank accounts of beneficiaries, and assist those who don’t have accounts, to acquire them.
