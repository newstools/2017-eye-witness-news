                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has rejected reports suggesting that its special national executive committee (NEC) meeting currently underway in Pretoria is discussing the possible removal of secretary-general Gwede Mantashe. Broadcaster eNCA on Monday reported that there are calls for Mantashe to be sacked after Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa mentioned him on his slate. It said that a decision on Mantashe’s fate would be made at the NEC meeting. Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma’s campaign told Eyewitness News last week that Mantashe is conflicted in his position after being named on Ramaphosa’s slate. It was reported on Monday morning that since Ramaphosa’s announcement, that some NEC members want Mantashe to be sacked. But the ANC has rubbished these reports, describing them as malicious and mischievous. The ANC says that the rumours are aimed at sowing confusion and division within the party. The party says that its decided to go against tradition and issue this statement because of the serious nature of the rumours. It’s called on its members and supporters to reject what it calls the “frenzy of fake news” and wait for formal communication on the outcome of the special meeting. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
