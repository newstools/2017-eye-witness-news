                                         JOHANNESBURG - KwaZulu-Natal police say there is an increased tendency by criminals to target police stations because they believe they are soft targets. On Friday night, a gang of armed men entered the Elandslaagte police station demanding the keys to the safe. A police officer was shot in the leg during the ambush and later taken to the hospital. Authorities say this new trend is concerning as it’s not the first time a similar incident has occurred in the area. The police's Thembeka Mbele said, “These criminals are taking chances because it was at night and officers are patrolling or attending to complaints.”
