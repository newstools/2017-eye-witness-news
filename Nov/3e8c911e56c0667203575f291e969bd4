                                         CAPE TOWN - Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi  is set to appear before Parliament's Transport Committee next week as it looks to get its state capture inquiry off the ground. It’s one of four committees instructed by Parliament’s House chairperson to probe state capture allegations. It’s been alleged that the Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane allegedly attempted to benefit from a R51 billion tender for trains. It’s also been claimed that the Guptas and Zuma exerted pressure on former Prasa chief executive Lucky Montana and then Transport Minister Ben Martins, to favour a Chinese company to provide 600 commuter trains. Chairperson of Parliament's Transport Committee Dikeledi Magadzi says that getting to the bottom of the state capture allegations has been hampered by court processes. The committee has prepared a preliminary report on the allegations it wants Maswanganyi to answer to.  “Part of the things that the committee would probably like to know is progress to date in terms of the Public Protector’s report.”  Last month, Cabinet appointed an interim board for the rail agency, after a leadership vacuum of more than three months, which has raised concerns over the legality of decisions taken during that time.
