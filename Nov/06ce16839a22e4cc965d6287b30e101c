                                         SUN CITY - Branden Grace sank a 40-foot birdie put on the 16th hole to set up a victory at the Nedbank Golf Challenge on Sunday as he carded a blistering final round 66 to win by a single shot from Briton Scott Jamieson. The 29-year-old came from three shots back overnight at the Gary Player Country Club for an 11-under-par total of 277, an eighth European Tour victory and a $1.17 million purse in the penultimate event of the season. Grace is the first home winner of South Africa’s biggest tournament - dubbed Africa’s Major - since Trevor Immelman a decade ago after going out in 33 on Sunday and then sinking three more birdies on the back nine for a six-under-par round. Jamieson, 33, had a one-shot lead after Saturday but ended on 278 after a final round 70 which included a double bogey at the eighth hole.
