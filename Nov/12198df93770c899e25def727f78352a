                                         CAPE TOWN - A local retail giant says with Christmas just a few weeks away, it'll continue to keep its chicken and egg shelves full. The Western Cape's food industry has been hit hard this year with the ongoing drought and the outbreak of bird flu. Avian flu has had a massive impact on the poultry sector due to the death of more than two million birds.  Deputy General Manager for food buying at Shoprite Checkers Jaco Brand said: “So far we’ve managed to keep the shelves full. we’ve been working very closely with all our major produces just to ensure that we have sufficient stock procured, as well as more ways to move forward to ensure that we don’t run out of stock.  "So, we’ve worked with suppliers all over South Africa. The Western Cape has been rather badly affected compared to the other provinces.”
