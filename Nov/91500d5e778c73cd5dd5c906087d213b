                                         JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says its time South Africans liberated themselves from those who liberated them from apartheid. Maimane was addressing the DA Gauteng congress on Saturday in Midrand where John Moodey was re-elected party leader in Gauteng. Moodey was contesting to retain the position while Ghaleb Cachalia was aiming for the role too. But the majority of the 1,079 members registered chose Moodey Provincial leader says he has what it takes to take the party to a majority rule in Gauteng. He says now the real campaigning for 2019 general elections will begin. “Real leadership is what we’re going to bring in Gauteng, let us walk the journey as one team.” At the same time, Maimane says the da is ready to take over provincial governance in the province. “But first we must be liberated and then we must liberate ourselves from the liberators. That’s what Zimbabweans are learning and that’s what here in South Africa we must make clear that once communities are being uplifted, the job is far from done.” Maimane says the party needs an additional 1.5 million votes to win the province.
