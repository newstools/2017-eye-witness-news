                                         JOHANNESBURG - National chair of the African National Congress (ANC) Baleka Mbete says she was approached by ordinary members of the party to avail herself to run for Presidency and believes it is time for her to give back to the party. Lindiwe Sisulu, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Mbete - who is speaking on 702's Karima Brown show on Monday night - are the three female candidates contesting for the top job in the ANC. Mbete says even though she is up against other women, it is not really a competition, it is just them offering themselves to the organisation. “It’s not like the women in the race if you call it a race, are competing against each other as just three women. We are offering ourselves to our membership at the ANC conference for them to consider and decide on, and finalise the matter of one of the seven [candidates].” WATCH: Baleka Mbete Town Hall discussion
