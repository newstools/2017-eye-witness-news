                                         CAPE TOWN - A comprehensive festive season plan has been rolled out by the City of Cape Town to ensure the safety of residents this holiday.  Over 1,000 members from various law enforcement departments will be deployed to carry out the city's festive season policing plan. Other departments that will assist include, fire and rescue services, disaster risk management and social development. Road and beach safety are among two of the main focus areas for the city. The city's JP Smith explains: “We’re only opening a third of all the swimming pools so we’ve increased the number of beach lifeguards. We urge the public to mind their behaviour and act responsibly.”
