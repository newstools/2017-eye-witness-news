                                         JOHANNESBURG - Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga says that authorities are now investigating whether cable tampering could have contributed to the collapse of an overhead lighting post which killed five children.  The children were playing in Soshanguve at the weekend when part of the structure fell on them.  Four died at the scene while the fifth child died in hospital.  Msimanga will on Monday morning visit the families of the victims.  He says it wouldn’t be the first time that criminals have tried to steal these kinds of cables. “These people would pull down these lights. They’re taking the cables inside and there seems to be a growing phenomenon because we’d find these things in taverns and car washes.” At the same time, police are investigating the details surrounding the death of two children who drowned at an exposed construction site in Orange Farm.  The two boys, aged nine and 10, died last week while trying to retrieve house keys that had fallen into a hole filled with water.
