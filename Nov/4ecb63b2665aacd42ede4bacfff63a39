                                         JOHANNESBURG - Trade union National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the United Front say they will picket outside Eskom headquarters at Megawatt Park on Thursday for various issues involving the utility. The union says it will hand over a memorandum of demands focusing on Eskom’s outrageous request for a 19.9% tariff increase and labour brokering, among others. It says corruption of Eskom management and board as well as what it calls "the apartheid wage gap" in the power utility’s workplace are some of their major concerns. The union says Eskom is poorly led and its senior management team is drowning in scandals. Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi said: “As Numsa we view this demand by Eskom as nothing more than a gross abuse of power and an attempt by the SOE to hold the entire country and the economy hostage. And now they’ve got the nerve to ask the members of the public to entrust them with more money when they’ve demonstrated complete incompetence and corruption.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
