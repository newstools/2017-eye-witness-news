                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Cyril Ramaphosa has called on corrupt officials who have looted state coffers to come forward with that money, so that the government can use it for service delivery. Ramaphosa was addressing a South African Communist Party (SACP) rally in Mpumalanga on Saturday where he called for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission into corruption. He says the economy is struggling precisely because of state capture and corruption in public enterprises. Ramaphosa says the TRC will be responsible for bringing back the money spent on corrupt activities and bring to book those who are implicated but aren't coming forward. He says people lying to the commission should be arrested. “We must do what we can because when we end corruption then the international community and companies will invest in our economy. We must transform our economy.  “The first thing is to do things the right way; we must make sure that there’s a rule of law in our country.”
