                                         SUTHERLAND SPRINGS - The man accused of killing 26 peopl e including an 18-month-old child at a Texas church had sent threatening text messages to his in-laws who sometimes attended the house of worship before launching the latest United States (US) mass shooting, officials said on Monday. “There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters. “The mother-in-law attended the church. We know he sent threatening ... that she had received threatening text messages from him.” The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child and sentenced to 12 months confinement. He received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations. Kelley, 26, walked into the white-steepled First Baptist Church in rural Sutherland Springs on Sunday carrying a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle and wearing a black bulletproof vest, then opened fire during prayer service. He wounded at least 20 others, officials said. After he left the church, two local residents, including one who was armed, chased Kelley in a truck and they exchanged gunfire. The chase ended when Kelley crashed his car and may have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from the Good Samaritan’s weapon, said Martin. An autopsy will determine the cause of death, Martin said. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said in an interview that the family members had not been present at the time of Kelley’s attack.
