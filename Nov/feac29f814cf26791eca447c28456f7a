                                         CAPE TOWN - The official opposition wants Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance to look into alleged political interference in budgetary processes.  The call comes in the wake of the resignation of Treasury budget chief Michael Sachs. There are concerns of meddling in budget priorities by the Presidency.  Treasury has moved to allay fears, saying that there are no indications that other officials are also preparing to quit.  Sachs's resignation has thrown a spanner in the works as Treasury prepares the country's new budget framework.  But Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete says there are competent officials to replace him. “Michael Sachs has seven chief directors under him, all of whom has played a very integral part in grooming over the years.” Economist Thabi Leoka says that while ratings agencies will note the reasons for Sachs's departure, other factors are likely to have more of an effect. “The debt to GDP ratio, the budget deficit, our ability to recover from this low growth, how is politics affecting certain institutions, that's what's more pivotal to them.” Sachs is not expected to leave the institution until a replacement has been appointed.
