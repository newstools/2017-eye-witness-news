                                         JOHANNESBURG - Bafana Bafana  coach Stuart Baxter  says he wants to finish the qualifying campaign on a high note despite not qualifying for the World Cup in Russia next year. Bafana Bafana play their return leg against Senegal in Dakar on Tuesday night, a game that has little consequence as Senegal have already secured their spot for Russia 2018 with a 2-0 victory over South Africa in Polokwane on Friday last week. Baxter says that Bafana will aim to finish strongly in Dakar. “We want to finish really well and in the highest position as we possibly can in this group”. The Bafana mentor also says that Tuesday’s game provides players with an opportunity to impress. “This is a great opportunity for some of the younger players to put up their hands and say look at me, instead of looking anywhere else.” The game kicks off at 21:30 pm South African time.
