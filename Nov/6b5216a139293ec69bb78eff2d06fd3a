                                         CAPE TOWN - Treasury is appearing before a joint Parliamentary meeting to discuss its review of the impasse between South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the Post Office. It was requested to intervene last week and compile a report for the inter-ministerial committee to advise on how to break the deadlock over the payment of social grants. Thereâ€™s just less than five months to go, before Sassa is expected to comply with a Constitutional Court deadline to take over the payment of grants.
