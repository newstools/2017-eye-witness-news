                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gupta-owned Tegeta has threatened to shut down coal supply to Eskom just as the power utility discovered that thousands of tons of coal have gone missing. In an amaBhungane exclusive, leaked minutes of an Eskom meeting on Friday reveal that the power utility retaliated by threatening legal action. Tegeta - owned by the Gupta's, Trillian founder Salim Essa and the president's son Duduzane Zuma - wanted Eskom to increase the amount it pays for coal. According to AmaBhungane, Eskom only had a seven-day coal stockpile for the Hendrina Power Station on Monday and managers were warned that they may be forced to shut down the station and run expensive open cycle gas turbines or make peace with load shedding. Leaked documents have revealed that Tegeta’s threat to cut coal supply came just as Eskom discovered a massive miscalculation that over-estimated the size of Hendrina's strategic coal stockpile. It’s also alleged that the Gupta-owned company hasn’t been meeting its contractual obligation and has been exporting coal while starving Eskom of the supply it is legally entitled to. Eskom says that the situation is under control with another unit at Medupi connected to the grid this week. The power utility has repeatedly told the public that the days of load shedding are over but these leaked documents show that blackouts were a real risk.
