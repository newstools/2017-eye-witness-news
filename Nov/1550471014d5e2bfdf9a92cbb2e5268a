                                         JOHANNESBURG - There's been a massive power outage at Exclusive Books at the Hyde Park Shopping Centre during the launch of Jacques Pauw's book The President's Keepers. Eskom has claimed responsibility for the unplanned power cuts which went out as Pauw was addressing the crowd. He told the audience that there's a lot of money being poured into state security agencies but there is no accountability of its use. He says the agency is a black hole used for fraud and corruption. The State Security Agency and Sars threatened to head to court in a bid to ban the book. Pauw says the agency wants to take legal action because it doesn’t want the truth to be known. “Crime Intelligence has a budget as a secret fund of around R600 million a year. Nobody audits that, it’s a black hole in which they pour your money and now they are saying to me: we’re going to take you to court.” At the same time, about a thousand people have gathered at centre for the launch. Exclusive Books CEO Benjamin Trisk says sales have been through the roof. “I phoned our procurement manager and said to her: whatever the order was, triple it. Triple the books has become 20 times that number in a space of a week.”
