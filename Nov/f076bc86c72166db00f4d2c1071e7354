                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Water and Sanitation says the top three defaulting municipalities have already started making payment arrangements.  About 30 municipalities owe over R10 billion rad and they've been given until next week Friday to settle their last two months accounts and make arrangements for their historic debts. Matjhabeng Local Municipality in the Free State is on top of the list with R1.8 billion.  Limpopo’s Vhembe and Mopani’s district municipalities are the second and third most defaulting municipalities.  Vhembe Municipality's Matodzi Ralushai says the amount the department says it owes, does not reconcile with their financial statements. “In terms of the bills they’ve indicated, we’ve raised a concern with them during our engagement with the department in July this year.” Mopani Municipality's Neil Shikwambana says their arrangements are at an advanced stage. “We do have an arrangement because that debt is not an overnight thing, it’s a storage debt which is over seven years old and I can tell you that this financial year alone, we’ve paid about R70 million."
