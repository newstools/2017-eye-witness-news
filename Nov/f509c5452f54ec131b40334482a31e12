                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former anti-apartheid activist Lord Peter Hain  says he's produced evidence of illegal transactions between the Gupta family’s South African bank accounts and a British-based bank account. He also says he's requested that the evidence be handed to the serious fraud and national crime agency. Hain was addressing the House of Lords on Wednesday evening at the second reading of the new Money Laundering Bill. He's been at the forefront of highlighting the alleged role of international banks and financial institutions in laundering the proceeds of state capture by the Gupta family. Hain says the evidence is now available for investigation. “I have delivered by hand last night to the chancellor printed out transactions and named the British bank concerned and asked again that he refer these to the serious fraud office, the national crime agency and the financial conduct authority for investigation.” He says the documents are damning. “This information shows illegal transfers of funds from South Africa, made by the Gupta family over the last few years from their South African accounts to accounts held in Hong Kong.”
