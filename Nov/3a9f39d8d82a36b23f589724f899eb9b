                                         JOHANNESBURG - Joburg Water says it’s currently fixing two leaks on a pipe which services the Sandton area but has assured residents that supply will not be interrupted. Taps in and around Sandton were dry for up to four days last week due to a burst pipe. Joburg Water’s Isaac Dhuldhlu says residents will not be affected this time around. “We’re not suspending any water provision for now until we refill all the reservoirs. We’ll only be able to repair the lines once all the reservoirs are fully filled and we’ll then be able to provide water to all residents.”
