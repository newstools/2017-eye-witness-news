                                         JOHANNESBURG -The spread of wildfires ravaging communities will now be a thing of the past with the newly built Thokoza fire station set to extinguish them effectively. On Friday, Ekurhuleni’s Member of the Mayoral Committee Vivienne Chauke handed over the R50 million state of the art fire station to serve the community of Thokoza and Katlehong. It will also respond to high-risk Alrode industrial area which has potentially flammable petrol depots in the vicinity. The fire station was constructed over two years and provided employment opportunities for 66 local labourers and six local subcontractors. Its continued presence will also contribute to the general upliftment of the Thokoza area. “The community must protect and defend this facility. We have spent a lot of money to bring development and employment opportunities for the people of Thokoza. It is therefore important that we look after resources that belong to the community,” MMC Chauke said. The new structure is fully equipped with a new water tanker, a major pumper, rescue pumper, medium pumper and four ambulances as well as five fire engines.
