                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma  has denied his Cabinet reshuffles  defy logic. He says he has the right to make changes and anyone wanting to know the reasons should first win elections themselves. Zuma’s shuffled his Cabinet 12 times in seven years. Opposition members pressed him for his reasons during his last oral reply session in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on Thursday. On axing former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande, President Zuma said: “There is no decision that the Presidency has taken that has defied logic. There isn’t, not a single one” Democratic Alliance members asked if David Mahlobo was moved from State Security to Energy because of his “cosy relationship with the Russians” and to push through the nuclear deal. Zuma responded: “Changing ministers is the prerogative of the president. There are reasons that are not necessarily to be known by people… if you want to know these questions you must win elections and have a government, so that you can get to know… “ NCOP chairperson Thandi Modise ruled a question on whether he intends replacing his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa with Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as out of order. Zuma says poor performance isn’t the only reason for making changes to his Cabinet. “It is not only that ministers are removed because they are lazy, there are other reasons that lead to presidents taking decisions and, therefore, to try to find the reason is really looking for a needle in a prairie.”
