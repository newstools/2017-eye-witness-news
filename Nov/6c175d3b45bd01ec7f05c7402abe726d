                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings are expected to continue in Parktown on Wednesday morning with more testimony from family members who lost their loved ones and discussion about former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu being subpoenaed to testify. The arbitration is aimed at achieving truth justice and redress for the families of the 141 psychiatric patients who died after the Gauteng Health Department moved them into unlawful NGO. The department had decided to terminate its contract with the Esidimeni group, apparently to cut costs. The alternative dispute resolution process has successfully uncovered evidence that could lead to criminal charges against top health officials and owners of the unlawful NGOs that took in mentally ill patients without adequate qualifications, experience or premises. The hearings have also exposed the officialsâ€™ attempts to cover up their culpability. Last week, Dorothy Franks, the owner of Anchor House where five people died, admitted to withdrawing and using money from South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) cards belonging to patients who had already died. Franks also told the hearings that the Gauteng Health Department continued to pay her thousands of rands months after her NGO was closed.
