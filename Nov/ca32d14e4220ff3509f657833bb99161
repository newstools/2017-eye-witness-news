                                         CAPE TOWN - Minerals Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has failed to turn up in Parliament to answer a second round of questions on state capture because he’s apparently sick.  Zwane accused the Mineral Resources Portfolio Committee of  attempted character assassination when he was probed about his relationship with the Gupta family last month.  The committee says it will now request him to appear early in the new year when Parliament resumes business. The committee is one of four parliamentary groups that's been ordered to investigate allegations of state capture.But it hasn’t got very far. Zwane answered their questions at a meeting in October and said he would return this week. Committee chairperson Zet Luzipho says: “We expect a sick note, but I agree with members. You can’t just sit on one issue. At some point we need to make a definite decision.” The Democratic Alliance says that Zwane should be subpoenaed to appear, but Luzipho says the committee should accept that he’s unwell.
