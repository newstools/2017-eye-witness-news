                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says it will be all systems go for a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into state capture, as soon as court proceedings around the Public Protector’s State of Capture report have been finalised. President Jacob Zuma is challenging the remedial action of that report in the Gauteng High Court. Answering questions in the National Assembly on Thursday afternoon, Ramaphosa says corruption is the enemy of the people and prohibits services from being delivered to those who need them. Ramaphosa says Parliament should be lauded for its inquiry into state capture at Eskom. He says it’s public perception that there’s massive wrongdoing at state-owned enterprises. Ramaphosa has once again reiterated government’s commitment to a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into state capture. “Because we all believe that that is the best way of getting to the bottom of the truth and unravelling the wrongdoing that has happened through the state capture issue.” He says corruption is the biggest threat to governance at state-owned enterprises and those who have stolen money, must return it and be brought to book.
