                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Agriculture Department says it plans to plough all its efforts into rebuilding the local poultry industry. Officials say there've been no new reported bird flu cases in the province, signalling the worst may be over.  Tens of thousands of chickens and ducks have died or have been culled after contracting avian influenza. The department's Bronwynne Jooste explains: “The focus for animal health technicians right now is to support farmers to ensure their poultry houses are clean, so that they can start the stocking process. “In terms of price increases, there have been some increases, but we will have official numbers next week when Stats SA reveals its consumer price index.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
