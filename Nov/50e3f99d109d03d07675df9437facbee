                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Finance MEC Barbara Creecy has allocated over R13 million to the Esidimeni arbitration process.  Creecy delivered her Medium-Term Budget in the legislature earlier on Thursday.  Over 140 psychiatric patients died after the Gauteng Health Department terminated its contract with the Life Esidimeni group. Creecy allocated an additional R24 million to the office of the premier, over R13 million of which has been given to the Esidimeni arbitration process.  According to the budget, the amount will cover the venue, transport, catering and other costs.  Creecy says the department cannot continue to ignore waste of money. “We also have to accept that there are significant problems with the managerial capacity in the Department of Health.” She’s also raised issues on accruals in the Health Department.  While the department owes about R3.7 billion to suppliers and contractors, Creecy says they’ve managed to settle outstanding invoices with over 1,700 service providers. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
