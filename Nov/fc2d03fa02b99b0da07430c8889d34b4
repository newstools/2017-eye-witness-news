                                         SEOUL - South Korea will never recognise or tolerate North Korea as a nuclear state, nor will Seoul ever have its own nuclear weapons, the South’s President Moon Jae-in said in an address to the National Assembly on Wednesday. Moon also said there can be no military action on the Korean peninsula without the South’s consent, adding the government will continue working for peace on the peninsula. Moon’s remarks came a day after South Korea and China announced they would work together towards resolving the North Korean nuclear issue via all diplomatic means.
