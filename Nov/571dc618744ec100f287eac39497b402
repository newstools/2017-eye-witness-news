                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Cyril Ramaphosa  has called upon the party members to elect Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor as his deputy president in the December elective conference. Addressing his campaign rally at the Tafelkopp stadium in Ga-Sekhukhune in Limpopo, Ramaphosa called upon the party members to elect leaders who are capable of taking the movement and the country forward. He has also urged members to elect other leaders including ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe, former chairperson of the party in KwaZulu Natal Senzo Mchunu and Gauteng Chair Paul Mashatile in the top six positions. Ramaphosa says these are credible leaders who can renew the ANC to its original state. Ramaphosa has announced his preferred candidates to lead the ANC after December elective conference as follows: “Comrade Senzo Mchunu, secretary general, comrade Naledi Pandor, deputy president, comrade Gwede Mantashe, national chairperson, comrade Paul Mashatile, treasurer general.”
