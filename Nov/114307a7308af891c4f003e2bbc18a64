                                         JOHANNESBURG - Both the US and British embassies are advising citizens in Zimbabwe to limit unnecessary movements as the country’s political uncertainty continues. The military remains on the streets of the capital Harare, a day after generals seized power in a targeted operation against so-called “criminals” in President Robert Mugabe’s entourage. It’s been reported that Mugabe himself insists he remains the country’s only legitimate ruler. Reuters is reporting that Mugabe is also resisting mediation by a Catholic priest, to allow the 93-year-old former guerrilla a graceful exit after a military takeover. The African Diaspora Forum is calling on Mugabe to ensure a peaceful and quick transition of power. Spokesman Marc Gbaffou said: “Mugabe needs to leave Zimbabwe. I think he should be granted refugee status in one of the African countries and South Africa is well placed to host him because of its leadership role in the SADC.” Meanwhile, Mugabe’s main opposition rival has returned to the country amid efforts to form a transitional government. Morgan Tsvangirai, who had been receiving cancer treatment abroad, returned to Harare earlier on Thursday in the wake of the takeover. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
