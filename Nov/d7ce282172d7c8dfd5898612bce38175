                                         JOHANNESBURG - The SABC board's deputy chair Febe Potgieter-Gqubule says the appointment of executives is important and urgent, which is why they are filing an affidavit to protect the independence of the public broadcaster. Board member Rachel Kalidass resigned last week after raising concerns about the process followed in the appointment of the permanent CEO and COO of the SABC. Potgieter-Gqubule says the board should have the right to hire and fire executives as there have been some unfortunate experiences in the past. “Therefore the powers of the board, to be able to go through a transparent and rigorous process and to be able to appoint and hold executives accountable, is something that we are very committed to.  "And hence the decision to file the affidavit to be able to say that this matter is urgent, that the SABC has been without executives for too long.”
