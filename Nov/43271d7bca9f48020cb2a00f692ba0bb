                                         JOHANNESBURG - Real Madrid and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo celebrated the birth of his fourth child Alana Martina on Sunday. The recently crowned world footballer of the year posted a picture of himself with girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez and seven-year-old son Cristiano Junior, with Rodriguez holding the new born baby on his official Twitter account. Ronaldo is also the father of twins Eva, and Mateo who were born in June this year via a surrogate. The Portuguese captain was able to be present for the birth of his daughter due to being rested by Portugal national coach Fernando Santos for the friendlies against Saudi Arabia and the United States of America. A Alana Martina acaba de nascer! Tanto a Geo como a Alana estão muito bem! Estamos todos muito felizes! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/nMT4rYc32U
