In a tweet, the awarded winery announced its latest achievement. CAPE TOWN – Nederburg has received another trophy to add to its list of achievements. In a tweet, the awarded winery announced that its 2013 II Centuries Cabernet Sauvignon received the coveted Warren Winiarski Trophy for the best Cabernet Sauvignon at the 2017 International Wine & Spirit Competition (IWSC), which was judged alongside equivalents from various wine producing countries.  Nederburg’s Private Bin R163 Cabernet Sauvignon was last year awarded the IWSC Arcadia Trophy, also for best Cabernet Sauvignon. This means that Nederburg has won the IWSC trophy for the best Cabernet Sauvignon twice in a row. “We are thrilled to have won the IWSC trophy for the best Cabernet Sauvignon, twice in a row,” says Andrea Freeborough, Nederburg’s cellar-master. “Most interestingly, both IWSC trophy-winning wines - the II Centuries Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 and Private Bin R163 Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 - were blended at Nederburg on the same day in October 2015! “Stylistically, the two wines are very distinct, each made from a unique set of individually selected barrels. Both are superbly made by hand, using meticulously selected grapes, with the utmost attention to detail applied during the winemaking process." Recently, Nederburg’s II Centuries Cabernet Sauvignon 2014 bagged the ‘Red Wine of the Year’ title in the 2018 edition of the Platter’s By Diners Club South African Wine Guide. The wine also achieved a five-star rating in the newly released guide, as did Nederburg’s Private Bin R109 Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot 2014. It was also announced Winery of the Year in the 2017 edition of Platter’s By Diners Club South African Wine Guide. You can buy Nederburg’s luxurious II Centuries collection online or at the farm in Paarl.  The Private Bin range is only available for sale at the annual Nederburg Auction.
