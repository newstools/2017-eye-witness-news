                                         ZIMBABWE - As factional fights escalate within Zimbabwe’s ruling party, some members are pushing for vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa to be fired. The calls came after Mnangagwa’s supporters were accused of heckling and booing first lady Grace Mugabe at a rally over the weekend. So far, two out of the 10 Zanu-PF provinces have called for Mnangagwa to be sacked. State media quotes Dickson Mafios, party chairman for Mashonaland Central, as saying next month’s party congress is for the “clean” and that the vice president should be sacked with immediate effect. The party’s Bulawayo provincial committee has made a similar call. State radio is reporting on Monday that the ruling party’s youth wing wants Mnangagwa out and that it will back the first lady to fill his post.
