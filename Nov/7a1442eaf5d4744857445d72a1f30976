                                         JOHANNESBURG - Kevin Anderson has failed to replicate the form that saw him reach the final of this year’s US Open, losing in three sets to Fernando Verdasco. At the time, Anderson, the world number 32, was the lowest-ranked US Open men’s singles finalist since the inception of the ATP rankings in 1973, but has since jumped up to 16th place after starting the season at number 80 after an injury ravaged 2016. The loss to Verdasco all but ends Anderson’s chances of qualifying for the year-ending ATP Finals. Going into the tournament, Anderson was in 10th position in the race to the ATP Finals, with only the top eight players qualifying for the event.
