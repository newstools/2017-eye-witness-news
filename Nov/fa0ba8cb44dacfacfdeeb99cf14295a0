The case was opened by former acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and is linked to Ipid’s fraud and corruption investigation of his conduct. JOHANNESBURG - Forensic consultant Paul O’Sullivan, his assistant and two Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) officials collectively face more than two dozen counts including corruption, fraud and racketeering. The State presented the charge sheet to the four accused when they appeared in the Pretoria magistrates court on Wednesday morning. The case was opened by former acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and is linked to Ipid’s fraud and corruption investigation of his conduct. O’Sullivan, his assistant Sarah-Jane Trent and Ipid investigators Mandla Mahlangu and Temane Binang face 34 counts. The charges relate to the contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, contravention of the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act as well as contravention of the Ipid Act and Intimidation Act. The most serious of them are the several counts of racketeering. However, it is unclear at this stage what they did to justify this charge. It emerged on Tuesday that the investigators, led by Major-General Jan Mabula, raided Ipid’s attorneys’ offices and took statements from their lawyers. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
