                                         CAPE TOWN -  The Health Department says all qualified final year medical students, including those in services like audiology and occupational therapy, will be get an internship next year. This comes after the Junior Doctors Association of South Africa (Judasa) launched a social media campaign called #unemployeddoctors.    Judasa aims to raise awareness about more than 280 final year medical students who don't have placements for internship which is compulsory. The South African Medical Association (Sama) on Thursday joined the call by Judasa for Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal to make more funded posts available. Sama’s Mzukisi Grootboom explains: “It will be a tragedy if we allow close to 300 students without training and jobs.” But Health Department Director-General Precious Matsoso says that she received commitments from provincial heads on Thursday that no qualified medical student will be without a placement next year. “I said to them I am not impressed with discussing anything else. We need to place workers in this country so that services can be rendered. I can confirm all of them will be working from 1 January.” Matsoso adds that a delay in the online application process this year, a concern raised by Judasa, is unacceptable.
