                                         HARARE - As Zimbabwe’s political future hangs in the balance, it’s now being reported that newly appointed provincial affairs minister has been arrested while trying to flee to South Africa. Zimbabwean media is reporting that Paul Chimedza was arrested on Thursday night at an army roadblock in Matabeleland. Chimedza was appointed in President Robert Mugabe’s latest Cabinet reshuffle. His arrest comes after the army said it would purge all criminals around Mugabe. Chimedza was reportedly arrested at a Zimbabwean army roadblock in the Bubi District. Armed troops are positioned in various points and routes, consistently conducting stop and searches on vehicles. Chimedza is the latest official to be arrested by the army since the beginning of the week when the army took control of the country and placed Mugabe under house arrest. Minister of Higher Education Jonathan Moyo, Minister of Finance Ignatius Chombo and Zanu-PF youth league leader Kudzanai Chipanga are also said to be behind bars.
