                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police in the North West have offered R100,000 reward to anyone with information on the whereabouts of missing Makajaneng resident Tebogo Ndlovu. He was last seen alive on a Mooinooi farm on 2 August when he and two others were shot for allegedly stealing oranges. Matthew Benson appeared in the Brits Magistrates Court on Tuesday on charges of attempted murder. The police's Sabata Mokgwabone said: “We can confirm that the police in the North West are offering a reward of up to a R100,000. We are urging anybody with information that can assist us to contact the investigating officer Lieutenant Colonel Tlhapi.” Benson will remain in custody until his next court appearance on 14 December. Two months ago, angry community members took to the streets – barricading roads with burning rubble and stoning passing motorists after the 24-year-old man and two of his friends were allegedly shot at by Benson on his father’s farm. While two men managed to escape unharmed, Ndlovu was allegedly wounded and left on the farm where his friends say they last saw him alive. It is suspected that he is no longer alive, yet his body has not been found.
