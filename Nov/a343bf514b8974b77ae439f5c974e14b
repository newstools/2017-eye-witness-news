                                         CAPE TOWN - A handful of Zimbabwean nationals have gathered at the country's embassy in Cape Town to celebrate the leadership change in the country. Zimbabwe's new president Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in on Friday, following former leader Robert Mugabe's resignation earlier this week. Car horns and loud cheers can be heard outside the Zimbabwean Embassy in Cape Town. A jubilant crowd of Zimbabwean nationals has gathered here to celebrate what they call the new democratic, post-Mugabe Zimbabwe. Event organiser Tendai Bhiza says she has renewed hope for the country. “I want people to unite and love one another despite what happened.” Bhiza, who’s been living in South Africa for the past 13 years, has called on the international community to support efforts to rebuild the country.
