                                         JOHANNESBURG - Lonmin  has denied reports that it plans to cut spending on social and labour projects, saying no decision has been made. The mining giant spent almost R300 million in the 2016 financial year on social and labour projects which covered a variety of costs including housing and human resource development. Lonmin has announced potential job cuts of over 1,000 employees before Christmas due to persistently low commodity prices and rising costs. The mine's Wendy Tlou said: “We’re looking at things that reduce capital expenditure, how we move our crews from one area, some of our business services project and how do we save energy.”
