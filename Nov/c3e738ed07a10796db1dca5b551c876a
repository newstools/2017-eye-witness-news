                                         JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s rand tumbled more than two percent on Friday, while bonds also weakened sharply as investors who had bought the assets cheap earlier in the week sold out, while firm US data also added pressure. Stocks were firmer, as companies that earn most of their revenue outside South Africa got a lift from the weaker currency as its boosts their rand-denominated earnings. At 15.00 GMT, the rand traded at 14.2575 per dollar, 2.05% weaker than its overnight close of 13.9725, accelerating its slide late in the session after US manufacturing data beat estimates and lifted the greenback. Traders said the rand was knocked by a combination of firmer US data and investors squaring short positions ahead of the weekend after the rand’s surprise rally to below the 14.00 technical mark earlier in the week. “We’re not seeing anything specific when it comes to flows locally or offshore. The rand traded up to the 14.25/35 level post-budget, now guys are taking some profits and selling rand-assets across the board,” a trader at a local bank said. The Treasury halved its 2017 growth estimate last week, forecast an expanded budget deficit at 4.3% and said public debt could reach 60% of GDP in the medium term. This shocked markets, triggering a sharp selloff. Government bonds also took a hit, with the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 jumping 24 basis points to 9.28%, its highest in one week. Currency dealer at TreasuryOne Phillip Pearce said the rand was mirroring the general weakness in other emerging markets currencies such as Turkey’s lira and Russia’s rouble. On the stock market, the benchmark Top-40 index was up 0.7% at 53,199 points, while the broader All-share index rose 0.5% to 59,638 points. Luxury goods group Richemont was the biggest gainer among the blue-chips, advancing 2.6% to R131.07, while global furniture retailer Steinhoff International gained 2.2% to R61.80. Shares in platinum producer Lonmin, which has its primary listing in London, fell 28.3% to R14 in Johannesburg. Lonmin shares lost more than a quarter of their value in the session after the mining company delayed its annual financial results because it could not yet give a specific figure for the impact of an ongoing business review.
