                                         LONDON - British newspapers are reporting Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are to be deployed as Commonwealth super envoys, visiting countries that Queen Elizabeth II feels no longer able to.  Her Majesty’s long haul travel has been severely cut back since she turned 90 and it’s thought she is keen to use the newly engaged couple’s popularity to strengthen Commonwealth ties.  Since the announcement of the engagement between the queen’s grandson Prince Harry and his girlfriend Meghan Markle, attention has begun to focus on what roles they might play in the royal family.  One suggestion is that Markle, with her African-American background, would be ideal to strengthen Commonwealth ties across South Africa, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  It’s thought that the monarchy is keen to capitalise on the pair’s immense popularity to cement links and trade deals.  It’s known that the 91-year-old queen is unlikely to make any or many future long haul flights, so devolving some of the responsibility would make a lot of sense. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
