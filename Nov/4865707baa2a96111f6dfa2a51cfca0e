                                         CAPE TOWN - A convicted cash-in-transit robber has been sentenced to 22 years behind bars.  Mbulelo Mbatyazwa was part of a gang that struck while G4S security guards were loading an ATM with cash at Nyanga Junction Mall in Manenberg in 2013. They threatened to shoot the guards and then fled with bags of cash. The armed robbers escaped during a shoot-out with police but officers managed to track down the 50-year-old near Gugulethu Mall. The sentencing comes as police and other law enforcement officials are on high alert for a potential spike in mall robberies and cash-in-transit heists during the festive season.
