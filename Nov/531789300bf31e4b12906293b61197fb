                                         DURBAN - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says its confident that all branch general meeting complaints will be resolved before the elective conference. The so-called ANC rebels claim a national dispute and resolution committee, which will be deployed to province, will be led by Naledi Pandor. The provincial ANC has refused to be drawn into commenting on whether it believes Pandor is “compromised” after being announced as Cyril Ramaphosa's running mate. The provincial ANC and the so-called rebels provide contradicting statements about how many appeals need to be dealt with in relation to the branch general meetings. This week the rebels claimed there were at least 80 complaints while the current executive says there are 30 that need to be dealt with. Provincial secretary Super Zuma says that six more were sent back from the national office earlier this week. “We can’t respond to allegations made by others on something we don’t know. As I indicated, we have about 30 appeals. We received six from head officer yesterday.” The court battle with the ANC rebels will be heard at the end of this month. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
