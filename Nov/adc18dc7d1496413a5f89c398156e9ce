                                         CAPE TOWN - The defence of wife killer Christopher Panayiotou has indicated they will seek leave to appeal his conviction. The Port Elizabeth businessman has on Friday been sentenced to life imprisonment  for hiring men to murder Jayde Panayiotou in April 2015. Co-accused Sinethemba Nenembe has also been handed a life sentence, while Zolani Sibeko gets a 15-year sentence for conspiracy to commit murder. In a post on the Justice for Jayde Facebook page, the deceased's sister asks for privacy. Toni Inggs has called on the public to understand that this is their time to mourn, to reminisce about the joyful times, and to begin to find a way to move forward with their lives. In the post, she says her family will be forever grateful for the support they've received from strangers, and she's thanked the public for giving them courage and strength to get through this difficult period. Judge Dayalin Chetty has found Panayiotou took no responsibility for his actions. Chetty says Panayiotou remained indifferent and defiant. Meanwhile, middleman, Luthando Siyoni, now also faces prosecution after reneging on a deal to turn State witness.
