                                         JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says it is worried its members will be unfairly chastised for their inability to report to work during an illegal strike at Harmony Gold's Kusasalethu Mine  in Carletonville. Workers failed to report on duty on Monday after the employer issued an ultimatum following a wildcat strike over the dismissal of six Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) branch leaders that started last Friday. There've been reports of arson and intimidation of those who don't participate in the stay away. The NUM's Livhuwani Mammburu said: “Harmony knows who’s responsible for this wildcat strike and they must deal with those people who are responsible for this strike. As the NUM, we distance ourselves. We’re just worried that our members are also going to be judged for not going to work.”
