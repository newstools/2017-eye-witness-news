                                         CAPE TOWN - Nelson Mandela Bay councillors are debating a motion of no confidence in Democratic Alliance (DA) Mayor Athol Trollip. The motion was proposed by Patriotic Alliance Provincial leader Marlon Daniels and seconded by the UDM's Mongameli Bobani. Bobani says Mayor Trollip is not taking charge amid mounting problems in the metro. He adds the issue of water cuts in communities remains a big concern for the citizens of Nelson Mandela Bay. “The people over the weekend, they don’t have water and I mean for five consecutive days.” The DA-led coalition with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has 59 seats and the opposition has 57. The EFF says its six council members will not support opportunist motions of no confidence brought by the ANC.
