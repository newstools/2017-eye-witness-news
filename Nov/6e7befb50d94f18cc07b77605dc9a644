                                         CAPE TOWN - The University of Cape Town's (UCT) Student Representative Council (SRC) says it has a problem with the Fees Commission report proposing free education for all Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) students. The Presidency released the Heher Commission report  early on Monday.  For TVET colleges, the commission has recommended all students receive fully subsidised free education in the form of grants that cover their full cost of study and that no student should be partially funded.  UCT SRC President Karabo Khakhau said: “The problem with this is you have a granting of free education for TVET college students. These TVET college students comprise of people who have the financial capacity to do so but are granted that on a blanket scale, while university students who are still suffering from the same mechanism are not addressed in that regard. This is something that is very problematic and is not progressive.”
