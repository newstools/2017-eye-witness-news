                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it won't hesitate to interdict any attempt by Energy Minister David Mahlobo to force through a nuclear deal.  Reports in the City Press suggest Mahlobo is set to go ahead with his nuclear power plans, despite Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba having said the country cannot afford the R1 trillion contract.  The paper is reporting that while the energy deal was set to be finalised in February 2018, it will now be completed in the next two weeks. The DA says its clear Mahlobo was appointed to make sure the nuclear deal would be pushed through.  The DA’s energy shadow minister Gordon Mackay says they won't allow Mahlobo to appease his Russian friends at the expense of millions of South Africans. “We are now expecting Mr Mahlobo to deliver a document which says nuclear will be urgently required by South Arica, which is blatantly untrue and we are concerned that the only way they can do that is to potentially fabricated public participation submissions that are oral or written in which to give voice to a need for nuclear.” The City Press is reporting that Mahlobo told the paper that while government should not be reckless, energy is central to the country's security and shouldn't be treated as an economic issue. Mahlobo says every day more companies are closing down and young people remain unemployed. He says the African National Congress must not be deterred by political parties which want to stop it from implementing its programmes. Mahlobo says the criticism against the nuclear project is based on unfounded narratives about who may win the tender. He says his department wants to ensure the security of energy that's sustainable and that the need for extra energy is legitimate.
