                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Liquor Board has fined Cubana in Fourways R150,000 for serving alcohol beyond 2am, in the wake on an early morning assault on two women by former Deputy Minister Mduduzi Manana at the establishment. Video footage showing Manana assaulting the women at the club in August went viral, leading to his resignation. Manana pleaded guilty in the Randburg magistrates court to three counts of assault with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm. WATCH: Manana pleads guilty  Now, Cubana has found itself foul of the law. Gauteng Economic Development MEC Lebogang Maile says that the club in Fourways contravened the Gauteng Liquor Act, which allows the sale of alcohol in nightclubs between the hours of 8am and 2am. Maile says that Cubana is not the only establishment contravening its licence conditions and the liquor board and police will be conducting random raids as the festive season draws closer.
