                                         JOHANNESBURG - Constitutional organisation Casac says the lack of governance and accountability under President Jacob Zuma’s administration is alarming and a judicial inquiry is imperative to uncover major corruption. Zuma denied receiving any payments from private companies or individuals during his presidency following allegations in a new book by Jacques Pauw that claims Zuma received a million rand per month for a year without declaring it to the South African Revenue Service (Sars). The president’s lawyers also filed responding papers this week, which state that Zuma will appoint a commission of inquiry into state capture if part of Thuli Madonsela’s report is aside. Casac says that Zuma is using every trick in the book to avoid being held accountable for his alleged involvement in state capture. Zuma wants to appoint his own commission and exclude his alleged wrongdoing from the scope of the investigation. The organisation’s Lawson Naidoo says that state capture is something that needs to be investigated, including Zuma’s alleged role. “This is a matter that I think the public demand attention on.” During a recent event in Rustenburg, Madonsela said that she submitted facts, not allegations, in the State of Capture report and the longer it takes to investigate, the easier it'll be to silence witnesses and shred documents, making this a cold case.
