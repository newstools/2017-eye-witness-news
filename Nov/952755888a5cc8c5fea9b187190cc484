                                         JOHANNESBURG - Black First, Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama has called on Johannesburg residents to shut down the city to end all land evictions. Addressing the community of Orange Farm on Sunday, Mngxitama said South Africans cannot continue to be forced out of the land all the time. Earlier this week, the Johannesburg Metro Police evicted community members who have invaded land in the area. The BLF is accusing the Democratic Alliance-led government in the Johannesburg Metro of trying to get rid of black people in the city. BLF deputy president Zanele Lwana said: “We are extending the call to black people for the shutdown of the City of Johannesburg because the city is in the hands of a white racist party, which is trying to rid the city of black people.” The BLF has also condemned the city for its continued evictions of people from hijacked buildings in the CBD.
