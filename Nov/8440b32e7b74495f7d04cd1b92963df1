MEC Gwen Ramokgopa says many inconsistencies in the health system have been exposed by the Esidimeni tragedy. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa says the newly appointed team of experts will help overcome the leadership crisis faced by the department. The team, appointed by Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Gauteng Premier David Makhura, is set to strengthen the provincial health management and systems. The provincial department has recently been beset by several challenges which were heightened by the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Following the health ombudsman recommendations, the province has been working closely with the national Health Department to implement and ensure the public health system in Gauteng functions optimally. Ramokgopa says many inconsistencies in the health system have been exposed by the Esidimeni tragedy. “If you don’t accountable those in the leadership and in the service, you’re likely to have problems like the one we have with the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Since assuming responsibility with the acting HOD, what I found was that the performance management system in the department was not effective, especially at the senior level, from director level upwards.” The team will be led by former Treasury official Michael Sachs.
