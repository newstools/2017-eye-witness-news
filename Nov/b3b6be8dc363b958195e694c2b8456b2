                                         CAPE TOWN - Yet another ambulance crew has been targeted by criminals in Cape Town. The Western Cape Health Department confirmed armed men tried to hijack an ambulance crew at the Mfuleni day hospital on Thursday. The attackers fled empty handed after they were confronted by community members. Western Cape Emergency Medical Services' Robert Daniels says police later assisted the paramedics. “Police escorted them out of the area. Mfuleni has been declared a red zone until 1pm on Friday, meaning all EMS crews require police escorts into the area.” Recently, paramedics were also robbed on the N2. Seven-year-old Faigon Wildschut was being transported to Red Cross Children's Hospital when the emergency vehicle was forced off the road and robbed by armed assailants. The boy eventually reached the hospital, but he was declared dead before noon. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
