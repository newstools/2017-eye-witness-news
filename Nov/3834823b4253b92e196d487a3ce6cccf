                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Mamelodi Sundowns duo of Percy Tau and Denis Onyango have been nominated for two prestigious CAF awards for 2017. The pair is in the running for the CAF African Player of the Year award for their performances in the Champions League this year. Sundowns, who were the defending champions of the competition, were knocked out by Wydad Casablanca in the quarter-finals back in September. It’s not the first CAF award nomination for Onyango, he won the CAF African Player of the Year Based in Africa award last year after helping Downs win the 2016 Champions League. The shot-stopper is also in the running for that same award this year, along with Tau and the Supersport United pair of Dean Furman and Jeremy Brockie. Furman and Brockie stand a better chance of winning the award, as Matsatsantsa are now in the CAF Confederation Cup final, where they will face TP Mazembe later this month. Brockie is arguably the front-runner to win the African Based Player accolade, considering he’s the top goal scorer in the Confed cup this year with 10 goals, four more than his closest competitors. The awards ceremony will take place on 4 January 2018 in Accra, Ghana.
