                                         PARYS – African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte says the party has taken a decision to give the power back to the branches promising that it will be impossible to rig the upcoming conference. Duarte was speaking during the free state general council which will nominate is a presidential candidate. She says the power now rests with branches. “We have a resolution which we’re implementing which gave the power back to the branches at the NGC [national general council] in 2015. Let me tell you, it is impossible to rig this particular conference because as you went to your branches, made your nominations and put it in an envelope, that envelope will only be opened here today.”
