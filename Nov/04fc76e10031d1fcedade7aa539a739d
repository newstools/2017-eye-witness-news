                                         JOHANNESBURG - SuperSport United have it all to do in their second leg CAF Confederations Cup Final encounter with TP Mazembe on Saturday.  Matsatsantsa go into the match trailing 2-1, following the first leg defeat in Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo last weekend. Goals from Traore and Daniel Adjei Nii gave the men from the DRC the advantage, but importantly for SuperSport, youngster Sipho Mbude scored the all-important away goal.  Brockie says that it is important not to give Traore too much space: “A lot revolves around him and Mazembe are a very direct team, and if you give him time and space, he brings the ball down nicely and brings other attacking players into the game.”  The New Zealand born striker also says that they must nullify the supply to Traore.  “It’s going to be important to cut the supply into him, that’s half the job done, then we just have to focus on what we have to do.”  SuperSport are chasing the club’s first piece of continental silverware.  The match at the Lucas Moripe Stadium kicks off at 8.15pm.
