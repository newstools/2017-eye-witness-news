DA leader Mmusi Maimane is expected to lead the march in Johannesburg in support of the coalition government lead by Mashaba. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) is expected to march to the Johannesburg City Council on Thursday morning as Mayor Herman Mashaba and Speaker Vasco da Gama are set to face a motion of no confidence today. The African National Congress (ANC) was pushing for the motion to be heard urgently on Wednesday, claiming that the city is on the brink of a financial collapse under Mashaba’s leadership. DA leader Mmusi Maimane is expected to lead the march in Johannesburg in support of the coalition government lead by Mashaba. On Wednesday, the ANC failed to get the motion on the agenda, with the council meeting dealing with other municipal issues first. Mashaba says he’s not fazed by today's motion against him. “I was elected by 52% of council to be the Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg.” While the ANC claims the city has been mismanaged under Mashaba, the Johannesburg mayor says he’s been inundated with cases of corruption since taking office.
