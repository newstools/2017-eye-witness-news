                                         CAPE TOWN - The country's maritime sector could create one million jobs by 2033. This emerged at a South African International Maritime Institute conference being held in Cape Town. The event brings together industry players, government stakeholders and education providers, to examine the impact of technology on the education and training of the country's future maritime workforce. The institute's Sam Venter says that the industry has the potential to develop skills. “We would like the outcome to give us a road map of sorts on what we need to do to adapt curriculums and skills courses to ensure learners are equipped for this technological world of tomorrow.” Maritime experts have warned that the rapid pace of technological growth is a factor that could produce serious skills development challenges and opportunities for South Africa's maritime economy. Venter says that the skills development also needs to keep up with the global digital demand. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
