                                         CAPE TOWN - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba  says it's important to address concerns raised about the South African Revenue Service (Sars) and whether they are based on truth or not. Gigaba was addressing the media on his request to the president to establish an inquiry into the revenue service to look into tax revenue challenges. He says President Jacob Zuma has given the green light to this enquiry, while commissioner Tom Moyane has agreed to cooperate. Gigaba says the inquiry has the duty to look into ways to improve the capacity of Sars if need be. He says concerns that have been raised about the revenue service cannot be ignored. “Whether founded on fact or not, it is important that we should not be dismissive of such concerns, but we look into them by engaging dedicated teams of experts.” Gigaba says factors contributing to the under collection of tax will also be looked into. “There could also be other factors such as weakening tax morality. It is important for us to look at other ways that may need to be taken in order to improve the capacity.” Gigaba has appealed that the enquiry should not be pre-empted and for the process to take its course.
