The Road Accident Scheme that will replace the Road Accident Fund is set to compensate all victims of accidents irrespective of who is at fault. CAPE TOWN - A new bill that will change the way that victims of road accidents are compensated, is currently open for public debate. The Road Accident Scheme that will replace the Road Accident Fund is set to compensate all victims of accidents, irrespective of who is at fault. A road crash victim will be entitled to claim medical, family support and funeral benefits immediately. It’s anticipated that the claims process will be much less cumbersome than is currently the case under the Road Accident Fund, which will be phased out over a number of years. Chairperson of Parliament’s Transport Committee, Dikeledi Magadzi says: “The Road Accident Benefit Scheme is taking its cue from what the Accident Fund has been doing and improving certain things on how this thing should be operationalised.” The public has until the end of the month to make written submissions to Parliament, before public hearings commence.
