                                         HARARE - Zimbabwe’s former finance minister Ignatius Chombo is due to apply for bail on Monday in a case that’s being closely watched for signs of how the new government will treat its political enemies. Chombo was detained nearly two weeks ago when the army seized control in Zimbabwe. The former finance minister was an ally of Grace Mugabe and many will read a dire warning into how he's being treated now. He's fabulously rich, having allegedly obtained land in Harare at bargain prices that he went on to develop during his time in power. He's been untouchable for years. But with the fall of Grace and President Robert Mugabe, he's lost his backers and appeared in court in leg irons on Saturday. State media says the second official due to apply for bail today is Kudzai Chipanga, a former youth leader who organised rallies for Mugabe and his wife.
