                                         JOHANNESBURG - While Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has described his party’s relationship with the Democratic Alliance (DA) as a marriage of convenience, he’s accused the opposition party of representing what he calls “the apartheid Israel”. While addressing supporters outside the Israeli embassy in Pretoria on Thursday, Malema said the EFF voting with the DA doesn’t mean the red berets support the party. DA leader Mmusi Maimane came under heavy criticism from various quarters for his visit to Israel in 2016, while the opposition said it supports the grievances of the people of Palestine.

It’s a marriage of convenience because DA represents apartheid Israel in South Africa.” He says his party is passing time with the DA. “It’s like a person you date after breaking up with your genuine girlfriend. DA is a rebound.” Malema says the only reason his party is cooperating with the DA is because it's waiting to meet its real lover.  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
