                                         JOHANNESBURG - The family of a child who drowned at an exposed construction site in Orange Farm is demanding answers from the construction company and the area’s councillor. Thulani Sibeko and a friend died last week while trying to retrieve house keys that had fallen into a hole filled with water. The children were aged nine and 10 years-old. Sibeko’s family says that the pit has been exposed for almost three months. Spokesperson Lungile Sibeko says that they want whoever was responsible for the construction site to account. “He knows that the people that got the tender is someone from Mpumalanga. People in the area were also very mad, asking why would they hire someone out of the province. This person probably doesn’t even come to check how the project is managed.”
