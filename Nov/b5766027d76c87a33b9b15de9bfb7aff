The police have also circulated a photo of Ali Zira, who is a wanted criminal associated with the 2014 killing of a prominent businessman in the coastal town of Malindi.   According to the security agencies, Zira and two accomplices shot Ahmed Bakshwen three times in the head while in his car, an attack that was later linked to the al-Shabaab terror group.
