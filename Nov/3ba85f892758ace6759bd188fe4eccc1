                                         CAPE TOWN - A three-year-old child wounded in a gang shooting in Elsies River is scheduled to undergo surgery this week. The girl was struck in the mouth by a stray bullet. A gang member in his 30s was killed in the shooting in Leonsdale last week. The child remains in the Intensive Care Unit at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. Last week she was in a critical condition but hospital officials say her condition has improved. Community safety MEC Dan Plato has told Eyewitness News the shooting was between two rival gangs in the area fighting over drug turf. Plato says it highlights the need for the deployment of the South African National Defence Force in Cape Town's gang-riddled communities. “The ongoing shootings is becoming a nightmare on the Cape Flats and that’s why the premier and I and the whole of the Western Cape Cabinet support the deployment of the army.” There have been no arrests.
