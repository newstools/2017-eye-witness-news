                                         JOHANNESBURG - Soshanguve and Mabopane residents say they hope motorists will obey the rules of the road following the successful road safety campaign in the north of Pretoria. Residents descended to the R80, Mabopane Highway, to light candles to seek spiritual interventions and pray for no accidents ahead of the festive season. The event organiser John Molepo says the community is concerned about the high number of road accidents on the main road linking Tshwane’s northern townships with the capital. “We saw a need, as a community, to come and seek spiritual intervention however we’re also been doing a campaign for road safety as an attempt to reduce the number of accidents in our society.” City of Tshwane’s environmental MMC Mike Mkhari says the metro is supporting the road safety initiative. “We need to start by taking care of ourselves on the roads. These are public roads, so we need to make sure that we comply.”
