                                         CAPE TOWN - Energy Minister David Mahlobo and Eskom have given their undertaking to the Western Cape High Court that no nuclear power will be procured without a lawful determination by the minister. Earthlife Africa and the Southern Africa Faith Communities Environment Institute returned to court on Wednesday morning for an urgent interdict, saying that recent utterances by Mahlobo led them to believe that he was rushing through a nuclear deal.  Earthlife Africa and the Faith communities Environment Institute say they are concerned that government is planning to speed up the procurement of nuclear power.  In April, the Western Cape High Court ruled in their favour that five of government’s nuclear cooperation agreements were invalid. The two organisation’s have now scored another victory.  The Energy Minister and Eskom have committed - in affidavits to the court - to follow due process before taking steps to procure nuclear power. This includes the concurrence of the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) that nuclear power is required, and only after a fair public participation process has been followed.  The matter has now been indefinitely postponed, making it possible for the applicants to return to court if they feel the undertakings have been breached.
