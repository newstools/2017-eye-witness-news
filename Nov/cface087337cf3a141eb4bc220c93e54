                                         CAPE TOWN – Germany’s top court on Wednesday ruled lawmakers must legally recognise a “third gender” from birth. Once the order is signed into law, Germany would become the first European country to offer intersex people the option of identifying as a designation other than male or female. The court ruled that the current system, which “does not provide for a third option besides the entry ‘female’ or ‘male’” is unconstitutional. In 2013, Germany became the first European country to allow parents of intersex children to leave the gender box blank on a birth certificate. CNN reports the court said the new legislation must be in force by 31 December.
