                                         CAPE TOWN - Weather monitoring technology will be acquired to better assess weather conditions around Robben Island.  This follows an investigation into an incident in September where a ferry, carrying 60 passengers, started sinking while returning from a trip to the island.  A rescue operation was carried out and everyone on board were brought to safety.  The South African Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa)’s preliminary report found the skipper was unaware of prevailing weather conditions and was then overcome by rough seas. Robben Island CEO Mava Dada says: “Our arrangements with regards to weather conditions is that the skipper knows and understands their boat and they’re the people who are supposed to make a call on whether that boat is able to sail after confirming with our head of heritage.”
