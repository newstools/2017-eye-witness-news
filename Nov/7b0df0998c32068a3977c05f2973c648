                                         JOHANNESBURG- The Blitzbok 7's squad is the most experienced squad assembled ahead of the opening HSBC World Sevens Series tournament in Dubai.  The squad sees the return of former captain Kyle Brown and Justin Geduld who have had lengthy injury lay-offs. Seabelo Senatla and Kwagga Smith are also back after missing six tournaments last season due to Super Rugby commitments with the Stormers and Lions respectively.  The average number of tournaments per player in the squad is 37, which is the most for any Blitzbok squad ever assembled for the World Series Tournament.  Philip Snyman retains the Captains armband for the series again.  Powell says that they are fortunate to have an experienced squad at their disposal.  “Despite blooding a handful of new guys last year, we still have the benefit of a really solid squad. We were blessed with the lack of injuries, especially as a few the players had a stint in fifteens as well.” The Blitzbok 7’s squad for Dubai is as follows:
