                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) general-secretary Gwede Mantashe says there will be no extensions to the deadline for nominations ahead of the December elective conference. Mantashe says as far as the party is concerned, branches should be done with their general meetings by 15 November. He was speaking to journalists at the St George’s Hotel in Irene where ANC’s special NEC meeting has convened. Mantashe says over 60% of branches have already concluded with their general meetings and expects those remaining to be done by the end of the week. He says provinces are working towards the target date. “We’re pushing the provinces to finish the branch general meetings by 15 November. We’ve not decided to extend the time for the branch general meetings.” When asked about whether the pronouncement of slates would be on the agenda- he had this to say. “It’s not on the agenda. You can’t predict what will be said nor can you say they will not discuss it.” ANC Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa last weekend pronounced the names of NEC members he would prefer to serve within the party’s top six should he be elected president. The special NEC meeting is expected to continue until Monday.
