                                         CAPE TOWN - The Speakerâ€™s office is considering whether a question about payments that Jacob Zuma allegedly received from a private company after he became president should be included in his oral reply session on Thursday. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has asked for the urgent question to be put on the order paper, arguing that the allegations cannot go untested. It was reported at the weekend that Zuma allegedly received around R1 million a month from Royal Security, a company linked to his friend and African National Congres (ANC) benefactor Roy Moodley. The allegation is contained in author and journalist Jacques Pauw's new book, The President's Keepers. The DA says that the "explosive revelations" came to light only after the deadline for submitting questions expired. The party says that South Africans need to know whether Zuma was on the payroll of a private security company, headed up by a welathy friend and party benefactor. The question that the DA wants to ask is whether or not Zuma received any payments from Roy Moodley or his company, Royal Security, at any time since he became president in May 2009 and if so, what are the details. The party says that this is the last opportunity to put the question to Zuma until at least March next year, and that South Africans cannot wait until then on a matter of such importance. Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli has confirmed receipt of the DA's request.
