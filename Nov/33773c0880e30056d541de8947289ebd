                                         BERLIN - Tottenham Hotspur and England forward Harry Kane wants to spend his entire career at the London club, he told Germany’s Bild newspaper on Sunday. “My aim is to play my whole career only for Tottenham,” Kane, who is reportedly a major transfer target for the biggest European clubs but whose current deal with Spurs runs to 2022, told the newspaper. “At the moment, everything fits well for me here and I am happy. We have a fantastic team, a good coach and a professional training centre and we are getting a new stadium as well.” Kane, Premier League Golden Boot winner for the last two seasons, has scored eight more league goals this season with Tottenham currently in fourth place. Tottenham’s squad, with a young English core of Kane, Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Danny Rose, Harry Winks and Kieran Trippier, certainly appears to offer a sustainable future. Promoting home-grown youngsters into the first team is a matter of pride for coach Mauricio Pochettino, who was equally impressive on that front while in charge at Southampton, but Kane’s rise is a particular source of pride for supporters. The 24-year-old, who arrived at the club as an 11-year-old back in 2004, has also scored five times in the Champions League, with Tottenham having qualified for the knockout stage with two games to spare. They travel to Borussia Dortmund next week with the Germans all but eliminated from the competition.
