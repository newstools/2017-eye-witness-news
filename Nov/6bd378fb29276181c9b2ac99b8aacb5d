                                         CAPE TOWN - Opposition parties say that those who deliberately jeopardised an agreement with the Post Office for the payment of grants should be held accountable. Treasury has found that the South African Social Security Agency  was biased in crafting a request for a proposal and that it unfairly disqualified the Post Office from parts of the tender. A task team has now been set up to oversee the negotiation process and an agreement is expected to be reached by next week Friday. MPs say that Parliament must get to the bottom of who has been manipulating the negotiation process with the Post Office. The DA’s Lindy Wilson says: “We need to know why and who manipulated the system and what is being done about it, and who is being held accountable.” But the ANC’s Rose Capa disagrees: “It was not necessary to identify mischief makers, but for us to be able to go forward.” However, the EFF’s Ntombovuyo Mente called for an investigation. “The Hawks must investigate who is the person who wants to hold the state at ransom.” The IFP’s Mkhuleko Hlengwa concurred.  “We are dealing with a criminal element which was deliberately designed to derail this process.” The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) says that it wants to see the agreement between Sassa and the Post Office within the next two weeks.
