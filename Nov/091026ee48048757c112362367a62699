                                         JOHANNESBURG - Religious leaders have raised concern about the country's poor marginalised and unemployed population during a National Day of Prayer. Thousands attended the gathering hosted by the Motsepe Foundation at the FNB Stadium on Sunday. Among them were African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopefuls Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Zweli Mkhize along with opposition leaders Mmusi Maimane and Mosiuoa Lekota. Religious leaders have highlighted the problems caused by a lack of political and economic stability.  Father Paul Tatu of the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference, who was there, says it’s not just up to government to turn things around. “To influence other people who are doing well, who are rich in our society but you know they need to share in different forms the richness they have.”
