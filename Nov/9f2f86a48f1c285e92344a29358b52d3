                                         JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) plans a coal sector strike after wage negotiations with mining firms became deadlocked, it said on Wednesday, without giving a date for industrial action. NUM spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu said the union had been granted a strike certificate by a government mediator, which is an important requirement before downing tools. Mammburu has accused the Chamber of Mines of negotiating in bad faith. “This afternoon, we have received a certificate to go on strike in the coal sector and negotiations between the NUM and the Chamber of Mines have officially collapsed; with the issuing of a non-resolution to the dispute by the CCMA.” A protracted strike in the coal sector could affect power supply in Africa’s most industrialised economy, as about 85% of it is generated from the fossil fuel.
