                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Economic Opportunities and Agriculture Department says there've been no new reported bird flu infections in the province this week. It signals a possible positive turning point for the industry. There have been 63 confirmed cases of avian influenza in the province with no new infections reported at commercial farms since 18 October. Over two million commercial poultry have been culled, most of them, hens who lay eggs. The department's Bronwynne Jooste says authorities will now focus on rebuilding the poultry industry. “Vets are still investigating a small number of suspected cases but the infection rate still does appear to be slowing down. The focus for animal technicians right now is to support farmers to make sure that their poultry houses are clear so they can start the restocking process.”
