                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng police are warning against vigilantism after six people were killed in Diepsloot  on Saturday. The group was allegedly assaulted and burned to death after residents accused them of terrorising the community.  One man was rescued from the angry mob. The police's Kay Makhubele says they've noticed a growing trend in mob attacks. “We condemn that and also we request from our community that if there are any criminal activities which are taking place to work hand in hand with the police so that we can arrest those criminal elements rather than to take the law into our own hands.”
