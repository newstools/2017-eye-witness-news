The NSRI says in 2016, 2,000 people died due to fatal drownings in the country while 20,000 non-fatal drownings were recorded in the same year. CAPE TOWN - With the festive season upon us, holidaymakers are being advised to be safe when they visit the beach. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) says in 2016, 2,000 people died due to fatal drownings in the country while 20,000 non-fatal drownings were recorded in the same year. The NSRI is launching an emergency floatation campaign using Pink Torpedo Buoys. These brightly coloured rescue devices will help lifeguards during the hot summer months. The devices are bright making it easy to spot someone who might be in distress. NSRI spokesperson Andrew Ingram said: “We’re concentrating on riptides, Plettenberg Bay and Wilderness area as well as a couple of other spots that are well known for people getting into difficulty.”
