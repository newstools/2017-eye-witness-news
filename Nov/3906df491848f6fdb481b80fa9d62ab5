                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament wants answers from South African Revenue Service (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane on the reinstatement of Jonas Makwakwa, who is set to return to work after a lengthy suspension and a probe into suspicious payments into his account. Law firm Hogan Lovells recommended a disciplinary hearing.  Sars says that the report by its chairperson, advocate Terry Motau, has cleared Makwakwa of all charges. In a report to Sars in May last year, the Financial Intelligence Centre flagged a number of large deposits into bank accounts linked to Makwakwa and another Sars employee, Kelly-Ann Elskie. Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance has asked Moyane and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba for a copy of the report that clears Makwakwa of all charges. Chairperson Yunus Carrim says: “There should be a full report in the public domain. It’s particularly important because Sars is being challenged in many respects and we need confidence in it. It’s in its own interests that it releases the report.” Sars is due to appear before the committee on 28 November to present its annual financial report delayed because of a dispute with the Auditor-General over the payment of bonuses, over which Sars threatened to haul the AG to court.
