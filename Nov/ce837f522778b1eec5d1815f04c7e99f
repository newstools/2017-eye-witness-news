                                         JOHANNESBURG – The National Health Education & Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) has promised more protests at the International Relations Department in Pretoria until government completely cuts ties with Israel.  Several pro-Palestinian organisations joined a protest in the capital on Tuesday, accusing government of betraying the Palestinian struggle by what it calls “continuously strengthening ties with Israel”. Nehawu’s Khaya Xaba says they can no longer remain silent as government continues to strengthen relations with Israel. “We took the fight to Dirco to say that enough is enough. They must stop with relations with apartheid Israel. What they are doing is contrary to government policies. It is also contrary to the ANC’S resolution on the issue.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
