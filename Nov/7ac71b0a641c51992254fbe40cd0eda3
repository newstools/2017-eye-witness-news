                                         JOHANNESBURG - Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu says he prays that South African’s are shaken up and awakened to remember that all citizens are members of one family. Dozens are gathered at FNB Stadium for a National Day of Prayer, calling on all South Africans to unite. Traditional leaders and many faith-based organisations are among delegates praying over the state of the country and the economy African National Congress presidential hopefuls including Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Zweli Mkhize and Lindiwe Sisulu are also expected to attend. Tutu says a few have become very rich while a large majority have remained in the bondage of poverty. “Let us leave here inspired, determined to live as who we really are; members of one family, God’s family, the human family.” Religious leaders at the event say the political instability in South Africa is deeply worrying. Father Paul Tatu of the Southern African Catholic Bishops’ Conference says these prayers are mostly for those who remain marginalised in society.
