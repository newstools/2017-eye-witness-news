                                         CAPE TOWN - Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown says she has no plans of resigning in the wake of growing allegations of state capture at parastatals. She’s also denied that any of her close associates or family members are doing business with state-owned companies in her portfolio, saying allegations in the media are untested. Brown was due to answer questions on state capture during question time in the National Assembly on Wednesday but has been booked off sick for a month. In a written response to a question from the Democratic Alliance, Brown says state-owned enterprises are in a better position now than when she took over the portfolio. Their asset base has increased from R750 million in 2014 to more than R1 trillion. Brown says she’s called for a judicial commission of inquiry on more than 10 occasions to get to the root of tender and contract management issues at Eskom  and Transnet. She’s also instituted investigations at these parastatals as a firm stance against corruption. On a question from the Economic Freedom Fighters, Brown has reiterated the position she held at Parliament’s Eskom inquiry last week, that she’s never asked the executives of any state-owned company to give business to anybody, saying it would be unethical to do so.
