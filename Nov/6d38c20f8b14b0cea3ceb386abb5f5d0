                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the former Treasury’s budget chief Michael Sachs has accepted the offer of a transfer from the National Treasury to the Gauteng provincial government. He says Sachs will be joining his office as the Deputy Director General responsible for performance monitoring and evaluation.  Sachs, who’s been with National Treasury since 2008, resigned this week over alleged interference by President Jacob Zuma. Makhura says sachs will immediately help to stabilise the finances of the Gauteng Department of Health, which poses a major risk at the moment. Makhura’s spokesperson Phumla Sekhonyane says, “The Premier has spoken to the Minister of Finance, who has confirmed that he’s attending to the Premier’s request for the transfer of Mr Sachs.  He will, thereafter, focus on monitoring and fast-tracking of spending on infrastructure budget by the Gauteng departments as well as municipalities.”
