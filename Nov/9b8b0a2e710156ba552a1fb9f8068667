                                         JOHANNESBURG - Australia cricket vice-captain David Warner  says that he will be fit and ready to play in the first Ashes Test against England on Thursday. The explosive opening batsman pulled out of a net session on Tuesday after facing just two balls due to a sore neck. Warner says he will not miss the opening Test. “No, I don’t think that a sore neck will keep me out of the match,” he says. He did, however, admit that the pain in his neck is quite severe and he will get treatment for it. “The pain is quite sore, but I’ll get a heat patch on it and some fingers through it tonight and see how I feel tomorrow.” The first of five Ashes Tests get underway 2am South African time on Thursday morning at the Gabba in Brisbane.
