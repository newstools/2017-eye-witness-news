                                         JOHANNESBURG - Security staff at OR Tambo International Airport  have found three bricks of cocaine believed to be linked to Friday’s arrest of a woman who had the drug concealed in her underwear. The airport says the drugs were found at the bottom of a sanitary bin in the women’s bathroom. It was established that the packages containing 1.34 kilograms of cocaine were wrapped in the same material as the other package, which was confiscated from a Seychelles-bound passenger. She was arrested at the security checkpoint when her body appeared to be in an unusual shape. Airport Spokesperson Leigh Gunkel-Keuler said: “I must say for our staff it is always pleasing when simply doing their work in the normal way yields the right results. We are also especially pleased to see in this incident a practical demonstration of the training that all staff including cleaning contractors receive at the airport.”
