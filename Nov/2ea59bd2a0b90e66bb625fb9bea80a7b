                                         JOHANNESBURG - A photograph has emerged of Police Minister Fikile Mbalula posing among several men who are claimed to be Crime Intelligence officers who have been assigned specifically to work for him.  News24 has released an edited version of the picture to protect the identities of the officers.  Eyewitness News revealed earlier on Monday that the minister has been accused of political interference in the strategic unit by issuing instruction directly to its divisional commissioner. It’s being alleged that a group of eight Crime Intelligence operatives has been assigned to Minister Mbalula and travel everywhere with him.  News24 reports that the officers are from Cape Town.  The Police Ministry’s Vuyo Mhaga has denied that the minister has his own Crime Intelligence team assigned to him, saying the picture was taken at an operation.  Mhaga says exposing the identifies of the officers would put their lives in danger.  Meanwhile, the ministry has denied Mbalula has interfered in the operations of Crime Intelligence, or that he has issued instructions directly to its divisional commissioner.
