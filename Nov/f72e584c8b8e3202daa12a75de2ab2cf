                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has distanced itself from remarks made by its board spokesperson Khulani Qoma and suspended head of legal Suzanne Daniels about allegations of state capture at the parastatal. Qoma told MPs on Tuesday that Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown is an “atrocious” minister who’s continuously taken irrational decisions to the detriment of the utility's reputation. In a statement released late on Tuesday afternoon, Eskom’s chairman Zethembe Khoza says Qoma’s utterances are not part of the organisation’s culture. “There have been several witnesses that have been called to give their testimonies who have clearly represented their own interests at the expense of the organisation and the country at large,” Khoza said. She added: “We understand that Eskom will be given an opportunity to make a formal presentation at the Parliamentary inquiry where it will give an honest, transparent and truthful account of events.”
