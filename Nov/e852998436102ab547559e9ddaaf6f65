                                         JOHANNESBURG - The union representing security guards at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital has demanded the facility terminate its contract with a security company and hire the guards directly. Workers barricaded the entrances to the hospital with burning tires and barbed wire earlier on Monday. Workers affiliated to the Academic and Professional Staff Association (APSA) are protesting over salary payments. Secretary general of APSA Boitumelo Senokoane says they are meeting with hospital management and the owners of the born to protect security company with the hope of terminating the contract. “First, we’re able to resolve the non-payment of workers which is long overdue. Secondly, to deal with the termination of the contract.” He says if they are not pleased with the outcome of the meeting they will take other action. “We were sending a warning to the hospital management and if they don’t come to the party, starting from tomorrow, we’re going to completely shut down.” Senokoane says the ultimate goal is to have the workers insourced.
