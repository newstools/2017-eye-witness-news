                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the province has established a special police unit focused on dealing with the scourge of women and child abuse.  Makhura launched the provincial 16 days of activism for no violence against women and children campaign at the Huntersfield Stadium in Katlehong, under the theme ‘Together, Making Gauteng City Region a Safer Place for Women and Children’. He has encouraged families to come forward and report the rape and abuse of children as perpetrators are often known. “This specialised unit of the police has been quite successful with arrests and prosecutions. It is not enough to have the police, yes catching the perpetrators are important but that’s not enough.” Makhura has called on all stakeholders to be involved and tackle the fight against gender-based violence. The national activism campaign was officially launched on Saturday morning, where President Jacob Zuma withdrew his attendance shortly after the event started. The Democratic Alliance has criticised Zuma, saying it's a sign the African National Congress is dead. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
