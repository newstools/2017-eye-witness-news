Scores of taxi drivers have marched on the minister's offices in Pretoria to hand over a memorandum. JOHANNESBURG - The National Taxi Alliance (NTA) has threatened further disruptions if Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi does not respond adequately to its demands. Scores of taxi drivers have marched on the minister's offices in Pretoria to hand over a memorandum.  They want the scrapping of the Aarto bill, which seeks to stop drivers from renewing their operators’ licences and are also demanding a subsidy. The drivers are now expected to continue with their march to the Union Buildings. Among the NTA’s demands, is the increase of the scrapping allowance of minibus taxis from R80,000 to R153,000.  The alliance also wants indefinite taxi operating licences instead of having to renew them every three months or yearly. The drivers' union president, Mohanoa Masitsa, says that if the Transport Minister fails to respond within three weeks, there’ll be an even bigger strike. He also warns if the Aarto bill is signed into law, taxi operators will lose their business, meaning another spike in the unemployment rate. Follow EWN's live blog on the taxi strike in Gauteng.
