                                         CAPE TOWN - There are currently four fires burning along the Outeniqua Mountains. The fire broke out in the area on Thursday. The Garden Route National Parks Nandi Mgwadlamba says fire crews are monitoring the Outeniqua Mountains. “There is a joint operating team attending to the fires, which includes Working on Fire and other partners. It is very difficult to fly over the area to assess the extent of the fire because of the low cloud cover and fog in the area.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
