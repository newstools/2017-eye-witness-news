                                         HARARE - Axed Zanu-PF leader Robert Mugabe is expected to make a public announcement shortly after his expulsion. The Zimbabwean army took over government earlier this week, confining the 93-year-old leader to his home. Hundreds of Zimbabweans took to the streets on Saturday, calling for Mugabe’s removal. Just hours after the Zanu-PF fired Mugabe from the party, state run broadcaster ZBC has announced that there’ll be a public address soon. The party’s Patrick Chinamasa announced earlier on Sunday that Mugabe had been given until midday on Monday to resign from the presidency. Reuters is reporting that Mugabe has agreed to step down.
