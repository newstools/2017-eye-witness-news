                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Social Development Department  has revealed that children as young as eight have approached a newly opened substance abuse clinic in Ekurhuleni.  MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza  officially launched the Alra Park Community Clinic on Friday which will offer rehabilitation and integration services to addicts in Nigel on the East Rand.  The MEC says the young children could not be admitted as the centre caters for people aged between 18 and 35. But she says alternative arrangements were made. “The centre manager shared with us this morning that some parents brought children as young as eight and nine years. So yes, substance abuse is really a big problem in the community. The solution is to prevent drug abuse from happening.”
