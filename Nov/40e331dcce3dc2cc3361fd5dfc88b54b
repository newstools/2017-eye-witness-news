                                         JOHANNESBURG - The SABC has denied claims that a payout out made to acting group chief executive officer Nomsa Philiso is dubious and says reports suggesting this are malicious. The City Press is reporting that the public broadcaster struggled to explain a bonus payout of almost R900,000 to Philiso. The SABC, however, claims the amount was accumulated over time and dated back to when she headed the commercial enterprises department that deals with sales and advertising. The broadcaster also says it is not true that the payout was a bonus as it’s a commission. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said, “By virtue of being here since 2011 she was part of this scheme for all employees. When money is allocated to you, part of it is banked then you’re given [the money] at a later stage.”
