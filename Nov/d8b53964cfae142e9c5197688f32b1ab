                                         CAPE TOWN - A 65-year-old heart recipient says donating an organ is the best gift a human being can give another. Evance Kalula underwent a heart transplant almost five years ago. The University of Cape Town law professor has urged South Africans to register as organ and tissue donors, following a 40% drop in the number of heart transplants. The issue has been highlighted on the birthdate of the late Professor Christiaan Barnard  who performed the world's first heart transplant on the 3 December 1967. Kalula says his donated heart has afforded him more time to spend with his wife and four children. He calls it the greatest gift he's received from a complete stranger. His heart failed on the 12 December 2012. And because it was an emergency, he received a transplant only a week later once a donor had been found. “I wouldn’t be alive; it is an incredible gift to give at a very critical time. I have been very lucky and my message would be please consider helping somebody else.” The identity of Kalula's donor is protected by confidentiality, but he knows he received a woman's heart. The Organ Donor Foundation  says in 2000, 41 heart transplants were conducted. Last year there were just 25. There are currently about 4,000 South Africans on waiting lists.
