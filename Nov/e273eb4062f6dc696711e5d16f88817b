                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) says the State Security Agency's threats against author Jacques Pauw and his publisher is a violation of the freedom to expose acts of corruption. Pauw's new book The President's Keepers contains allegations against President Jacob Zuma relating to corruption and irregularities with his tax affairs. Both the South African Revenue Service and the State Security Agency have issued statements, saying they intend to take legal action against Pauw and his publisher. The SACP's Alex Mashilo says the last time the state took this type of action it was during apartheid. “This will be remembered as the first case post-1994 where the state took action to ban a book. This will be a reversal of the rights we fought for, freedom of expression and our freedom to expose acts of corruption.” Meanwhile, Pauw is standing by his work. He says his information is credible and he hasn't broken any laws.    Cease Desist by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd
