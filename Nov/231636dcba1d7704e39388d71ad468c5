                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says there’s nothing new or untoward about the pay-out given to acting group CEO Nomsa Philiso. The City Press reported at the weekend that Philiso received a bonus of almost R900,000. However, the public broadcaster has denied this, saying that the pay-out was commission from when she worked as commercial enterprises head, which deals with sales and advertising. Philiso was appointed acting CEO in July after James Aguma was suspended. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says that she has received commission like any other employee in her department. “They get commission for delivering on targets set.” He says the amount is large because it accumulated over time. “Maybe you are supposed to get a R100 this year, then they’ll say we’ll give you R30 and you bank R70.” Kganyago says it’s important to understand that the commission has not been paid to Philiso in her capacity as acting CEO.  He went on to say it was acquired in the 2014/15 financial year and paid out in 2015/2016. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
