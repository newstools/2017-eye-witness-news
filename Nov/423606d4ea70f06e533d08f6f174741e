                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department says it’s in the process of moving a Lenasia pupil who was stabbed by a classmate to a different school. It’s understood the boy was stabbed in the neck by another pupil while walking out of the school grounds last week. It’s believed the 16-year-old accidentally bumped into his attacker who then retaliated. The department’s Steve Mabona says alternative plans for the teenager’s exams have been made. “We’re assisting the parents to facilitate a transfer to a new school because of fears for the child’s safety.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
