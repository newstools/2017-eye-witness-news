The province is the biggest in terms of the party’s membership. KZN is one of the provinces that ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said were lagging behind with holding branch general meetings and nominating leaders. The provincial party’s spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli says that while they admit that not all of their branches have sat for BGM’s, there has been progress.  "Those that have not taken place, it would be very few branches that have attempted it once, twice or a third time and could not succeed." But what happens to the branches that failed to meet the deadline? "If there is no further extension, it measn that they will not be attending the conference." Mantashe has told Eyewitness News that he will give an update on Tuesday on the state of the nomination process and the way forward for branches that missed the deadline.
