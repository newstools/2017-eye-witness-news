                                         JOHANNESBURG - The constitutional organisation, Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac), says money being used by intelligence agencies in the country needs to be properly accounted for. Investigative journalist Jacques Pauw has questioned how the State Security Agency (SSA) has been spending its multi-million rand budget and whether South Africans are getting any value from it. Pauw’s new book The President’s Keepers contains allegations against President Jacob Zuma relating to corruption and irregularities in his tax affairs. WATCH: Jacques Pauw joins Eusebius Mckaiser in the studio.  Speaking to Eusebius Mckaiser on Talk Radio 702 and CapeTalk earlier on Tuesday, Pauw said there’s complete secrecy about how the SSA spends its money. “We’re not allowed to know what State Security Agency spends on projects or their budget… you and I are not allowed to know how many people work there.” Casac's Lawson Naidoo says this is a major problem. “In respect of the allegations that have now been outlined in Pauw’s book; the very heart of the criminal justice system, those institutions that should be holding people accountable are the very organisations that have been captured.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
