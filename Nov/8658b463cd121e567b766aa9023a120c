                                         CAPE TOWN – Members of Parliament probing allegations of state capture have called for a thorough investigation into claims that State Security Minister Bongani Bongo tried to bribe the evidence leader in their inquiry. News reports over the weekend revealed that Bongo allegedly offered advocate Ntuthuzelo Vanara a “blank cheque” to resign from the inquiry. Vanara detailed the events in a signed affidavit which has now been sent to Parliament's ethics committee to investigate. On Tuesday, parliamentarians involved in the Eskom inquiry shared their views on the matter. African National Congress MP Mondli Gungubele says: “We support thorough investigations in the matter and a timeous finding so that we can be able to deal with the outcome.” Democratic Alliance MP Natasha Mazzone says the ethics committee's probe should be expedited. “Chair, I would encourage you as chairperson of this committee to write a letter to the Speaker on behalf of this committee, asking that this investigation take top priority.” However, Economic Freedom Fighters MP Floyd Shivambu suggested the Public Protector should also be investigating Bongo's conduct. “If a member of the executive violates the executive ethics code, the Public Protector is the one who should investigate such a violation.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
