                                         JOHANNESBURG - Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba on Friday revised the number of deaths from the Life Esidimeni tragedy from 141 to 143. He is testifying again at the arbitration hearings in Parktown.  Makgoba says that a total 1,711 patients were moved from Life Esidimeni facilities in Gauteng to ill-equipped NGOs.  Retired deputy Chief Justice Dikgana Moseneke has confirmed with Professor Makgoba exactly where the Life Esidimeni tragedy death toll stands. Makgoba explained that 1,711 patients were moved from Life Esidimeni at the beginning of the project in October 2015.  At least 270 of those patients were returned to their families. From October 2016 to February 2017, Makgoba found that 118 patients died but some were still with unlicensed NGOs.  During the process of moving patients back to high-quality healthcare facilities between February and May 2017, more patients died, leaving the number at 139.  However, four more patients died in September during the time that they were being monitored by doctors. WATCH: Esidimeni: Health Ombudsman set for second appearance  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
