                                         JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members have arrived outside the Israeli Embassy in Pretoria, picketing in solidarity with the Palestinians. Today marks 100 years since the Balfour Declaration, which opened the way for the creation of Israel. The party says it was that declaration that sowed the seeds of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which continues to tear apart the Middle East today. One marcher says they want the embassy to be closed down. “We call on all Muslims not to become cowards. When they arrive in this country, they must close shops in solidarity with the people of Palestine, the struggle of Palestine is our struggle. We are not liberated until the people of Palestine are liberated.” EFF leader Julius Malema has called on government to close down the Israel embassy in the country, saying the country can't be friends with people who don't respect democracy. Malema was addressing supporters outside the Israeli Embassy in Pretoria. “Our march is not against the Jews, our march is against the apartheid Israel and so we must not leave here thinking the Jews are our enemies.” EFF members marched to the embassy in solidarity with the Palestinians. Malema says this march is not against the Jews.
