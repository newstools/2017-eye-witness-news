                                         JOHANNESBURG - The ANC is expected to hold its special NEC meeting this weekend to discuss the nomination process for leadership positions and issues related to its upcoming elective conference. Some of the party's branches are currently holding branch general council meetings and have until next Wednesday to send their nominations. The ANC says it decided to convene this special NEC meeting to discuss secretary general Gwede Mantashe’s organisational report which must be finalised before the party’s conference. As the party draws closer to the conference next month, it’s been forced to deal with countless court cases by its own members, allegations of fake membership and disputes around the legitimacy of branch general meetings that are currently underway nominating leaders. NEC members sympathetic to President Jacob Zuma told Eyewitness News they will push for deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to be disciplined for announcing his slate last week.
