                                         JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng Premier David Makhura says while former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu has seemingly gone AWOL, he would like to encourage her and all those involved in the Life Esidimeni tragedy to answer to the bereaved families. He says that the provincial government is committed to the arbitration process and helping the grieving families of the 141 victims. Makhura says that the families must get the answers they deserve. “The families want to know the truth and they want to know what happened. My advice, everyone involved has got something to say or they have questions to answer.” The premier is due to testify at the hearings. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
