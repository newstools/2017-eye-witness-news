                                         IRENE - ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says the party is not worried about certain court cases. The Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Northern Cape and the Free State are litigating the outcomes of their respective provincial elective conferences- with factions arguing over alleged irregulars. The party has convened a special NEC meeting in Irene to finalise its organisational report among other issues. Mantashe is adamant that the court proceedings don't worry the ANC and believes the December conference will go on as planned. “We are working to hold the party’s conference from the 16th to the 20th. There’s nothing that says it won’t take place.” When asked about the state of readiness at branch level for the conference, he said the ANC has put teams in place to deal with appeals from branch general meetings. He says those processes should be completed by the end of the week. “We are planning a national conference and it will be a success.” (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
