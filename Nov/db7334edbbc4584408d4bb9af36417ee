The Backstreet Boys star has released a statement vehemently denying an accusation made by Melissa Schuman that he forced her into having sex with him. LONDON - Nick Carter has issued a statement in response to allegations made by Melissa Schuman that he forced her to have sex at his home back in 2002. Schuman, now 33, wrote a blog post in which she alleged the Backstreet Boys star performed oral sex on her without her consent and then made her perform a reciprocal act on him. Following that, Schuman - who was a virgin at the time - then claimed that Carter took her to his bedroom and had sex with her without her consent, with her repeatedly telling the pop star that she was saving herself for marriage. She claims the assault took place back in 2002 after he invited her to his Santa Monica home for a “casual hangout”. Schuman admits that she willingly shared a kiss with Carter after a “few shots” but did not want things to go any further. Carter, 37, has now addressed her allegation for the first time and in a statement issued to PEOPLE has said that anything that happened between them which was sexual was consensual. He said: “I am shocked and saddened by Ms Schuman’s accusations. Schuman never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that, anything we did was not consensual. We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Schuman both personally and professionally. “This is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later. It is contrary to my nature and everything I hold dear to intentionally cause someone discomfort or harm.” Following the alleged incident, Schuman went on to sign with Carter’s manager Kenneth Crear and she recorded several songs as a showcase for a major label, including a duet with Carter. However, she was never signed and “quickly lost interest in pursuing a career as a recording artist”.
