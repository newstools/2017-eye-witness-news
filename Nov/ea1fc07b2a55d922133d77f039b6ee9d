                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa  says the parliamentary inquiry into Eskom shows just how bad things were at the state-owned power utility and that it can’t get any worse. Ramaphosa told journalists in Parliament earlier that lawmakers are uncovering “a network of patronage and graft” at Eskom. Whistle-blowers, former senior executives, ex-board members and Minister Lynne Brown have all testified in the inquiry into allegations of state capture involving the influential Gupta brothers and their close business associates. The ANC appears divided on how to deal with state capture. This came to the fore when several MPs publicly attacked Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu over the scheduling of a debate on the issue in the National Assembly this week. Ramaphosa is firm on his position. “Obviously the ANC itself has to handle the differences between its ranks. These are matters the ANC must debate and must come to terms with." He says the MPs should have raised their concerns within the party. It has not been an easy ride for lawmakers and officials probing widespread corruption at Eskom.  Evidence leader Ntuthuzelo Vanara claims that State Security Minister Bongani Bongo offered him a “blank cheque” to resign.  There’ve also been behind-the-scenes attempts to intimidate some parliamentarians. Ramaphosa says these threats are out of order. He believes that state capture has contributed to the country’s economic woes.  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
