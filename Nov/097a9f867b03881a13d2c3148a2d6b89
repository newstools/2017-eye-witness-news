                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says that it has found more leaks in the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital and says they are likely to worsen if they are not attended to. Gauteng Shadow MEC for Health Jack Bloom visited the hospital last week for a walkabout. It is understood that the leaks were found in the lecture room on the 6th floor. Five people were injured when the roof at the hospital collapsed in March this year. Bloom says that the structure's integrity is still questionable. "There are ceiling leaks all over this hospital and it could get very serious. Fortunatley there was nobody in this particular area when the water came down. They removed sensitive equipment but I think the warning signs are there. I'm worried about the structural integrity of this hospital and they haven't been able to fix the leak problem."
