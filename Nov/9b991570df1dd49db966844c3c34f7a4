Metrorail has labelled that route as its most dangerous line in the Western Cape.  “We have thanked him for his courage and the bravery demonstrated when they do these patrols on a daily basis. This is the type of characteristic that comprises many of our Prasa officials, particularly security, and we must commend them.” It is also the line with the highest number of commuters.
