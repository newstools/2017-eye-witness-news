                                         JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has called on energy regulator Nersa to reject Eskom’s request for a 19.9% tariff increase. The union says Eskom  is misusing its power over South Africans grossly. Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi says the power utility is poorly led, with its senior management team drowning in serious corruption allegations. “More than half the population, that’s at least 30 million people, are living in abject poverty. Then Eskom comes to Nersa and makes a request for an almost 20% increase?”
