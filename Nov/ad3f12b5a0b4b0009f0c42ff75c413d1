                                         CAPE TOWN - Does the thought of not having coffee or chats around the water-cooler at work make you go cold? This could become a reality as the World Wildlife Fund for Nature appeals to corporates to slash water use next week for one day. WaterShedWednesday is a simulation of how it will feel if "day zero" arrives in the Western Cape. WWF spokesperson Claudia Schachtschneider explains, “What kind of water-saving initiatives one can do in the business and office while there’s still a choice of saving water. Also, to bring the message home that there are 87 litres of water meant to be used per person per day.”  On their website, WWF says they want to create much-needed awareness that people should take their water-saving habits with them everywhere - be it at home, work or play. For its #WatershedWednesday WWF South Africa is asking staff to bring their own (maximum 2 litres) water supply to work. Last week, Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille demonstrated exactly what would happen when Cape Town runs out of the municipal water. De Lille on Thursday announced “day zero” has been pushed back from March to May due to water savings and new water sources. The province’s average dam level is at just over 36%.
