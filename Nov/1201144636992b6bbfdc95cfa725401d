The outspoken rap star - who was once allied to Jay-Z's Tidal service - has submitted a trademark application for a similar enterprise, which is to be known as Yeezy Sound. LONDON - Kanye West  is reportedly trying to set up his own music streaming service. The outspoken rap star - who was once allied to Jay-Z's Tidal service - has submitted a trademark application for a similar enterprise, which is to be known as Yeezy Sound. According to the application, the trademark is for the purposes of "streaming of music, audio, images, video and other multimedia content over the internet". At the moment, though, it remains unclear whether Kanye intends to use the platform for his own content, or whether - like Jay - he will collaborate with a number of other artists, DailyMail.com reports. West, 40, and Jay-Z fell out with each other in 2016, with the rapper even criticising his former mentor during one of his on-stage performances. West - who previously claimed he was owed a $3.5 million in unpaid advances and bonuses by Tidal - said: "Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I've been sitting here to give ya'll the truth! "Jay Z, call me , bro! You still ain't calling me. Jay-Z, call me ... Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send them at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man!" The award-winning rapper also cancelled the remaining dates of his Saint Pablo tour in 2016 due to stress and exhaustion. But an insider recently said that Kanye - who is married to reality TV star Kim Kardashian West - is now the "best he's ever been". The source shared: "There haven't been any manic outbursts. You're going to see a calm Kanye who is taking it day by day. "Living with a mental illness is something that he will always have to be aware of, and spend time working on, but he's doing it. And he and Kim are stronger than ever."
