                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department  is urging parents to take precautions to prioritise their children’s safety amid a possible taxi strike in Tshwane on Tuesday.  A meeting is underway between the national taxi alliances on whether to go ahead with the strike. MEC Panyaza Lesufi says this strike is planned at a critical time when many pupils are writing their year-end exams.  He says a strike strategy programme has been sent to principals throughout the province.  “Which simply means that learners that arrive late are not penalised, and those that arrive during exams are allowed to sit but also those that miss exams that necessary arrangements be made for them to write those particular examinations.”
