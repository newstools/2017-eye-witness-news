                                         JOHANNESBURG - The post-mortem of one of the Esidimeni patients has been read out at the arbitration hearings, revealing that balls of brown paper and plastic were found in her digestive system and that she bled to a point of asphyxiation. Deborah Phehla was moved from a Life Esidimeni facility in Randfontein to the Takalani Home in Soweto. She is one of 141 mentally ill patients who died after the Gauteng Health Department moved them to ill-equipped NGOs. Zimbi Phehla says her daughter was diagnosed as mentally retarded when she was just four years old. Deborah died at Takalani Home, just three days after being moved there. Her mother says when she asked to see exactly where her daughter died, she was taken to a small room isolated from all the wards. She says she believes her daughter was forgotten about in that room and ate brown paper and plastic from old files stored there because she was starved. “To me, it seems they locked her up, forgot that there was a human being living in that shack and she ate those files and plastic because she was starving. I’m sure when they served other patients, they forgot about her.” The hearings continue on Thursday.
