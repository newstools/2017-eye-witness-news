                                         CAPE TOWN - A proposed notice of no confidence in Mayor Patricia de Lille will not be tabled next week. The Office of the Speaker Dirk Smit says the notice doesn’t comply with the city’s rules, including Rule 18.1.1 of the City’s Rules of Order.  The City's Dirk Smit said: “Every notice of motion shall be in writing in the form of a draft proposal and shall be submitted to the Speaker and such notice shall be signed by the member submitting it and by the member seconding it.” The letter received from the African National Congress Chief Whip contains only the signature of another ANC councillor Petronella Heynes and is signed on the behalf of the Chief Whip.
