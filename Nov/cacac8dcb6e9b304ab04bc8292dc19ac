                                         JOHANNESBURG - Thulani Serero’s Bafana Bafana future looks over after he denied a national call-up ahead of the World Cup Qualifier against Senegal on Friday. Serero snubbed a national call-up, citing that he will not honour the call-up if he is not guaranteed being in the starting line-up. Bafana coach Stuart Baxter says that Serero failed to inform him about his decision not to join the national camp on Tuesday. “Thulani failed to inform me about his decision. If he doesn’t want to honour a national team call-up, then he should put it in writing, so that it isn’t a case of he said, she said,” says Baxter.  The coach also suggested that the player’s national future doesn’t look bright. “I don’t think anyone is impressed with a player that thinks that if they won’t be selected, they shouldn’t honour a call-up. You can guess what implications that decision will have on his future.” Meanwhile, the progress of injury-plagued players Itumeleng Khune, Thulani Hlatshwayo, and Siphiwe Tshabalala continues to be monitored but Baxter is hopeful of their involvement in Friday night’s game. Khune is set to see another specialist to access the facial injury he sustained during the 1-0 TKO victory against Chippa United on Sunday. Baxter also says Khune has requested that a face mask is readied for the game. “Khune has asked us to get a mask ready for him, which means he is hopeful. But that could also be enthusiasm and ambition, but the final decision will be taken by the medical staff.”
