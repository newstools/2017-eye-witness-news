                                         JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has likened the Zanu-PF to President Jacob Zuma's African National Congress (ANC). Maimane is one of the speakers at The Daily Maverick’s The Gathering event at the Sandton Convention Centre on Thursday. He says the ANC is dead. Maimane says the outcome of the ruling party's elective conference in December doesn't matter because he believes one corrupt leader will merely be exchanged for another. “Come 2019, we must create an opportunity upon which we can rescue our country and steer our nation into a different direction. The change we seek will not be a change that will come from within the ANC.” Expected to speak later at the event is United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa, Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema and former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. #NandosDMGathering Maimane says he hopes the recent events in Zimbabwe help South Africa reflect on its own challenges.
