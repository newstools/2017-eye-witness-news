                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) and South African Communist Party (SACP) will for the first time go head-to-head in an election. Following a resolution to contest future elections independently , the SACP will on Wednesday go up against its alliance partner and other parties during by-elections in the Metsimaholo Municipality in the Free State. The SACP, Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and ANC make up the tripartite alliance, which agreed to work together as a “revolutionary alliance”. Last week, ANC leaders tried to convince their long-time ally not to go against the party and contest these elections. ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte explains: “We’ve had discussions with the communist party and we said fine, there’s nothing we can do about that now. We will all go and canvass votes.” The SACP has also indicated it will not go into coalition with the ANC, considering rather to be in partnership with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The SACP and the ANC have campaigned hard on the ground separately, with many asking if this the beginning of the end of the alliance? (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
