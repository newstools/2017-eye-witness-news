                                         CAPE TOWN - There's been another multi-million rand abalone bust in the Cape. Five people are expected to appear in court this week.  They were arrested at a house in Mfuleni with more than R3 million worth of perlemoen in their possession. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana says authorities acted on a tip-off. “Upon their arrival at the address, Pelican Walk, they found abalone with the estimated street value of R3.5 million, including equipment seized during this arrest.”  This brings to three the number of abalone hauls made in the province in the space of a week.
