                                         JOHANNESBURG - With just under 50 days to go before the African National Congress (ANC)’s elective conference, the party’s national executive committee (NEC) has called a special meeting to discuss certain issues, including the nomination of leaders currently underway. The party’s branches are currently holding branch general councils and have until 15 November to send their nominations for leadership positions. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe recently told Eyewitness News he was concerned about the Gauteng ANC giving guidelines to its branches on how to make nominations. This was after the provincial party sent a letter to its branches listing several names, with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa at the top as a preferred option for the position of president. ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said: “There are a number of issues, now, including the nomination process.” While many branches have already completed their nominations-there are disputes before Mantashe’s office with some ANC members complaining about the process followed to make the nominations and others claiming they were excluded.
