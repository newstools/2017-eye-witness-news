                                         CAPE TOWN - The amount of profit raked in by the company contracted to pay social grants, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), has been called into question. An independent audit commissioned by the Black Sash  and the Centre for Applied Legal Studies  has found that the company’s pre-tax profits may have been understated by as much as R614 million. But parent company Net1  says the assessment is all wrong and is calling for the report’s withdrawal. The Alternative Information and Development Centre was asked to conduct the review based on financial statements submitted to the Constitutional Court  in May. It says not enough information has been provided to the court to come to a definite conclusion about how much profit Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) has made from the contract to distribute grants. But it says the figures do not match those contained in the report of parent company, Net1. The centre says it’s also unclear whether any of Net1’s subsidiaries may have benefitted. But Net1 says the contract period on which the calculations was based has been overstated. It adds that subsidiaries identified in the centre’s report as potentially having benefited, have all been dormant since 2012 and were not involved in the Social Security Agency of South Africa (Sassa) contract. Net1 says any profits accrued by its other subsidiaries are publicly available, but that they do not have access to nor use Sassa data.
