                                         CAPE TOWN - Mothers of premature babies will now be able to get breastmilk to their hospitalised new-borns, thanks to a new project. The Health Department initiative called “Mom’s Milk on the Move” has been launched on Thursday ahead of World Prematurity Day on Friday. The project involves the transportation of a mother’s milk via scooter from their homes to the hospital. Soraya George lived in Mitchells Plain when she gave birth and was unable to visit the hospital every day to breastfeed her baby, who was incubated for several weeks. She says her older son had to use public transport three times a week to deliver expressed breastmilk to nurses at Groote Schuur hospital. George says this soon became costly. “He would deliver the milk on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. They kept the milk in a fridge.” She says her premature daughter, born at seven months, weighing 900 grams, survived on love and breast milk. That baby is now 18 years old and on Thursday attended the launch of the "Mom's Milk on the Move" project with her mother. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
