                                         CAPE TOWN - Two men have died and one left critically injured following a shooting at a Fruit & Veg shop in Strand. It’s still unclear what led to the shooting that occurred earlier on Wednesday afternoon at the business on Strand’s Main Road. Police are investigating a case of double murder and attempted murder. No arrests have been made. ER24’s Russell Meiring says when paramedics arrived at the scene, three men with gunshot wounds were found at the back of the building. “One man had already succumbed to his injuries. Nothing more could’ve been done for him and he was later declared dead at the scene. Two were found in a critical condition. “Paramedics immediately treated the patients and provided them with Advanced Life Support intervention.  Unfortunately, after some time one of the men succumbed to his injuries. Once treated, a third man was transported to a nearby hospital.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
