                                         JOHANNESBURG - A heated debate continued at the Daily Mavericks The Gathering at the Sandton Convention Centre. Owner of ANN7 and The New Age Mzwanele Manyi  says South Africa has not dealt with the real issue of white monopoly capital and the lack of economic transformation. Manyi was met with mixed reaction from audience members. There was a tense debate between Manyi, Iraj Abedian and author of The Presidents Keepers Jacques Pauw. Manyi claims that 80% of the black population remains poor and unemployed. “A lot of black miners have actually ended up signing their concessions because they were not able to get into the ring line because it is monopolised by white monopoly capital.” Abedian argued that he doesn’t like any racial monopoly capital. “What has happened at Eskom, Eskom has been hollowed out and sent to Dubai and Hong Kong under the guise of fighting white monopoly capital. We must get serious.” WATCH: The final session of The Gathering
