                                         CAPE TOWN - Activist group Social Justice Coalition (SJC) says that local government has been slow to address the urgent sanitation needs of people living in informal settlements. Sunday was World Toilet Day, a day earmarked by the United Nations to place increased focus on the need for proper sanitation to prevent the spread of disease. The City of Cape Town says that over the past several years, 55,000 toilets have been installed in poor communities.The city's Xanthea Limberg, however, admits that more needs to be done. “We call on our residents to assist us by looking after the infrastructure we provide. Together we can make progress possible.”  The SJC's Axolile Notywala says the plight of residents in these areas are dire and isn't being addressed effectively. “Using a toilet in an informal settlement is one of the most dangerous things you can do. Their rights to safety and being dignified is not being recognised because they don’t have proper toilets to use.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
