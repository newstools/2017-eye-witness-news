The KwaZulu-Natal ANC's provincial executive committee is applying to appeal a ruling that nullifies the party's 2015 elective conference. PIETERMARITZBURG - The KwaZulu-Natal ANC's provincial executive committee is applying to appeal a ruling that nullifies the party's 2015 elective conference. In September, Judge Jerome Mnguni declared the 2015 provincial elective conference unlawful and void. A group of disgruntled pro-Cyril Ramaphosa ANC members known as "the rebels" took the KZN PEC to court, claiming that there were irregularities with the gathering. The KZN ANC maintains that the court judgment found no irregularities with how the conference was convened but made a ruling based on clause 17 of the partyâ€™s constitution which speaks about when such a gathering should take place.
