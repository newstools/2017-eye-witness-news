                                         CAPE TOWN - The Social Security Agency of South Africa (Sassa) and the South African Post Office (Sapo) have failed to break their stalemate over the payment of social grants. They are meeting in Parliament on Wednesday evening to discuss the way forward after four meetings over the last 30 hours have not yielded an agreeable outcome. Treasury Director General Dondo Mogajane who has been mediating the process has told the joint meeting of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and the portfolio committee on Social Development, that more political guidance is needed to break the impasse. Sassa and the Post Office were sent to the negotiating table on Tuesday to thrash out their issues. The Post Office demanded reasons why it is being disqualified from three of four aspects of the contract. Despite letters exchanging hands, Mogajane says an agreement could not be reached. “In terms of where we are in trying to resolve this, the two parties have not found each other in terms of agreeing that Sapo should pay in the grants administration.” He says it’s worrying that the technical teams of Sassa and the Post Office have never met. And has suggested that the inter-ministerial committee provide political direction to decide on the way forward.
