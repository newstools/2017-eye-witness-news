                                         CAPE TOWN - DA leaders have not been able to shed much light on the status of an investigation into a public spat between Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille and her Mayco member JP Smith. It’s been exactly a month since a special sub-committee of the DA’s Federal Executive started its investigation. This comes after party leader Mmusi Maimane met with Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and Mayco member JP Smith over their public feud. The DA says the sub-committee is still conducting interviews with caucus members as part of the probe, but no details of the process have been given. Political analyst Erwin Schwella says in the past the DA succeeded in conducting probes quite quicker than this. “If you recall the Dianne Kohler Barnard episode and a couple of the others they’ve always been somewhat quicker.” Schwella says it might be taking longer because of the seriousness of the issue. “Look at what happened at the DA provincial leadership election ... it came out very close and shows that there is a strong resistance building up to the current leadership style and processes.” De Lille and Smith were placed on special leave from party activities last month as the investigation got underway.
