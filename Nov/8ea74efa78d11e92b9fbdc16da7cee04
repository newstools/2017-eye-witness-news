                                         JOHANNESBURG - A metro police officer is recovering in hospital after he was attacked by a group of churchgoers.  It’s understood that officers towed an illegally parked car belonging to a member of the church in Hillbrow when one of the officers was disarmed, assaulted and left unconscious.  The Johannesburg Metro Police Department says that the officer fired four warning shots to stop the congregants from attacking him but the crowd continued to attack them.  Spokesperson Wayne Mienaar says: “The Joburg Safety Department strongly condemns the attack on a JMPD officer in Hillbrow where a car belonging to a member of the church was hooked up for parking illegally.  “The officer was knocked unconscious despite shooting into the air to prevent the attack.” One of the congregants was arrested for the illegal possession of an officer's service pistol. Meanwhile, church leader Derek Sibisi has defended the actions of the church members. He says there is a parking issue in the area and that members are tired of being harassed by the JMPD.  The councillor and MMC for Public Safety in the City of Johannesburg, Michael Sun, adds: “The officer is still being treated in hospital. I must commend the officer he held his composure and followed protocol.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
