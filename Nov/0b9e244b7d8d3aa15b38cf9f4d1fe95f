                                         JOHANNESBURG - The City of Cape Town is looking to implement a technology system which records gunshots being fired in more crime hotspots. The ShotSpotter system has already been phased in in gang-infested Hanover Park. The program places law enforcement agencies in close proximity to where these firearms are being discharged, which increases the potential of arrests and illegal weapon confiscations. The city's metro police chief Wayne le Roux says they're awaiting additional funding in the coming financial year to continue to roll out this technology. “There are certain areas that have been identified and at this stage. This is in line with smarter and innovative policing in order to reduce crime in particular areas.” WATCH: gun violence in gangland: See how tech is fighting gun crime
