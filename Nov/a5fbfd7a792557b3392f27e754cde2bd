                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Cyril Ramaphosa says that the government should establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for those who have looted state coffers and want to come forward and confess. Addressing an SACP Red October rally in Mpumalanga on Saturday, Ramaphosa says that all those who have stolen from the public must pay back the money. He says the commission will give the corrupt officials an opportunity to tell the truth and name those who are implicated in state capture corruption. Ramaphosa says the money should be paid back to effectively address the economic burden of the past and those who donâ€™t come forward must be brought to book. He says the ANC must make sure that the faith people have invested in the party is restored. "We must rebuild our economy. Our econmy is in dire straights right now and one of the reasons why our economy is i dire straights, it is because our public enterprises, in a number of cases, have not been working as well as they should have."
