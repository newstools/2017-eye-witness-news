The SIU will probe allegations of unlawful or improper conduct relating to the registration and licensing of motor vehicles along with irregularities with driversâ€™ licences. The unit will focus on the registration of motor vehicle ownership, issuing of driving licenses and roadworthy certificates. The proclamation signed by the president also authorises an investigation into allegations of data on the electronic national traffic information system being manipulated. The conversion of foreign driving licenses and military driving licenses to civilian driving licenses will also be under the spotlight. Provincial Departments of Transport, local authorities and entities that perform functions of the department, as permitted by the law, will also be scrutinised. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
