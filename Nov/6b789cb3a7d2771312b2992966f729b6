                                         JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says that the Chamber of Mines has until Wednesday to accept its wage demands. NUM says that its members are prepared to go on strike if it continues to negotiate in bad faith. The union says that coal workers do not intend on accepting a three-year wage deal.  Instead they want a once-off payment for this year and an 8% wage increase for next year. NUM spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu says: “We will only sign a  three year agreement if the Chamber of Mines accepts to remain in the centralised bargaining forum. If the chamber does not come to the party, we can even go on strike.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
