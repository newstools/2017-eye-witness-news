                                         JOHANNESBURG - Trade union Solidarity  says it will approach Lonmin by Wednesday to communicate its members' grievances around the treatment of skilled employees and what it says is the preferential treatment of members of the Association of Mineworkers and the Construction Union (Amcu) by the company. The union says there is a high possibility that its members will go on strike next month, bringing production at Lonmin mines to a standstill. Platinum producer Lonmin is faced with the possibility of a strike as early as next month, but its spokesperson Wendy Tlou says she is not aware of trade union solidarity’s intent to go on strike. “I certainly have not been told by our Human Capital Department that there have been any issues in terms of their perceived treatment. It’s a union that represents a very small minority of our workers.” But the union’s general secretary Gideon du Plessis says Lonmin should be aware of this development because the mandating process and the petition against chief executive Ben Magara was conducted transparently at mine level. “We will then communicate with the company on Wednesday, declare an official dispute. But their management is aware.” Solidarity says at the core of their dispute is the right of association enshrined in the Constitution and so they feel justified in their actions.
