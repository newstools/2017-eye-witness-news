                                         JOHANNESBURG - Mining union Amcu says it expects Implats to reconsider job cuts as its revenue and production have increased. The mine this week recorded a 9.6% increase in production. Last month, Implats announced 2,500 jobs may be at risk at its Rustenburg operatio n after the mine failed to return to profitability for a fourth-year successive row. Amcu's Jeff Mphahlele says that Implats' improved revenue and production should be good news for workers. “We are hopeful for the original figure that was communicated.” He says that the mine has already started communicating this. However, Implats' Johan Theron says that an increase in production may not necessarily translate to less jobs being lost. “There has certainly been an improvement in the efficiencies of the different mining times. That bodes well in terms of the discussions of jobs, but it’s too early to comment.” While the mining industry has shed close to 70,000 jobs since 2012, with Sibanye-Stillwater recently retrenching over 2000 workers, Implats says that it is exploring all options to prevent job cuts.
