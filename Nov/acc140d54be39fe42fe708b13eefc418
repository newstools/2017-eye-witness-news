                                         CAPE TOWN - A man has been sentenced to life behind bars for raping a 16-year-old girl. The sentence was handed down in the Willowvale Regional Court on Friday. The rape occurred in January last year. The police's Jackson Manatha says Xolisa Nanstula chased three girls who were on their way home from a traditional ceremony in the Busila village in the Eastern Cape. Two of the teenagers managed to escape. The 33-year-old perpetrator, however, caught one teenager and stabbed her before sexually assaulting her in a field. The young woman survived and was hospitalised for serious injuries. Her attacker was arrested soon after. Local police officials say theyâ€™re pleased with the life sentence that has been imposed on the convicted rapist.
