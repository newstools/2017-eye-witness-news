                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Blitzboks are out to defend their Dubai and World Sevens Series titles when the brand new Series kicks off in Dubai on Friday morning.  The South African Sevens team won five of the eight finals they competed in, including the Dubai tournament, last season. Captain Philip Snyman’s men will face Uganda, Kenya and Canada in a favourable pool stage in Dubai.  Snyman says his side needs to hit the ground running in Dubai.  “We’ve had a good preseason and we’ve assembled a strong squad here in Dubai, so It’s important to do well in our first game against Uganda and hopefully set a good tone for the rest of the tournament.”  Snyman also says that the Sevens side has created good depth in recent times. “It’s fantastic that we have 15 to 20 guys that can step up into the squad at any time. We have the Academy squad also playing here in Dubai and that creates great competition within the set-up”  The Blitzboks take on Uganda at 08h52 on Friday.
