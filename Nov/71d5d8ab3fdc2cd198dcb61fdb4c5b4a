                                         CAPE TOWN - The State in former Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Mananaâ€™ s assault case has called for a sentence that will send a strong message to women abusers. Manana has pleaded guilty to beating three women  at a Johannesburg restaurant in August. Arguments in mitigation of sentence have wrapped up in the Randburg Magistrates Court. The State has told the court a fine would be slap on the wrist and Manana should be given a strong sentence. It says should Manana be handed correctional supervision, it should come with strict conditions that he does not touch alcohol. The former Deputy Higher Education Minister has admitted that alcohol may have played a role in the way he reacted when he assaulted the women. The defence says Manana is willing to compensate the victims and pay a fine of no more than R100,000. The sentence will be handed down on Monday.
