Emergency services say upon arrival on the scene on Friday night, the deceased was found under the crumbled wall. She didn't respond to the medical treatment and was declared dead on the scene. The other four were transported to the hospital in serious conditions for further medical care. Ekurhuleni emergency service’s William Ntladi says the police are investigating the incident. “The actual cause of this incident is unknown at this stage; however, on-scene information suggests there were strong winds blowing and the wall lost its integrity. It collapsed and subsequently people were injured.”
