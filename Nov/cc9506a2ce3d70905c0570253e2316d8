                                         JOHANNESBURG - Lawyer Norman Arendse has strongly denied allegations made by former ANC MP Jennifer Ferguson that he was fishing for information to discredit her.  Last month, Ferguson posted a Facebook blog post in which she alleged that Danny Jordaan raped her in a Port Elizabeth hotel more than 20 years ago. Jordaan, who has kept his silence for more than two weeks, is expected to release a statement on Wednesday. Ferguson claims that Jordaan's former lawyer contacted the father of her child, asking him for any information to be used as part of a smear campaign against her. Arendse says he is not Jordaan's lawyer and was not trying to get information to discredit Ferguson. LISTEN: Lawyer responds to Jennifer Ferguson's claims
