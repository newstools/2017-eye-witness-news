                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliamentarians have urged two groups of sugarcane growers to find a solution to a feud that's got lawmakers worried about the pace of transformation in the sector. The trouble started when the South African Farmers Development Association (Safda), representing black farmers, complained it was not getting recognition from established players in the industry. The association's gripe is with the South African Cane Growers' Association, which is part of the overarching Sugar Association. Safda claims the lack of recognition is hampering its participation in the sugar industry. Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry met with various players in the sugar industry last week. Lawmakers were told of the department's attempt to resolve the dispute. Committee chairperson Joanmariae Fubbs has urged government to be firm with the industry going forward. She's suggested that the department audit the cane growers' membership and leadership structures to determine the extent of representation by black farmers.
