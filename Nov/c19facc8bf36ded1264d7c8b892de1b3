                                         CAPE TOWN - The Congress of the People (Cope) has asked National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to allow a debate of national importance on the allegations contained in Jacques Pauw’s book, The President’s Keepers. Party president Mosioua Lekota says that the extent of wrongdoing detailed in the book at institutions like Sars, the police service and the State Security Agency, among others, is so great as to implicate those involved in treason. Lekota says that he wrote to Mbete last Monday asking for the debate to be scheduled as a matter of urgency. In a statement on Monday, he says he’s concerned that Mbete has yet to respond to his request. Lekota says that South Africans need to know how Parliament intends to deal with the allegations in Pauw’s book. The official opposition is on Tuesday laying a complaint with Cape Town police against State Security Agency Director-General Arthur Fraser and members of his family in terms of the prevention and combating of corrupt activities act. Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says Pauw’s book details an agent network that Fraser set up and that an internal probe found evidence of nepotism, corruption and the mismanagement of funds amounting to tens of millions of rands.
