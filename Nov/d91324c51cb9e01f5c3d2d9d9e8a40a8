                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has kicked off a debate on the “scourge of state capture” after an attempt by some African National Congress (ANC) MPs to stop it from going ahead this evening. The official opposition had called for Tuesday’s debate in the wake of leaked emails revealing the influence of the Gupta family on state-owned companies. The controversial Gupta brothers are accused of influence-peddling to score lucrative state contracts. Although some ANC MPs appealed to the presiding officer to prevent the debate from going ahead, House chairperson Thoko Didiza ruled against them. “From the Speaker and the National Programming Committee, there was nothing that was seen as untoward by having this debate.” DA MP John Steenhuisen was first up. “If ever there was a reason for this House to be having this debate today, it was confirmed in glorious technicolour on Monday evening. Watching the clip from the Gupta TV of a gang of six ANC MPs defending state capture, tearing viciously into their own chief whip as well as their colleagues on the Public Enterprises committee and threatening to disrupt this debate as we’ve seen them start off today.” WATCH: National Assembly debates State Capture
