Members of the #UniteBehind movement were demanding President Zuma be arrested and charged. Eight members of the organisation lay on the floor of the offices and refused to budge. Bruce Baigrie, one of the organisers, says it’s time for the NPA to take action against President Zuma. “Police have warned the activists they will arrest people and a warrant was issued. The eight activists insisted they will not move.” Police were called to intervene. @UniteBehind enough is enough @ShaunAbrahamNPA #ArrestZuma or #ArrestUs #occupationNPA pic.twitter.com/eNVbayWa2r  @UniteBehind NOW occupy NPA offices #ArrestZuma or #ArrestUs. pic.twitter.com/ikjxjITunG  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
