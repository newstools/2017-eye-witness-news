While the Western Cape is experiencing its worst drought in a century, other parts of the country are also experiencing water shortages. CAPE TOWN - It will rain… eventually. But the million-dollar question is when? University of Cape Town (UCT)’s Future Water Research Institute says the back of the drought will get broken at some stage, but it’s difficult to predict exactly when. While the Western Cape is experiencing its worst drought in a century, other parts of the country are also experiencing water shortages. UCT’s Dr Kevin Winter says it’s tricky territory attempting to predict which weather pattern may bring much-needed rain to the Cape. “It’s very unlikely that El Nino, from our experiences so far, brings rainfall down to the Cape. It will affect more of the interior and further north of the Cape. But I don’t think we have any experience in the past to be able to suggest that El Nino is going to be able to affect our frontal system.” Winter adds there’s no previous model to go on to predict how and when the drought will get broken. “Whether it’s with spring cloud or moisture from the north, we haven’t seen that before.” At the same time, Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane has threatened to turn off the taps as some municipalities around the country have not paid their water bills. More than R10 billion is reportedly outstanding. LISTEN: Mokonyane appeals to defaulting municipalities to pay up  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
