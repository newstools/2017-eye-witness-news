                                         CAPE TOWN - Futuristic police cars may soon be able to identify suspects. That’s according to a Houston-based tech company, Coban Technologies, which sells cameras to police. The firm announced this week a new dashcam has been designed to use artificial intelligence to identify everything - from people and vehicles to guns. Coban’s technology is designed to work with up to six cameras, so police departments could choose to turn their vehicles into 360-degree cameras, making it easier to identify faces.  The tool also allows for immediate, automated analysis of videos.
