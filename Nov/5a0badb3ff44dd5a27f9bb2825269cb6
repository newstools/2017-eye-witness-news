                                         PRETORIA - Higher Education Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize says while her department welcomes the release of the fees report, officials still need to scrutinise it to reach a suitable final solution. She says government must have the space to weigh up all aspects of the proposals made in the report, including knock-on effects. Mkhize briefed the media at the Universities South Africa offices in Pretoria on Tuesday. Mkhize says policy decisions of university fees should contain sustainable solutions that will last. Mkhize says there needs to be informed discussion. “However, it’s very important that all of us, the public, students and institutions we should fully understand that the report does not pronounce on anything.” The minister has appealed to students and others to ensure a peaceful end to the academic year.
