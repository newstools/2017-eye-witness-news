                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Chamber of Mines has opposed Eskom’s application to raise tariffs by 19.9%, saying it will affect the country’s economic growth. The chamber presented its response to the utility’s application for a tariff increase at the hearing by the National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa). Its warned that hiking tariffs will lead to higher electricity prices, lower growth and less electricity consumption. In October, the South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) said it was concerned by the recent electricity tariff hike request by Eskom. The union said the requested hike would not be affordable to ordinary citizens, particularly given the country’s high levels of unemployment and poverty. It added that the increase will further result in consequential increases in food and transport.
