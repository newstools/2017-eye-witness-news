The court heard on Monday how the president’s settlement offer was comparable to asking the former NPA head what his price was. PRETORIA - The High Court has referred to former prosecutions boss Mxolisi Nxasana as being party to a bribe, by accepting a R17 million settlement offer from President Jacob Zuma. This was heard in Pretoria on Tuesday morning, where Corruption Watch and Freedom Under Law are challenging the advocate’s 2015 golden handshake. The court heard on Monday how the president’s settlement offer was comparable to asking Nxasana what his price was. Advocate Jeff Budlender has asked the court to declare the deal between President Zuma and Nxasana unlawful and set it aside. He says the default position would be for Nxasana to be reinstated because he is entitled to the position from which he was unlawfully removed. It was here where Judge Willem van der Linde questioned Nxasana’s suitability to be the National Director of Public Prosecutions, saying the facts reveal that he was on the one end of a bribe. He questioned whether its desirable to have a prosecutor who is willing to take a bribe lead the National Prosecuting Authority.
