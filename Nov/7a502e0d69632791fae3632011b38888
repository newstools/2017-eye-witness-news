                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma will be delivering his annual address to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) this afternoon.  He is expected to provide an update on the progress made in the past year in improving South Africans’ quality of life especially the poor. Zuma will be making this address against the backdrop of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba painting a dire state of the economy in his medium-term budget statement last month. Zuma will be speaking to representatives from the provinces under the theme ‘Deepening unity in action for inclusive growth and Africa’s renewal - Reclaiming the legacy of OR Tambo’. Zuma’s speech will be debated by members afterwards. Last week, the president faced some tough questions in the National Assembly during the last question and answer session for the year, including whether he received illegal payments from a businessman after becoming president. He’s also under increasing pressure from Parliament’s Higher Education committee and the public, to release the Fees Commission report into the feasibility of providing free tertiary education.
