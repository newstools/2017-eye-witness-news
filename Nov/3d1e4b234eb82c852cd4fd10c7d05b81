                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts consultative conference has heard that President Jacob Zuma has made the country vulnerable.  The conference has received messages of support from civil society, despite the ANC distancing itself from the event.  Last year, former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor  claimed that she was offered the job of Public Enterprises Minister by the Gupta family at their home while Zuma was in another room. During an address on Friday, chairperson of the Nelson Mandela Foundation Professor Njabulo Ndebele reminded the audience of that moment.  “At that precise moment he left his country completely vulnerable and exposed. Its citizens were left scrounging around with an increasing sense of powerlessness.” Several of the party's NEC members are in attendance, including former president Thabo Mbeki. ANC stalwart Wally Serote says there is a valid reason why they decided to hold this conference.  He says that by the end of this conference, there should be a clear answer to one burning question. “How has it happened that the ANC has not been able to save the honour of the people of this country?” Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and former Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom are also in attendance.
