                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng government has appointed a team of experts to strengthen the provincial health management and systems. The team which consists of officials with requisite skills and experience will start their duties on Friday. Premier David Makhura, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa have been briefing the media on the recovery plan for the Gauteng Health Department. Makhura says a high caliber intervention team will turn the public healthcare system around in Gauteng and improve its performance. “There’s a very drastic deterioration from last year of the Department of Health. Some of the things we come across have to do with HR infrastructure issues, we’re also carrying out forensic investigations because we want to be certain that part of this deterioration is not a result of corruption.” Minister Motsoaledi says the team will also receive support from the national Health Department. “The problems in the department are not only financial but also managerial.”
