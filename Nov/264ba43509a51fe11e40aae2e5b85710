                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former ANC MP Makhosi Khoza says her work now involves uniting local community leaders to bring about political change. Khoza visited Zamdela in Sasolburg on Sunday.  She says that she's doing work at a municipal level to find out the needs of people and deal with uprooting corruption.  LISTEN: Makhosi Khoza: ANC no longer cares about the people  Khoza says that the only reason she left the ANC after being a member for 35 years  is because of the corruption which has eroded the party. “It has become inherently corrupt. I am here to declare corruption as the number one enemy of the people.” Khoza says she's not sure about working towards the title of president, but says she's working on uniting community organisations. “They come with a formidable force where we’ll have representatives directly from these formations. When they go to Parliament, they’ll have a mandate directly from their communities.”  She says that her role is to bridge the gap between political parties and the needs of communities.
