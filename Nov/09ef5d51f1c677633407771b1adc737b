                                         JOHANNESBURG - As the African National Congress (ANC) prepares to hold its elective conference next month, there have been questions about whether the party will face another split, and what could happen to the ANC-led tripartite alliance. With Less than 20 days to go, Eyewitness News looks at the possibilities of a win for either of the two front runners, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa. From the start, Cyril Ramaphosa has campaigned on a unity ticket, promising that his presidency will avoid a repeat of the split in the ANC post Polokwane in 2007.  But would Ramaphosa’s victory unite the organisation and the already strained ANC-led alliance?  Political analyst Mcebisi Ndletyana: “If a Cyril faction wins, then you stand a far better chance of limiting the damage that the ANC is likely to suffer.”  Fellow analyst Ralph Mathekga explains what he believes might happen within the alliance.  “I think that it’s going to become clear as to what’s tenable for the SACP and Cosatu within the alliance and what it is that they could achieve.” The SACP and Cosatu believe only one thing can save the alliance and that’s a Ramaphosa victory come December.
