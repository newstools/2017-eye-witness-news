                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has condemned what he calls the racialisation of farm murders. Mbalula also says the belief that there is a political agenda to murder white farmers is in bad taste. Mbalula says he has spoken to many people on farms - who have told him they are not safe. He says there are plans to empower community policing forums to improve policing on farms. “We’re dealing with farmers in terms of their concerns, we’re engaging with them together with the SAPS. We’re very clear on the question of murders.” He has been meeting with MEC’s and private security agencies at the SAPS academy to map out a way forward to combat such crimes. Plans include effective and visible policing during the festive season. WATCH: Protesters gather at Voortrekker Monument for #BlackMonday
