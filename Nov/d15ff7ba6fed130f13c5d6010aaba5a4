                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says that it is concerned by reports suggesting that the disciplinary hearing of its suspended executive Matshela Koko has collapsed and that the entire process was a farce with a predetermined outcome.  Koko was suspended for failing to declare a conflict of interest when he awarded a multi-million-rand contract to a company linked to his step-daughter. There's been several delays to the proceedings due to the unavailability of a chairperson for the hearing.  The power utility's interim board chair Zethembe Khoza says that Kokoâ€™s hearing is being conducted in a fair, professional and transparent manner.  Spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe: "The people who are heading up this inquiry are lawyers in their own right and are independent of Eskom. So any suggestion that these people have taken some sort of conclusion in this matter is giving a wrong impression that they are siding with Eskom." The hearing is expected to resume on Thursday.
