                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has confirmed that a task team of NEC members has been put together to deal with the appeal of last month’s Eastern Cape elective conference, which turned violent. At least seven delegates were injured when violence erupted during the conference which was dubbed "the festival of chairs". Mantashe has clarified that the outcome of the conference has not been nullified and therefore the provincial party’s new leadership is still in charge. He says the appeals panel, which is composed of four NEC members and three other technical people, will report back to the NEC. “We put a panel to listen, interrogate and ask questions into witnesses, that’s what we’re expecting. And on the basis of the evidence before that panel, that panel will make recommendations, then a decision will be taken.”
