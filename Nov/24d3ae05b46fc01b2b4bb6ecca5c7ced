Dr Barney Selebano played a key role in the movement of psychiatric patients from life Esidimeni to ill-equipped NGOs. JOHANNESBURG - As the Esidimeni arbitration hearings resume on Thursday morning, families who lost loved ones will have to wait until Monday to find out whether the suspended Gauteng Health Head of Department will testify at the proceedings. Dr Barney Selebano played a key role in the movement of psychiatric patients from life Esidimeni to ill-equipped NGOs. One hundred and forty-three of these patients died. Selebano is fighting a subpoena which compels him to testify at the hearings. He appeared in court on Wednesday where judgement was reserved. Dressed in a black suit and white shirt, Dr Selebano sat in the public gallery as he listened to argument between his lawyers and the State. Selebano’s representative, Craig Watt-Pringle, asked Judge Daniel Berger to declare that the proceedings led by retired deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke are not an arbitration because there is no dispute as the State has already conceded responsibility for the patients’ deaths. State lawyer William Mokhari however says Selebano’s application has no legal ground and should be dismissed because the law has no clear format on how an arbitration should be conducted. Judge Berger then said he would make his decision on Monday, exempting Selebano from having to appear before Moseneke next Monday, which is the date stated on his subpoena. If Berger rules against Selebano, he will be forced to testify at the arbitration hearings next Tuesday.
