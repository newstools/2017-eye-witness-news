                                         CAPE TOWN - With all fires on Table Mountain having been extinguished, crews have begun vacating the area. Earlier this week, a fire on the north side of Table Mountain damaged some property on the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) grounds. Philip Prins, South African National Parks’ fire manager, says they will remain at camp until Monday. “Everything has been very quiet since Saturday… we’ve not had flare-ups. Most of the teams have been sent home and the rest will be patrolling the area to ensure that everything is safe.” Meanwhile, in Nyanga, two people suffered from smoke inhalation after their structure caught alight. The fire was extinguished, and no serious injuries were reported.  WATCH: Cape ablaze: 2 fires ravage WC simultaneously
