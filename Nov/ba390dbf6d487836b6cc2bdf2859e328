                                         JOHANNESBURG - It’s unclear whether President Robert Mugabe will attend the swearing-in ceremony of the man who deposed him as Zimbabwe’s ruler. WATCH: Mnangagwa: I pledge myself to be your servant  The Herald is on Friday morning reporting that Emmerson Mnangagwa assured Mugabe and his family maximum security in Zimbabwe when the two men spoke for the first time since Mnangagwa returned home. Both men have reportedly agreed that the 93-year-old needs rest after the hectic events of the past two weeks and that he may not attend today’s event. Mugabe was expected to inspect the guard of honour as the mark of his departure after 37 years in power before Mnangagwa was presented as the new head of state. Zimbabweans have already started arriving at the national stadium for the inauguration. Meanwhile, the Southern African Development Community says it’s committed to working closely with Mnangagwa.
