The deadline has been extended several times to allow those branches to be in good standing The ANC insists its reached the necessary threshold to continue with the elective conference next month. But it says it wants to do everything possible to ensure as many branches are as possible take part in the gathering. Spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says: “Our objective and desire has always been we want 100% of the ANC branches and to attend the conference even though it’s way above the 70% which is a threshold.” The party says the delays in wrapping up the nomination process, won’t affect the work of the electoral commission-which was meant to be sifting through the nominations by now. It’s also confident that the extension won’t affect the dates for the conference. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
