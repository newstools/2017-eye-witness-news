                                         JOHANNESBURG - While the new Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa says the country’s economy will be based on agriculture, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says he should not regress on land ownership. Mnangagwa was sworn-in as president of Zimbabwe on Friday following a military takeover which led to Robert Mugabe's resignation after 37-years in power. The EFF says Mnangagwa and his ruling Zanu-PF must not give the land back to white people and that the indigenous Zimbabweans should continue to own the land. It says Zimbabwe should produce its own food and feed its own from land owned by Africans. EFF's Floyd Shivambu said: “That is the struggle we’re waging here in South Africa to reclaim the land, so we would not want regress in terms of the land. He must stabilize Zimbabwe, its economy and regain the currency but he must never sellout on the land.” Shivambu says Mugabe’s best policy under his rule was to take the land back to the black Zimbabweans. “One of the most progressive things to happen in Zimbabwe was to take the land from the colonial settlers and we believe president Mnangagwa must never take the land to the settlers because it does not belong to them.” WATCH: Crowds cheer as new president of Zimbabwe is sworn in
