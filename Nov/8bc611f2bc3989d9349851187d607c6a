                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former President Thabo Mbeki has expressed disappointment at the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) for failing to support a consultative conference organized by its own stalwarts. Mbeki delivered a message of support to the final day of the conference on Sunday in Braamfontein. "As all of us know, the veterans and MK council had prefered that this national consultative conference be organised jointly with the national executive committee of the ANC but I think it is clear that the NEC did not want this to happen." Former President Kgalema Motlanthe is also attending the gathering. Last week, the ANC distanced itself from the gathering, saying that ANC leaders who attend it, do so in their individual capacity.
