                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Police Ombudsman is investigating whether a decline in the appointment of police reservists is affecting the South African Police Service's service delivery in the province. This follows a request by standing committee on community safety chairperson Mireille Wenger. Wenger asked the Ombudsman to look into the decline in the number of active reservists in the Western Cape. A moratorium which was placed on the recruitment of reservists lifted in 2015 could be one of the main reasons behind the 84% decline in reservists numbers since 2008. But Wenger says only one reservist has been re-recruited in the Western Cape over the past three years. “This is cause for concern because police reservists play a critical role in assisting the police and their role cannot be underestimated. We have chronic police under-resourcing which does have a negative impact on crime and a negative impact on safety in our communities.”
