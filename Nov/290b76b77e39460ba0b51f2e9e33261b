Zuma was addressing ANC supporters in Kagiso on the West Rand on Sunday afternoon.

He says he is happy that he will step down as ANC president in December to give others a chance.  He says stepping down as ANC president will also give him a chance to respond to those who talk nonsense about him or the party. The president also criticised some ANC leaders who have delivered lectures on OR Tambo, saying many used their addresses to criticise the current leadership of the party.
