                                         CAPE TOWN - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has threatened to take the Political Party Funding Bill on judicial review if it is passed in its current form. The ad hoc committee tasked with reviewing party financing this week approved the draft legislation, which is expected to come before the house next year. Debating the committee’s report in the National Assembly on Thursday, most parties backed the bill, which will introduce new rules governing private donations and greater transparency. The EFF’s Thembinkosi Rawula says his party believes the bill will reproduce existing political power imbalances and is unconstitutional. “The EFF will take the whole bill on judicial review if it is passed in its current form.” Dr Corne Mulder of the Freedom Front Plus accused the EFF of grandstanding, saying parties had worked constructively over the past six months to draft the bill. “The house should be proud of this bill because it will protect democracy. It will bring transparency to our system and I think it is absolutely essential.” The Democratic Alliance (DA)'s Alf Lees says the bill doesn’t go far enough in preventing the use of state resources to influence elections and that it will hinder “honest parties” from raising campaign funds. The bill provides for the creation of a multi-party democracy fund that will receive donations from both individuals and companies and distribute them among parties represented in the national and provincial legislature.
