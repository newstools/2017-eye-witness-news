                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Emfuleni mayor accused of sexually assaulting and grooming a 14-year old girl is currently in a council meeting where he is allegedly tabling his intention to resign. Simon Mofokeng has been placed on special leave pending the investigations into his alleged conduct. Last week, the Democratic Alliance in Gauteng marched to his offices, calling for the African National Congress integrity committee to sack him. The DA’s Kingsol Chabalala says they hope his resignation will be accepted. “We’re saying it’s a victory in our fight against abuse of women and children, his resignation is a victory.”
