                                         CAPE TOWN - Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen has snubbed lawmakers for the second time in as many weeks. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has been pushing for several months for him to appear to clarify why his department used the services of a financial consultancy firm, Trillian Capital, which has been linked to allegations of state capture at other state entities. Van Rooyen has also been linked to the controversial Gupta family since his short stint as Finance Minister in December 2015. After cancelling his engagement with the portfolio committee last week, Van Rooyen on Wednesday sent an apology, saying there were important matters he had to brief Cabinet on. But the DA’s Kevin Mileham says this is unacceptable. “It’s time that the minister appears before this committee and there’s no more softball with him, it’s a requirement. I think he must stop ducking and diving.” Chairperson of the committee Richard Mdakane has previously tried to dismiss the need for Van Rooyen to appear, saying inquiries into state capture will get to the bottom of any of the claims. “But I can guarantee Honourable Mileham that the minister is more than willing to come and account.” Van Rooyen is next scheduled to appear before the committee in two weeks’ time to address the electricity crisis facing municipalities.
