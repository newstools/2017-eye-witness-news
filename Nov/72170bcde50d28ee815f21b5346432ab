                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has slammed those who are anti-nuclear, saying people who don’t support the project are backing the wrong force. The president addressed supporters in Kagiso on the West Rand on Sunday. The City Press newspaper reported on Sunday that while the nuclear energy deal was set to be finalised in February next year, it would now be completed in the next two weeks. President Zuma took a considerable amount of time speaking about the nuclear build programme. “I hear people talking even when they don’t know what they are talking about, saying we don’t want nuclear.” He has a message for those who are against the project. “In other words, in the balance of forces, you support the wrong force.” The president told the supporters that “we are in war,” adding that they must understand that South Africa is very important in the global context.  ‘STOP BLAMING ME FOR EVERYTHING’ Zuma also hit out at those who attribute every problem the country faces to him, saying that they don’t understand what he calls the balance of forces. The president made it clear from the beginning that he would not deliver a memorial lecture but talk about politics generally. Speaking in Zulu, he told his supporters that the country is famous for thinking that every problem is caused by him. “Even when someone has lost a shoelace, the problem is Zuma. When there’s a drought, they say it’s because of Zuma.” The president also told his supporters he can’t wait to step down as ANC president in December, saying that will give him the chance to respond to those who talk nonsense about him and the party.
