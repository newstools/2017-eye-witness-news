Police Minister Fikile Mbalula earlier this week promised the army will be deployed to crime-riddled areas in various provinces. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Health Department says it's looking forward to the deployment of the South African National Defence Force in some of the province's most dangerous areas. This comes after another attempted armed robbery of Metro EMS staff this time in Mfuleni. The paramedics were unharmed in the incident this week thanks to community members who came to the rescue. Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo says being escorted by soldiers will give emergency workers peace of mind when they are deployed to some of the Cape's most dangerous communities. At the same time, she calls on communities to come forward with information around ambulance attacks. “But again we appeal to the communities because they are the eyes, they are the ears, they can see what’s happening and they need to report because once we see lots of convictions, we’ll be able to know that some of perpetrators are behind bars.” Police Minister Fikile Mbalula earlier this week promised the army will be deployed to crime-riddled areas in various provinces, including Gauteng and the Western Cape before Christmas. Mbalula had previously requested that the army be rolled out to assist police with crime fighting. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
