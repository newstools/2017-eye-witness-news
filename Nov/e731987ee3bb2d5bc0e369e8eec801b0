                                         BATANGAFO - The United Nations Security Council  has unanimously approved a resolution increasing a peacekeeping force in Central African Republic (CAR). Meanwhile, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has jump-started its services there. Sporadic violence has flared up in recent months. Earlier this year, the medical charity had to suspend some of its operations in the most volatile regions the conflict-torn country. Jeff Brian De Souza says he’ll definitely renew his contract to continue working with MSF in CAR.  The 31-year-old mechanical engineer is quite popular with the children as he entertains, chases, teases and frightens them with ghost-like sounds. The aid worker left Montreal, Canada a month ago. “We’re trying to be there for them and play with the children when we can.” De Souza has been deployed to Batangafo to assist with logistics management. “I was fed up my regular 8 to 5 job in Canada and changed to this.” MSF staff treat between 40 to 50 children for various medical conditions at the local hospital on a daily basis.
