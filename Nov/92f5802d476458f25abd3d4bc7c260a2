The DA says it doesn’t understand why former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu has not yet paid back the money after leaving her portfolio for months. JOHANNESBURG- While former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu is yet to face her day in the Esidimeni arbitration hearing, the Democratic Alliance (DA) says she has not yet paid back some of the money spent on security upgrades at her Bedfordview private residence. It’s emerged Mahlangu exceeded the R200,000 security upgrades limit that was offered to the MECs between 2009 and 2014. Mahlangu was ordered to pay back over R52,000 by Premier David Makhura. The DA says it doesn’t understand why Mahlangu has not yet paid back the money after leaving her portfolio for months. Mahlangu stepped down in February in the wake of Esidimeni tragedy, which saw the death of 143 psychiatric patients. Meanwhile, on Friday, Mahlangu said she notes with concern that several media reports, which are regularly surfacing in the country about her, are false and without basis in fact. Mahlangu added that she has always maintained that she's willing to appear before the arbitration, saying that she has confidence in the process. Mahlangu was suspended from the institution’s Global Banking School in London this week. The University of Bedfordshire says it suspended Qedani Mahlangu because “the severity of the allegations against her in South Africa.” However, her lawyer Stanley Pincus says this is unfair and they will fight it. The DA says it will be monitoring the Gauteng government and Mahlangu to ensure that she pays back some of the money. DA shadow health MEC Jack Bloom said: “It’s quite a disgrace that she overspent on these security alterations to her private home and hopefully she’s made to pay the money as soon as possible.” LISTEN: Dates set for Mahlangu’s testimony at Esidimeni hearings
