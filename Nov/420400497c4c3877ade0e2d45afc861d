                                         JOHANNESBURG - Brian Molefe’s counsel has argued that the former Eskom boss did resign but on the basis of early retirement, which is invalid. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and trade union Solidarity are in court on Wednesday, arguing that Molefe should repay part of the R30 million that was already given to him under the guise of an early retirement. The DA and Solidarity have argued that Molefe resigned and therefore wasn’t entitled to R30 million payout for so-called “early retirement”. But Molefe’s lawyers say he stepped down to take early retirement. Molefe was appointed as a Member of Parliament for a brief period when he first left Eskom in December 2016. He was reappointed to the CEO position and when his controversial pension payout came to light he left the utility. Most recently he’s joined the army. Molefe’s counsel has argued that he cannot be blamed for misunderstanding what he was entitled to, in terms of early retirement. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
