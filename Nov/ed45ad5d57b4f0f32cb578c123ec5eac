                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma says that there is nothing factual about claims of corruption in Nkandla, saying that everything about the security updates at his home was just political. The president spoke to news channel ANN7 in an exclusive interview on Monday night. Last year, the Constitutional Court found that he acted in breach of his obligations in terms of Section 96 of the Constitution, when he failed to take any steps to stop the state-sponsored non-security related upgrades of his Nkandla home. He has since been ordered to pay back over R7 million for the upgrades. "If you remember when the story about Nkandla started... 'Zuma has chowed so many millions'. There were three investigations and they found nothing, absolutely nothing." He made indirect reference to the Constitutional Court judgement, which he says suggested he was being "funny to his oath". “The judgment comes and creates an impression that this Zuma has done so much. I’m just saying.” The president says there was a political reason behind the Public Protector’s report on Nkandla.
