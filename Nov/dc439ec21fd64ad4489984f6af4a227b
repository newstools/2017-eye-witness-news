                                         CAPE TOWN - The case against a City of Cape Town law enforcement officer arrested on charges of drug possession has been postponed to next week for bail information. Clinton Langeveldt made a brief appearance in the Bellville Magistrates Court on Thursday; he has been remanded in custody and is due back in the dock on Wednesday. He was arrested by the Hawks in Bellville South earlier this week and was found in possession of 41,000 mandrax tablets valued at nearly R2 million. Investigators apprehended him after receiving a tip-off. Mayco member responsible for Safety and Security JP Smith says he's shocked by this incident. He's confirmed pre-suspension procedures are being instituted. Smith says the officer was off-duty at the time of his arrest and also breached protocols as he was in possession of his official firearm.
