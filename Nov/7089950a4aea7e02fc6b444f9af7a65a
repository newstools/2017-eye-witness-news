                                         JOHANNESBURG - While a new book by investigative journalist Jacques Pauw has unearthed damning allegations against President Jacob Zuma, concerns have been raised about a PDF version being circulated on social media following reports the book might be withdrawn. On Saturday, the book The President's Keepers was widely shared on social media sites with many cautioning that downloading the book without paying is illegal and tantamount to stealing the hard work of the author. NB Publishers say they have received a cease and desist letter from the State Security Agency, demanding that they withdraw the book from all stores while Sars says it's seeking legal advice on what steps to take, including but not limited to criminal and civil investigations against Pauw. Huffington Post Editor-at-Large Ferial Haffajee says people should rather buy the book and support investigative journalism. “The President's Keepers is an absolutely wonderful and important book to help us understand what has happened to our country. I think it’s important that we go out and buy it or even download it from Kindle, the copies that are being circulated on PDF injure investigative journalism.” NB Publishers say their lawyers are now dealing with the matter and have no intention of withdrawing the book at this stage.
