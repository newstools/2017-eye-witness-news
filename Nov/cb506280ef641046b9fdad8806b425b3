                                         CAPE TOWN - Some online shopping service websites have crashed with many customers trying to cash in on Black Friday deals. Takealot, which is currently offline, took to Twitter to apologise to scores of users, who had experienced issues accessing and purchasing items from the website from the early hours of the morning. The https://t.co/FoxSAGgqv7 website and apps are temporarily down.We’re so sorry for disappointing any customers who are trying to shop this Black Friday, and we’ll be back up and running as soon as possible. pic.twitter.com/i5XS8YR6eo  CEO Kim Reid says they’ve experienced a service failure. “We’ve had a service failure with a critical piece of code which communicates with much of the site. It took us a little while to figure this out. Our priority right now is to get that up and running.” Black Friday is the day where people go all out for bargains and price cuts. Shoprite's Niel Shroeder says they’re prepared. “We know what to expect now and we have much more security and client control than someone doing it for the first time. People are patient and we hope everyone has a good day.” Follow the Black Friday developments via EWN’s live blog. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
