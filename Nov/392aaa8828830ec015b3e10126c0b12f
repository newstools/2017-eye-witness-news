CAPE TOWN - Metro Emergency Medical Services is investigating whether an ambulance robbery on the N2 is entirely to blame for an eight-year-old's death. The boy was being transported from a day hospital to the Red Cross Children's Hospital when the ambulance was ambushed near the Borcherd's Quarry offramp during the early hours of Wednesday morning. The child had sustained head injuries in a car crash in Delft and was declared brain dead in the ambulance. EMS’ Shaheem de Vries says the incident underlines a broader problem. “The scale and impact of the problem is massive emulation to the citizens of the city.” It’s believed stones had been placed on the road forcing the crew to pull over.
