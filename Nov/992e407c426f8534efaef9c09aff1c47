One-hundred-and-twenty-one delegates voted in favour of Ramaphosa. Delegates who are still gathered at the province’s special general council meeting in Cape Town voted in favour of Lindiwe Sisulu taking over as Ramaphosa’s deputy. Gwede Mantashe is the preferred candidate for the National Chairperson position. Senzo Mchunu has been endorsed as secretary general and Zingizwa Losi as his deputy. Paul Mashatile has been endorsed as treasurer general. Acting ANC Western Cape Chairperson Khaya Magaxa said: “The Western Cape will be supporting the name of comrade Cyril Ramaphosa as the president of the ANC, including even some of those few branches that have nominated otherwise.” Officials are still busy finalising the results.
