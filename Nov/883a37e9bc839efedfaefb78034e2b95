JOHANNESBURG - Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba has welcomed the dismissal of Makgabo Manamela’s appeal on his findings and recommendations into circumstances surrounding the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Over 140 mentally ill patients died after they were moved from Life Esidimeni Care Centre in 2016. Manamela had appealed to the independent ad hoc tribunal, headed by retired judge President of The Gauteng High Court Bernard Ngoepe, challenging the ombud’s findings. Makgoba says the dismissal would help bring truth to the matter. “I welcome the judgment and obviously it takes us a step further in this process of trying to unravel what happened at Life Esidimeni.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
