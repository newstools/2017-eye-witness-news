                                         JOHANNESBURG - Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says that big business in South Africa must avoid public confrontations with the government.  Mogoeng was speaking at the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Awards Dinner in Parktown on Tuesday night.  He said that the business sector is far too important to be caught up in spats with the government. “Stay away from an open confrontation with those in government. There’s a way you can deal with and deal with them properly behind closed doors - it’s likely to be more productive.” Last month, Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) said that it does not want to be affiliated with entities that are thought to be engaged in corruption. BLSA has suspended the membership of both Eskom and Transnet as a result of ongoing allegations of corruption against the state enterprises. Transnet has, however, accused the group of spreading misleading information, claiming it was not pushed but left BLSA in an effort to cut costs. But the business group’s CEO Bonang Mohale says they're sticking to their story, despite the parastatal’s claim. “Transnet and Eskom have been captured. Because of them being captured and allowing themselves to be controlled by the Gupta and the Zuma families, that why the BLSA is choosing not to associate with them.” Additional reporting by Shamiela Fisher.
