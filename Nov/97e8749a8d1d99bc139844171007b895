                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State says the absence of its provincial deputy chairperson Thabo Manyoni at the provincial general council should not be seen as a boycott. The provincial party started its council on Tuesday where Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma was nominated for ANC president. Some branches supporting deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa say that the gathering was marred by irregularities, claims the provincial party has denied.  Manyoni, who is seen as a strong supporter of Ramaphosa, raised suspicion when he failed to arrive at the gathering. Free State ANC spokesperson Thabo Mmeko says: “The deputy chair is not the only one. Not the entire PEC was there, including him. He has tendered an apology that he will not be able to attend the meeting. We can’t disclose why, it’s an ANC internal matter.”
