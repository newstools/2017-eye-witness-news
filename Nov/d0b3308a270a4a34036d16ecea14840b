                                         PRETORIA - The march against farm murders drew to a close as hundreds of people headed back from the Union Buildings after reading out a memorandum to President Jacob Zuma. The Saturday march follows a nationwide protest several weeks ago. Hundreds of people stood in the rain on the lawns of the Union Buildings in Pretoria as AfriForum’s Ernst Roets read out the memorandum to be handed over to the government. “We bring this new intention because we believe all other avenues to solve this problem have proved to be fruitless. We also wish to inform you with this memorandum that should the crisis at hand not be resolved, we would resort to an intensified an international campaign to raise awareness.” The memorandum was handed over to a representative from the Presidency after which the march made its way back to the Pretoria Art Museum. AfriForum has given President Zuma seven days to respond after which it will take further action.
