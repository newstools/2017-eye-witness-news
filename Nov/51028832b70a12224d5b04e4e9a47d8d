                                         CAPE TOWN - Authorities are once again calling on communities to come forward with information about an attack on an ambulance. There has been another attempted armed robbery of Metro Emergency Medical Service (EMS) staff, this time in Mfuleni. The paramedics were unharmed in the incident on Thursday. The Western Cape Health Department says that armed men attempted to hijack the ambulance at the Mfuleni Day Hospital. However, the attackers fled when community members came to the rescue. Police then escorted the ambulance out of the area. Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo says: “It’s still so sad to see these attacks. The attacks on ambulances happen mostly in areas where we’re needed most.” Last week, robbers ambushed an ambulance on the N2 near Borcherds Quarry, an act which may have led to the death of an eight-year-old car crash victim who was being transported at the time.
