                                         CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament has come under attack from the opposition over its response to serious allegations of state capture and the apparent role of Cabinet ministers in aiding the controversial Gupta brothers. The Guptas are accused of influence-peddling to score lucrative state contracts. During a fiery debate in the National Assembly on Tuesday night, the Democratic Alliance (DA) pointed out that most of the committees tasked with probing state capture are stuck in the starting blocks. DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says it has been several months since four portfolio committees were directed by House Chairperson Cedric Frolick to investigate state capture. To date, only the Public Enterprises portfolio committee has made progress. “And most importantly, why has the president not appeared before a single one of the committees in this House to account for a single one of the serious allegations?” ANC MP Mondli Gungubele jumped to his party’s defence, saying it’s not soft on corruption. “An enhanced oversight of Parliament has borne fruit and possibility which saved the state billions of rands. There has been a series of interventions, with ANC cadres participating with high morale rectitude and integrity.” But the ANC appears divided on how to deal with the issue. A handful of MPs broke ranks this week by accusing their Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu of siding with the DA. Mthembu hit back, saying that their claims were malicious and dangerous.
