                                         CAPE TOWN - Australia's multi-billion-dollar desalination plant in Perth cost its residents the equivalent of a cup of coffee per week. As western Australia experienced a serious drought, a desalination plant was commissioned and came online a decade ago. Back home, the City of Cape Town is hoping to pump an extra 300 million litres of desalinated water into the supply system. Plans are underway to build a dozen desalination plants, the majority of which will be temporary, with the first ones expected to come online in February. But there will be a price tag attached. Civil engineer Gary Crisp is an expat working in Perth and he’s aware of Cape Town’s persistent drought. There’s no doubt in his mind that city authorities have to be ahead of the climate change curve and build a permanent desalination plant. He believes a site near Koeberg's Power Station is a logical choice. Crisp has patted Capetonians on the back for the decrease in water consumption. Perth has less than half the number of residents compared to Cape Town, but uses 200 million litres more water per day.
