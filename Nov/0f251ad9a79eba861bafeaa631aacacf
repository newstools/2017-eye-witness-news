                                         CAPE TOWN - A dispute over whether municipalities should bear the responsibility of maintaining the country's electricity distribution network has been debated in Parliament. It's a battle that's raged between local councils and Eskom  for years now. Members of Parliament say the matter can't be resolved while cash-strapped municipalities are expected to pay millions in debt owing to the power utility. Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen was expected to lead the meeting; his absence has enraged MPs. An advisory panel is to be established to consider related legislation on who should bear responsibility for electricity distribution infrastructure. But parliamentarians say the issue is going around in circles and there appears to be no progress or suggestions on how to resolve it. Energy committee chairperson Fikile Majola said: “The more we delay, we’re not going to be able to resolve this problem and it’s going to be insurmountable.” MPs say it's time Eskom considers writing off the historical debt owed by municipalities because it's unlikely they will ever be able to pay the more than R10 billion they owe.
