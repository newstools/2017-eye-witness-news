                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State will on Tuesday hold a provincial general council (PGC) to nominate its preferred presidential candidate. The governing party is gearing up for its national congress next month where President Jacob Zuma’s successor will be elected. So far, only the Northern Cape and the Western Cape have held their provincial general  councils. While both provinces have nominated Cyril Ramaphosa, the Free State is expected to choose his rival Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. LISTEN: The Showdown: What does the future hold for ANC, SA if Dlamini Zuma wins?  During the PGC, the party’s electoral commission will open envelopes with nominations from branches and then the congress will consolidate them. It’s unclear why the provincial party chose to go against secretary-general Gwede Mantashe’s directive to hold the council together with its elective conference later this week. Mantashe said last week that holding the gatherings separately would be a waste of resources and energy. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
