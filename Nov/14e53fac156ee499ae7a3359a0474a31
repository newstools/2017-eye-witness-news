                                         JOHANNESBURG - A prominent rights lawyer is expected to announce his candidacy for president in next year's elections. Khaled Ali, who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2012, is expected to make the announcement at a media briefing on Monday in which he will also outline his policies. Itâ€™s being reported that Ali has been directly involved in month-long talks with leaders of secular parties on fielding a joint candidate. The move is unlikely to seriously challenge the incumbent general-turned-president, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi's campaign but will test his popularity at a time of deep economic hardships.
