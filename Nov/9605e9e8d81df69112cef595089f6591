                                         LONDON - England battled to a fifth successive win over Australia when they triumphed 30-6 at a sodden Twickenham on Saturday but they had the TMO official and three tries in the last eight minutes to thank for a flattering victory. In difficult conditions, it was mostly a game of attrition and tactical kicking but Australia will wonder quite how they were so effectively beaten on the scoreboard after dominating most of the second half and looking the more dangerous team. The TMO had disallowed a first-half Michael Hooper try for offside and allowed Elliot Dalyâ€™s key 54th-minute try to stand and open a 13-3 lead for England. He also ruled out what would have been a score-equalling try by Wallaby winger Marika Koroibete 10 minutes from time. England took full advantage of their let-off as Jonathan Joseph and Jonny May chased Danny Care kicks to score before Care finished things off to give England a record victory margin over the Wallabies.
