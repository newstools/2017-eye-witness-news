LOS ANGELES - Ryan Seacrest has denied the misconduct allegations made against him by a former stylist. The 42-year-old television presenter has disputed the "reckless allegations" made against him by a former wardrobe stylist who worked with Ryan when she was with E! News a decade or so ago. In a statement, he said: "Recently, someone that worked as a wardrobe stylist for me nearly a decade ago at E! News, came forward with a complaint suggesting I behaved inappropriately toward her. If I made her feel anything but respected, I am truly sorry. I dispute these reckless allegations and I plan to cooperate with any corporate inquiries that may result. "I treat all my colleagues with kindness, dignity, and understanding, as this is a principle that's core to who I am. Throughout my 25 years in the entertainment industry, the majority of my co-workers have been women, and I've endeavored to foster a positive work environment of mutual respect and courtesy, as that's how I believe it should be. I'm distraught that anyone or any situation would call that into question. I'm proud of my workplace reputation, and believe my track record will speak for itself. I'm an advocate for women. I will continue to support their voices." E! News have also confirmed they are investigating the allegations. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news of the alleged misconduct, which was said to have been reported around one week ago. Details of the alleged misconduct remain private at this time. It comes after a string of misconduct allegations were made against the likes of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, House of Cards actor Kevin Spacey, filmmaker Brett Ratner and Gossip Girl star Ed Westwick.
