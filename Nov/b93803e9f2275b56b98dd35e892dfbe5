                                         CAPE TOWN - The University of the Western Cape (UWC) says it hopes government gives it direction, following the release of the Fees Commission report. Several universities have told Eyewitness News they are still studying the more than 700-page report, which President Jacob Zuma released on Monday. Zuma will comment on the report once the ministers tasked with studying the document have concluded their work. Western Cape universities are not yet commenting on the Fees Commission report which has found free higher education for all is not feasible and recommends government-backed loans from commercial banks as a solution. The University of Cape Town’s Elijah Moholola said: “On face value, the executive is impressed with the thoroughness of the report. It appears that the matter was taken very seriously and the inputs from stakeholders have been included in the final report.” The Cape Peninsula University of Technology's Lauren Kansley said: “We’ll apply ourselves to its content in due course and this will ultimately allow us to implement the appropriate financial planning measures for the 2018 academic year.” UWC says its executive management awaits the Presidency’s announcement on the way forward and hopes to receive direction so that it can plan around the decision. Stellenbosch University has declined to comment for now. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
