                                         BENGALURU - Midfielder Jack Wilshere is fully deserving of a place in the England squad after his return to full fitness, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Wednesday ahead of his team’s Europa League clash against Red Star Belgrade at the Emirates Stadium. Wilshere, who broke his leg while on loan at Bournemouth last season, has been largely limited to cup appearances this season but has impressed with his creativity in Europe. The 25-year-old has not featured for his country since the last-16 defeat by Iceland in last year’s European Championships. However, Wenger believes a fully fit Wilshere will be an added asset in attack for England manager Gareth Southgate ahead of this month’s friendlies against Germany and Brazil. “A super-fit Jack, I don’t know how you can keep him out of the English squad,” Wenger told a news conference on Wednesday. “I think he is ready, personally. He was not three weeks ago, but he is ready now. In every single competition he is ready to play,” the Frenchman added. Arsenal, who are top of Group H with three wins from as many games, will rotate their squad for Thursday’s clash with Red Star with one eye on Sunday’s Premier League game against leaders Manchester City. “I have gone into a rotation policy and I want to stick with that as I am pleased with our performances in all competitions. We can qualify tomorrow and if we win we will qualify as top of the group and that is important. “Both of the teams do well, even in training when they play against each other it is very tight.” Red Star, who are third in the group behind BATE Borisov, were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal last month.
