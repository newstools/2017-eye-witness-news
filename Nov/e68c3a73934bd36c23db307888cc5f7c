The Florida Christian School website has a list of items available for purchase. These include winter wear, red school logo T-shirts and ballistic panels. George Gulla, the dean of students and head of school security at Florida Christian School, told CNN the bulletproof panels would add "another level of protection" to students of the pre-K through grade 12 school "in the event of an active shooter." The school has never had a shooting incident.
