                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament has decided not to institute removal proceedings against Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. This after a complaint from the Democratic Alliance (DA) that she’s not fit to hold office following her handling of the Absa/Bankorp matter. But Parliament’s Justice Committee submitted a report to the National Assembly saying she’s apologised for making a mistake, and there’s no basis to act against her. The DA says Mkhwebane is not impartial enough to hold the office of Public Protector, she’s overreached her powers by ordering the mandate of the Reserve Bank be changed, dictating to Parliament to amend legislation and consulting with the president and the State Security Agency on remedial action. The Economic Freedom Fighters’ Thembinkosi Rawula agrees. “By refusing to have the conduct of Ms Mkhwebane investigated, the ANC in Parliament has shown once more that they do not care about morality.” The African Christian Democratic Party and Inkatha Freedom Party also supported an inquiry into Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office, but the report recommending that no action be taken was agreed to by the House majority.
