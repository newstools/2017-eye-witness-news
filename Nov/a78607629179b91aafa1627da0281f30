                                         CAPE TOWN - There’s been no request for asylum in South Africa for former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. That’s the official word from International Relations Deputy Minister Luwellyn Landers who is briefing Parliament’s portfolio committee on government's position on the recent developments in Zimbabwe. Parliamentarians have praised Zimbabwe for the way it’s handled the political crisis without violence or bloodletting. But they disagree on whether or not former President Mugabe should be offered asylum in South Africa. African National Congress (ANC) Members of Parliament (MPs) says South Africa should not meddle in Zimbabwe and the country should be allowed the space to resolve its own issues. MP Bheki Radebe has applauded Zimbabwe’s military for guaranteeing the safety of Mugabe. “The role of former President Mugabe will always be appreciated, in particular by the South Africans.” But the Democratic Alliance's (DA) Stevens Mokgalapa says that the SADC has failed Zimbabwe repeatedly. “The other question is where was South Africa in terms of our failed quiet diplomacy.” While the DA says it doesn’t want government to offer Mugabe asylum in South Africa, the ANC says it’s a matter for Home Affairs to deal with.
