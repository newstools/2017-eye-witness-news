                                         CAPE TOWN - Political parties will next week have to make proposals on how much of their private funding they are prepared to disclose. A Parliamentary ad hoc committee will also be holding another round of public hearings to discuss the issue. In written submissions to the committee, some organisations have expressed the view that political parties should not accept money from foreign donors. The ad hoc committee has less than a month to wrap up deliberations on political party funding before it has to report back to the National Assembly. A key debate is how money from state coffers should be split. Parties appear to agree that the current ratio of 90:10 which benefits the three major parties, is unfair. The African National Congress' Donald Gumede said: “We need to move but when we move, we have got to look at equitability and proportionality.” The Economic Freedom Fighters' Leigh-Ann Mathys said: “Parties can't grow because of a lack of resources.” The committee says it will take its lead on these matters from the public input it will receive next week.
