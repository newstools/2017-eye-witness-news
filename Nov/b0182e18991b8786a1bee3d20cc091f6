CAPE TOWN - Police have arrested four suspects wanted for rapes in Crossroads, Cossovo and Nyanga over the past few days. The arrests come days before the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign. The campaign runs from 25 November to 10 December. Two suspects have been arrested for allegedly raping a woman in Nyanga over the weekend. Officers are tracing a third accomplice. A man was also arrested for allegedly raping his girlfriend after leaving a shebeen in Cossovo in Samora Machel. In a third incident earlier this week, a man was charged with the rape of a three-year-old girl in Crossroads. Parliament's Police Portfolio Committee has this week proposed eight measures to strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to combat gender violence. Among them are calls for additional resources to the police's family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit and the ongoing training of officers.
