                                         CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Mervyn Dirks has been reported to the National Assembly Speaker after allegedly trying to assault female ANC MP and making threatening gestures. Dirks denied the allegations when he was confronted by House chairperson Cedric Frolick. Frolick later ordered Dirks to leave the chamber after opposition MPs complained that he was showing them the middle finger. Dirks denied doing so, but while protesting his innocence made the same gesture. Democratic Alliance chief whip John Steenhuisen spoke out first, saying Dirks should be told to leave. “House chairperson just before the House adjourned, honourable Dirks was seen – and I saw with my own eyes – visibly attempting to strike one of the female members sitting next to him.” ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu intervened: “Threats and gestures of assault have been made against members at the back there, we’ve therefore asked those members to put in writing all those allegations so we can indeed formally put them before the Speaker.” So did Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula: “It is 16 days of activism we cannot have a man who is going to threaten women in this Chamber – let alone strangle.” Dirks denied the charges. Later, Frolick ordered him to leave after he showed the middle finger at opposition MPs, something he also denied doing.
