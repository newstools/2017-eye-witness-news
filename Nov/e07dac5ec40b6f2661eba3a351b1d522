                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress  in Johannesburg says it will on Friday morning open corruption charges against former Democratic Alliance MMC for Economic Development, Sharon Peetz, at the Jeppe Police Station. Peetz is accused of faking a proof of payment to a travel agency for a family member to accompany her on an official trip to Spain. The party says it condemns the alleged misconduct and criminality, particularly when it's at the expense of the people of Johannesburg. Chief Whip Solly Mogase said: “We need to recoup that money, but charges have to happen because DA claims to be these holy people that are fighting corruption. And as I’ve said, through my investigation I’ve seen that they’ve taken no action.”
