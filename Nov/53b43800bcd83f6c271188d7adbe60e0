                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe's state broadcaster ZBC has reportedly been put on stand-by for an expected address by the military. Monday afternoon's statement is due to be delivered a day after President Robert Mugabe failed to announce his resignation to an expectant nation. Earlier, a prayer session was held in Harare. Protest Pastor Evan Mawarire spoke to the crowd, saying: “[We want] A Zimbabwe without oppression, evil, corruption and a dictator.” Zanu-PF has drawn up its draft impeachment motion ahead of Monday afternoon's discussion on removing the 93-year-old leader after he missed the noon deadline to step down. The ruling party removed Mugabe as its president and first secretary on Sunday, capping a dramatic week after the military seized power last week, saying it wanted to remove "criminal elements" around the president.
