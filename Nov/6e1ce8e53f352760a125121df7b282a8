                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) intends writing to the chairperson of Parliament’s communications committee, asking for a probe into former Communications Minister Faith Muthambi’s alleged role in a deal between news channel ANN7 and MultiChoice. The latest intallment of the Gupta-leaks has revealed how a questionable payment of R25 million was paid to the Gupta-linked channel. It’s also claimed that a 2015 document shows that MultiChoice more than tripled its annual payment to ANN7 to  R141 million after Muthambi pushed through legislation that benefitted MultiChoice.  But the pay TV provider insists there was nothing sinister about the deal. Now, the DA has given MultiChoice 48 hours to publicly release the full details of the contract it entered with ANN7 and all the records prior to the contract negotiations. Spokesperson Phumzile van Damme says: “In August this year, the Deputy Speaker of Parliament requested that the communications committee begin an investigation or an inquiry into state capture, particularly relating to allegations around Faith Muthambi. We believe that inquiry is now long overdue.”
