                                         JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says its members will only accept a three-year wage agreement if the Chamber of Mines remains in the centralised bargaining forum.  The union says if the Chamber of Mines complies with this condition, it expects a 9% salary hike for workers in the final year of the deal. The NUM has announced its members will go on strike over wages in the coal sector on 19 November. NUM spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu said: “We don’t hope. We’re going to strike on Sunday. The NUM is still demanding R1,100 once-off for this year and 8% for next year.” A protracted strike in the coal sector could affect South Africa's power supply as about 85% of electricity is generated from the fossil fuel.
