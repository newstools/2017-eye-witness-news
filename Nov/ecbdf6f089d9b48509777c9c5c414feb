                                         PRETORIA - Corruption Watch and Freedom Under Law (FUL) will on Monday launch an application to set aside the R17 million golden handshake given to former prosecutions boss Mxolisi Nxasana.  The organisations are challenging President Jacob Zuma and the Justice Minister Michael Masutha’s decision to remove Nxasana in 2015 through a settlement agreement.  Corruption Watch and the FUL argue that Nxasana never asked to vacate his office as required in the National Prosecuting Authority Act.  It’s on these grounds that they want Zuma and Masutha’s decision to remove him be reviewed and set aside.  The parties argue that since the day Nxasana took office, there was a campaign by senior members of the NPA to undermine his authority.  The application is also being opposed by prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams, who argues that his predecessor was not coerced into entering a settlement agreement and that he voluntarily resigned.
