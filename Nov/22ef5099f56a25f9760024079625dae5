                                         JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the police missed an opportunity to test their rubber bullets on white skins when a group from a farming community dressed in black and gathered across the country to spread awareness about farm killings. Malema addressed supporters outside the Israeli embassy earlier on Thursday. The EFF leader says had it been black protesters on Monday police would have reacted violently. “It was an opportunity for them to test the skin of white people with rubber bullets… they missed an opportunity. So, we’re saying to them they know we’re watching them, even their loud mouth minister, who did not instruct them to shoot at these racists.“ The South African Zionist Federation has reacted to the EFF’s picket at the Israeli embassy, calling it absurd. It’s also warned that by attempting to destroy the relationship with Israel, South Africa and its people stand to lose the most.
