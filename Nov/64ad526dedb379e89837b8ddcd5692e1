                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it will oppose the lifting of legal head Suzanne Daniels' suspension at the CCMA, saying that the misconduct charges she faces has nothing to do with her exposing executives accused of irregularities. Eyewitness News can reveal that the power utility issued Daniels with two completely different charge sheets last month to motivate her suspension.  Daniels' internal report handed to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown explains Eskom’s relationship with Gupta-linked Trillian and consultancy firm McKinsey and implicates several executives, including suspended Matshela Koko and Anoj Singh. Daniels faces several misconduct charges in relation to the utility’s contract with McKinsey and Trillian as well as a report she compiled explaining these agreements. The damning internal report exposes several executives and shows how Eskom ignored legal advice more than once about entering into an agreement with the consultancy firms. But in the charge sheet, Eskom says that Daniels failed to give the implicated individuals an opportunity to explain the allegations contained in this report that is based on several external investigations. It also says Daniels failed to declare any irregularity with its contract with McKinsey even though her report clearly outlines this. Daniels is going to the CCMA on Tuesday to fight her suspension.
