                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabweâ€™s former finance minister Tendai Biti has spelled out the challenges that the country has to overcome in the coming months following Robert Mugabe's removal from power. Biti was speaking at the Daily Maverick's The Gathering, which is underway at the Sandton Convention Centre. In his opening remarks, Biti said that Zimbabwe has remained a securocratic state since the 1980s.  The former minister added that what happened in the country last week was a military coup, despite the defence force saying that it wasn't. He said that he thought he'd never see the removal of Mugabe. Reflecting on the major challenges the country has faced in the last few years - massive unemployment, no healthcare facilities and the power struggle within the Zanu-P - Biti said that something was bound to give.     He urged the world not to underestimate what happened in Zimbabwe, saying that once the tanks are on the streets, it is only a matter of time before they're back there. The former minister then warned the sub-Saharan region to get their finances and affairs in order, saying that if Zimbabwe implodes, it would have far reaching affects. He finished off by saying that Zimbabwe has to focus on keeping peace and stability, restoring the social contract, economic reform, structural reform, constitutional reform, harmonisation of laws, electoral reform, full stop to land question, build strong institutions, deal with the entire state and get back into the international community.
