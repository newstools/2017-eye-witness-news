                                         JOHANNESBURG - Unmarried couples in Burundi have until the end of the year to legalise their relationships through church or state registrations. In May, President Pierre Nkurunziza  signed a new law which the government says will "help protect women and create a more moral society." Nkurunziza claims a legal document recognising marriage will help protect women and their children, especially on issues such as inheritance. It's been reported mass weddings have been organised in the country as a way of enacting the presidentâ€™s orders.
