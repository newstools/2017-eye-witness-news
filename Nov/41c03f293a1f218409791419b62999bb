                                         CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Lindiwe Sisulu says that she wants to do away with "slate politics" because it destroys the party. She was responding to deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa's decision to name the five people  he would like to see elected to the party's top posts next month. Sisulu's campaign says that she was approached by Ramaphosa's team to be his running mate, but turned down the offer because she doesn't believe in slates. Campaign spokesperson Phakamile Ximiya explains: “She does not believe in slates and she also think she’s ready to give direction to the country. The issue of slates, we believe it causes challenges for the ANC, including divisions.” At a campaign rally in Limpopo at the weekend, Ramaphosa called on ANC members to elect Naledi Pandor as deputy president and Gwede Mantashe as chairperson. He also mentioned other possible candidates, including Paul Mashatile and Senzo Mchunu. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
