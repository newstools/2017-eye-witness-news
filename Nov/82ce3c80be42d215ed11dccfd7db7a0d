                                            Aubrey Modiba’s 25th minute header was enough to see SuperSport United claim a 1-0 victory over Ajax Cape Town in the only PSL match on Wednesday evening.
                                         JOHANNESBURG - Aubrey Modiba scored the only goal of the game as SuperSport United beat Ajax Cape Town at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit on Wednesday evening.  In an entertaining encounter at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit, the two teams played at a frenetic pace and created plenty of chances that neither team could capitalise on.  SuperSport were looking to redeem their CAF Confederations Cup Final loss to TP Mazembe from last week Saturday, and Modiba’s goal made sure Matsatsantsa did just that and claimed all three points on the night.  For Ajax, the loss further compounds their league woes this season as their sixth loss sees the Urban Warriors hover in the relegation zone.  Despite picking up three points, SuperSport coach Eric Tinkler was less impressed about his team’s performance on the night.  “I don’t think we played well, especially in that first half. We were lethargic and our transitional play wasn’t with enough speed.” The next round of PSL fixtures will be on Tuesday 5 December.
