                                         CAPE TOWN - A former Trillian employee turned whistle-blower has urged Members of Parliament (MPs) to get to the bottom of state capture allegations, saying she was used in a perverse project to milk state-owned enterprises. Mosilo Mothepu testified in a parliamentary inquiry into Eskom on Tuesday. She told Parliament’s Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee that suspended Eskom CFO Anoj Singh helped Trillian score deals by giving the company inside information on a memory stick. Mothepu spilt the beans on Trillian’s dealings with Eskom, telling MPs that she doesn’t believe Eskom got value for money when it paid Trillian nearly R600 million for advisory services, in the absence of signed contracts. “The invoice without contracts, without any work done. I saw that this is a pattern.” African National Congress MP Pravin Gordhan asked her to name the key personalities behind the scheme. “And as we welcome you to the world of connecting the dots, who are the key personalities in what is now emerging to you as a very systematic scheme?” Mothepu responded that Salim Essa was instrumental in getting government deals. She told lawmakers that Essa had relationships with board members of state-owned companies and the executive management of parastatals. Until recently, Essa, a Gupta family ally, was the majority shareholder at the company. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
