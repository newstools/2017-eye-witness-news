                                         CAPE TOWN - The South African agriculture sector has reported more than 100,000 job losses countrywide so far this year.  The bulk of the cuts have been in the Western Cape.  The persistent drought in the province remains one of the key factors for the job shedding.  After cutting 84,000 jobs in the first half of this year, the agricultural sector has seen a further 25,000 cuts in the third quarter.  Agriculture and Economic Development MEC Alan Winde says millions of rands are being lost in potato and onion crops in Ceres alone. “We are now in the third year of a serious drought and now you can start to see the effects in the agriculture. We know that in Ceres already, 80% of the potato crop is not being planted.” Summer crop-producing provinces may see an uptick in production in this final quarter.  But not many job opportunities are expected.
