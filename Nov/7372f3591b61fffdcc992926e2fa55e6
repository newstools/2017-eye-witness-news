                                         CAPE TOWN - Another gruelling week of cross-examination by the State lies ahead for triple murder accused Henri van Breda. The 23-year-old is accused of killing his parents and older brother at their De Zalze home outside Stellenbosch in January 2015. The State has been questioning Van Breda, largely trying to poke holes in his testimony. Van Breda last week had to demonstrate in the Western Cape High Court how he allegedly fought with a masked assailant following the attacks on his family. He also had to show how the attacker hit his brother and father with an axe.  Prosecutor Susan Galloway has assured the court that she will be going through another chunky section in her cross-examination on Monday. Galloway has been testing Van Breda's claim that a masked attacker had been behind the attacks on his family. She questioned several inconsistencies between his testimony and the police statement he had signed on the day of the triple murders. Van Breda explained that the police statement wasn't entirely correct and had not been written verbatim by the officer who'd noted it down.  Galloway pressed Van Breda about why the two intruders he says were in the house that night didn't steal anything.  She further probed why he didn't do anything to stop the attacker from killing his family. WATCH: Van Breda re-enacts scuffle with alleged intruder  (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
