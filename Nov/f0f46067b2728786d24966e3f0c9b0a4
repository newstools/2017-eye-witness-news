Eleven people have been confirmed dead after the taxi boss and four of his guards were ambushed on a highway causing their car to crash into a minibus, killing five people. A sixth person from the second vehicle died on arrival at hospital. Eyewitness News understands that on Monday, a member of one of the associations was also murdered.    Both the Klipriver and Sizwe Taxi Associations are claiming to be the rightful owners of routes in the area but a court has ruled in favour of the Klipriver group. Spokesperson Mluleki Mntungwa says: “Just last week, the MEC for Transport Mxolisi Kaunda in KwaZulu-Natal, was in Ladysmith to meet with the two associations and we agreed that they will put a stop to this ongoing violence.”
