                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police have arrested a teenager for allegedly slitting the throat of a seven-year-old schoolmate in the hopes the murder would lead to an exam being postponed. The 16-year-old is accused of killing his young schoolmate in September at a smart private school near Delhi in India in an attempt to delay an impending test and parent-teacher meeting. Police had initially detained a bus conductor over the murder, claiming he killed the boy after the young pupil resisted a sex attack. But police have now revealed the arrest of the teenager, who admitted during questioning that he wanted to put off exams.
