                                         JOHANNESBURG - Tensions are brewing around the placing of the motion of no confidence vote in Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and Speaker Vasco da Gama on the council agenda. The African National Congress (ANC) wants its motion against Mashaba and Da Gama for mismanagement of the city to be heard first thing on Wednesday morning. But the mayor says the party can't dictate the placing or timing of the items on the agenda. The ANC's Jolidee Matongo says that to avoid a two-day council sitting polarised by tensions, the vote of no confidence must be heard first thing this morning. But Mashaba says there are certain rules that need to be followed. The ANC says if the motion succeeds and Mashaba is voted out as mayor, the city manager will take over mayoral responsibilities while an opposition parties committee will work on a date to elect a new mayor in January.
