                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom  says it has healthy stockpiles across its coal-fired power stations ahead of a potential coal wage strike by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). The utility says its working tirelessly to reclaim coal from current stockpiles, as well as build up operational stockpiles to mitigate the impact of this impending strike. The NUM is aiming to strike from Sunday after wage talks broke down last week. At the same time, Eskom says it's trying to stabilise its financial situation and will continue to recover funds from municipalities across the country. An internal Eskom report has painted an alarming picture of funding difficulties and declining liquidity at the power utility. Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe said: “Which in total is R11.2 billion and we’ll also continue to do self-cost cutting measures internally, which does not include the retrenchments at this stage. We’ll just continue to do other things without compromising the quality of work we need to do at our power stations.”
