                                         CAPE TOWN - Day zero has arrived for Beaufort West. The Central Karoo town has run out of dam water.  Residents now rely on boreholes and recycled sewage water. The Western Cape Local Government Department's James-Brent Styan says that the Gamka Dam, which is the main source of drinking water for Beaufort West residents is empty.  “It's no longer usable to provide water to the town of 37,000 people. Beaufort West is currently relying on about 34 boreholes and seeking funding to drill an additional five more.” There are now fears boreholes could soon hit rock bottom as well. It's a sobering reminder for Cape Town where daily water consumption has increased. Last week, dam storage levels declined by 0,7% to 37,8% (27,8% useable water) in Cape Town. Collective usage was at 602 million litres per day. This is 102 million litres above what is required for the city to get through the drought. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
