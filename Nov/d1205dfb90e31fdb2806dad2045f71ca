                                         DURBAN - With the deadline for African National Congress (ANC) branch general meetings fast approaching, on Wednesday afternoon the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) is disputing the progress update provided by secretary-general Gwede Mantashe. During a briefing last week, the KZN ANC announced that 60% of the branch meetings had nominated its leadership. But on Tuesday Mantashe announced that 40% had convened so far. The ANC in KZN has moved to clarify that the numbers provided by Mantashe during Tuesday’s briefing were not up to date. But it insists that there’s no tension between the provincial and national office. The KZN ANC says they’ve resolved nearly half of 36 appeals that have been lodged and there have been no new complaints since last week.
