                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg says that it’s hoping to meet with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and other parties to get their support for a planned no confidence motion in Mayor Herman Mashaba. This will be the ANC’s second attempt to push Mashaba and Speaker of the City Council Vasco da Gama out of their positions. The party filed papers on Friday for the motion to be heard later this month, a move Mashaba has dismissed as frivolous. The ANC’s Jolidee Matongo says that they have already secured the votes of 15 Democratic Alliance council members. “We’ll be engaging with the EFF in the coming two weeks to try and make sure that they are supportive of the motion.  “We’re quite aware of the fact that their national leadership is the one in this instance making the call on whether they will support the motion or abstain.”
