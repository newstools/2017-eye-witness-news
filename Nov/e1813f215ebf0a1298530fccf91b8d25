                                         JOHANNESBURG - One of the women who was assaulted by former Deputy Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Manana has spoken out about the sentence handed down to him. Manana beat up three women at a restaurant in Fourways in August and pleaded guilty to the crime after a video went viral. Magistrate Ramsamy Reddy sentenced Manana to either a year’s imprisonment or an R100,000 fine, along with 500 hours of community service. Mandisa Duma was seen held down by Manana’s friends as he beat her. Pictures of her bruised body were seen on social media following the incident at Cubana in Fourways. Duma says the sentence isn’t heavy enough for the crime. “If you compare the pain and everything else that we’ve been through to Manana’s sentence; it doesn’t balance. The only thing that would really equate that would be jail time. But it is what it is."  Duma says she’s disappointed at the judgment and is struggling to move on.
