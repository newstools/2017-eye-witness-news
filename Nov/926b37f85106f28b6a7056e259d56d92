He says he wants the ANC to come up with policies that will reposition the country including returning the land to its rightful owners. “We want our land back and we want the land to be in the hands of our people. We’re going to make sure that land is put back in the hands of our people.” #CR17 arrives, crowd sings "maka  Hambu Zuma", Cyril dances but doesn't sing the part that says Zuma must go.

Zuma made changes to his Cabinet in October, which saw Nzimande being axed as higher education minister. Addressing a cadres' assembly in Witbank, Mpumalanga SACP Secretary Bonakele Majuba criticised the president's decision. “That is why we’re saying instead of the general secretary being reshuffled, the person who reshuffled him, was to supposed to reshuffle himself.”
