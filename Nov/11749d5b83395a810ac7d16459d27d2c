                                         JOHANNESBURG - NGO Earthlife Africa is expected to march to Eskom's Braamfontein offices today to highlight the dangers of nuclear and appeal to the government not to go ahead with any plans. The march is also to highlight the unaffordable electricity hike proposal of more than 19% which could result in consumers paying 27% more for power next year. The NGO says marchers will hold a picket outside the Eksom office expressing their views that nuclear is not safe for the country and will only create more debt. Earthlife Africa's Thabo Sibeko said, “It’s dangerous for people’s health and for the environment. It will cripple our budget.” It’s being reported that President Jacob Zuma appointed David Mahlobo to energy minister during his latest cabinet reshuffle in hope to fast-track the nuclear plan before he leaves office in December.
