                                         LOS ANGELES - Charles Manson (83), the cult leader who sent followers known as the 'Manson Family' out to commit gruesome murders, has reportedly died. TMZ is reporting that the sister of his most famous victim received a call from the prison telling her Manson had died. In the 1960s, Manson, an ex-convict, assembled a group of runaways and outcasts known as the 'Manson Family'.  In the summer of 1969, he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war. Among the victims was actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski. She was stabbed 16 times by cult members. Debra Tate has told TMZ she received a call from the prison telling her Manson died 8:13 PM Sunday. Additional reporting by Reuters.
