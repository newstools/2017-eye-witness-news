                                         CAPE TOWN - The case against a Bonteheuwel resident accused of raping a seven-year-old girl has again been postponed. The 53-year-old man appeared in the Bishop Lavis Magistrates Court on Monday. He allegedly gave the child a five-rand coin after raping her in the bathroom of his house in July. The girl lives in a backyard dwelling on the accused's property. Ward councillor Angus Mckenzie said: “The case was once again postponed up to 10 December for a final consultation. By which time the case will then be transferred to the Parow Regional Court. I want to make it very clear that we are relentless in our pursuit of ensuring that justice is served.”
