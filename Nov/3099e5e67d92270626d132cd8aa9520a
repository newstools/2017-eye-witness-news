                                         JOHANNESBURG - Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter included goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune in his starting line-up for the World Cup qualifier against Senegal in Polokwane on Friday evening. Bafana’s preparations for the match have been marred by various injuries, suspensions and a call-up snub from midfielder Thulani Serero.  Khune had been struggling with a facial injury picked up during Kaizer Chiefs’ 1-0 Telkom Knock Out victory over Chippa United last Sunday.  The Chiefs goal-minder will be wearing a protective mask, going through training unscathed. The back four of Clayton Daniels, Morgan Gould, Sifiso Hlanti and Thamsanqa Mkhize is unchanged from Bafana’s last qualifier against Burkina Faso last month.  Dean Furman and Lebogang Manyama come in for the suspended duo of Bongani Zungu and Andile Jali, while the rest of the team is rounded up by Sibusiso Vilakazi and Percy tau. Regular captain Thulani Hlatshwayo misses out on selection due to a toe injury. Bafana’s head-to-head record against the Lions of Teranga makes for an interesting read. The two sides have played each other seven times with Bafana winning one, drawing four times and losing two.  The equation for South Africa is to win both games against Senegal and they will be through to Russia 2018.  The full line-up is as follows: Itumeleng Khune Clayton Daniels Morgan Gould Thamsanqa Mkhize Sifiso Hlanti Dean Furman Kamohelo Mokotjo Lebogang Manyama Themba Zwane Sibusiso Vilakazi Percy Tau Kick-off at the Peter Mokaba Stadium is at 19h00.
