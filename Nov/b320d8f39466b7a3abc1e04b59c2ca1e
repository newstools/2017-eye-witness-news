                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former President Thabo Mbeki has lashed out at the African National Congress (ANC)’s national executive committee (NEC) for disassociating itself from a consultative conference organised by its own stalwarts, saying that the leadership has done a disservice to the party. Mbeki was speaking on the last day of the ANC stalwarts' consultative conference on Sunday. The former president says it cannot be correct that the ANC has distanced itself from the consultative conference.  “The national executive committee, I think, has done itself and the African National Congress and the rest of the ANC a great disservice by disassociating itself from this leadership which has been gathered.”  WATCH: ANC stalwarts' consultative conference wraps up  He says the party’s NEC should have joined forces with the stalwarts. “It was a wrong decision and I trust that there must surely still be people within the NEC of the ANC who can think.” Mbeki also took some time to speak about the state of the ANC, describing it as captured by a dominant faction that is not ANC and infested by a rot. Mbeki said that the ANC needs to be recaptured. "It is clear that the ANC has been captured by a dominant faction which, in fact, is not ANC. But really what we are dealing with is a rot that has infested the organisation as a whole." He said he is surprised by what happens in the ANC. "When you wake up in the morning and see a report of money that was supposed to have gone to some municipality has been stolen... that can't be ANC." Mbeki said that the ANC needs to be liberated from the clutches of those who have captured it. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
