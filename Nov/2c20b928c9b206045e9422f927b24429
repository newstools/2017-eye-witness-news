                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Council of Churches has urged Zimbabwean nationals living in the country to go home and take part in what it has labelled the process of transformation. Secretary Gift Moerane says the Zimbabwean nationals should take responsibility as the civil society prepares for the scheduled 2018 general elections. Speaking at the Zimbabwe Solidarity Forum-Civil Society Conference in Johannesburg, Moerane says raising voices while in foreign countries would not aid the situation. “Hope is in their hands, they must be responsible citizens of Zimbabwe and help their country move forward. They have brains, the know-how and knowledge of what should happen to make Zimbabwe a better country.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
