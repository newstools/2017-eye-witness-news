                                         JOHANNESBURG - With more allegations of sexual misconduct now emerging against soccer boss Danny Jordaan, his lawyer says he will welcome any criminal charges so that he can prove his innocence in court. Last month former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Jennifer Ferguson posted a Facebook blog post in which she alleged that Jordaan raped her in a Port Elizabeth hotel more than 20 years ago. Jordaan, who has kept his silence for more than two weeks, is expected to release a statement on Wednesday. Speaking on the Karima Brown Show last night on 702, Jordaan’s lawyer Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi stressed that the Safa boss would only respond to fresh sexual assault claims made by at least two other women once details become available. “Clearly we can’t respond to allegations of certain individuals. We’d need to know specifically who these individuals are.” Meanwhile, in another twist, Ferguson claims that Jordaan’s former lawyer contacted the father of her child asking him for any information that could discredit her. “So that was an indication that there was no real interest in mediation. On the contrary, they have embarked on a campaign to discredit my integrity.” Jordaan’s legal team has advised him not to say anything in public.  A statement is expected during the course of the day.
