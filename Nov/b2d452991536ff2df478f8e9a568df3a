                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Warriors and Cobras claimed important victories in the second round of the T20 Challenge double-header action at Newlands on Sunday. The Eastern Cape franchise had been without a win in their previous four games of the tournament, and are still languishing at the bottom of the table. The Lions set a Newlands record total of 183 for the Warriors to chase, as Reeza Hendricks continued his rich vein of form, scoring a fine 81 off 63 balls. Rassie van der Dussen’s 45 off 30 balls and a quick fire 41 off 23 from young Ryan Rickleton boosted the Lions' total.  The Warriors’ chase didn’t get off to the best possible start, as the side lost the wickets of captain Jon-Jon Smuts and Gihahn Cloete for 10 and 1 respectively. The departure of Smuts and Cloete brought about the match-winning partnership between Colin Ingram (89 off 48) and Christian Jonker (39 off 28). The pair put on 93 for the 5th wicket that helped the Warriors seal victory. Lesiba Ngoepe and Jerry Nqolo finished off the match with an over to spare.  In the second game of the double-header, the Cobras beat the Knights by three wickets, with JP Duminy scoring his third half century of the competition. Batting first, the Knights set a modest target of 159 with David Miller and Theunis de Bruyn scoring 50 and 40 runs respectively.  Hashim Amla and Duminy provided much of the Cobras runs but the Knights clawed their way back by picking up wickets consistently. Veteran all-rounders, Vernon Philander and Rory Kleinveldt sealed the victory for the Cobras inside the final over.
