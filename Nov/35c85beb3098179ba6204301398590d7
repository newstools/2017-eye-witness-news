                                         JOHANNESBURG - The biography of former Bafana Bafana and Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Teko Modise titled ‘The Curse of Teko Modise’ will be officially launched on 28 November. The book is already in bookstores around the country and it reveals Modise’s trials and tribulations during his football and personal life.  The book offers details of Modise's failed marriage, excessive drinking and the time he consulted a medicine man from Congo to break his title-winning drought. It also gives readers insight into his childhood, where he was kicked out of his home at eight years old because of his love for football, ironically the same thing that catapulted him to stardom.  ‘The Navigator’ as the South African football fraternity fondly refers to Modise, has played for various clubs in the Premier Soccer league, having started his career at SuperSport United before making a big money move to Soweto giants Orlando Pirates. Modise’s tumultuous time at Pirates ended when he joined Mamelodi Sundowns where he won the CAF Champions League in 2016.
