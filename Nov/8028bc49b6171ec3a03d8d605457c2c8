                                         JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the size of President Jacob Zuma’s Cabinet must be thought through, saying efforts to cut costs and save money must start from the top. Ramaphosa was answering questions in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on Wednesday afternoon. He was asked if he has ever considered the possibility of reducing the size of Cabinet. In his response, he said given the current economic difficulties more efforts must be made to cut costs. “If you were to reduce the size of your executive, it would save quite a lot of cost. These are matters that need to be given thought to. We also need to give thought to where we can cut costs.”
