                                         CAPE TOWN - Transport MEC Donald Grant has expressed concern over safety on the rail network following the shooting of a Metrorail  official in Cape Town. A Protection Service officer was shot in the chest near the Bonteheuwel-Netreg area on Thursday morning. Mkululani Nelani (31) was on duty when his patrol vehicle was shot at and is fighting for his life in hospital. Metrorail says a colleague reported that they were shot at when they approached four men near the tracks. Grant says violent crimes like the shooting of Mkululani Nelani, threatens Metrorail's ability to run a safe and reliable public transport system and the livelihood of commuters. “The Western Cape government condemns the shooting of a Prasa employee who was attempting to fix things in the rail reserve and ended up being shot.” Metrorail says the Bonteheuwel-Netreg area is the most dangerous section on its network. It also services the most commuters. Metrorail spends more money on fixing damages due to vandalism on this line than on any other in the province. Only two of the four lines on this route have been operable for the past few months due to vandalised signalling.
