                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe's former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa has reportedly been fired from the ruling Zanu-PF party. Zimbabwe media says the decision was taken during a party meeting on Wednesday, where all 10 provincial committees agreed. The development comes just two days after he was fired by President Robert Mugabe  for various allegations, including undermining the president. President Mugabe  made his first public comments on the sacking of Mnangagwa on Wednesday. He said his former second in command was deviant and needs to go back to ideology school. Mugabe compared Mnangagwa to former vice president Joice Mujuru, who was sacked three years ago for allegedly plotting to take over from him. According to quotes carried by the state-run Herald online, Mugabe said Mnangagwa was deviant and lacks the discipline needed to be a leader. He suggested the veteran nationalist be retrained in party ideology. There were calls on Wednesday by some officials to purge Zanu-PF, as well as government departments and state-run firms of all those perceived to be loyal to Mnangagwa.
