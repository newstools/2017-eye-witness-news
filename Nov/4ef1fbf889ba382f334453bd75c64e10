Luleka Khunjuwa says that her sister had been a patient at the Life Esidimeni facility in Randfontein since 1975 but died just six months after being taken to Takalani Home in Soweto. JOHANNESBURG - A woman whose sister died after being moved from an Esidimeni facility says that she was in and out of hospital during her six-month stay at the Takalani Home in Soweto because the NGO had no doctors and insufficient medication. Luleka Khunjuwa is testifying at the arbitration hearings in Parktown. Her sister Maureen is one of 141 psychiatric patients who died after the Gauteng Health Department moved them from Life Esidimeni facilities to illegal NGOs. Khunjuwa says that her sister Maureen was born brain damaged. An autopsy report read out at the Esidimeni arbitration hearings in Parktown on Thursday, says that Maureen was born with cerebral palsy which could mean she was deprived of oxygen during birth. She had been a patient at the Life Esidimeni facility in Randfontein since 1975 but died just six months after being taken to Takalani Home in Soweto. Her sister Khunjuwa says that her sisterâ€™s health kept deteriorating and she was continuously admitted at the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital. Her testimony continues.
