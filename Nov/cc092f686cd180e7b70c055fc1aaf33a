                                         HARARE - The youth wing of President Robert Mugabe’s party has strongly criticised the commander of the defence force for threatening to take corrective measures against the Zanu-PF. Youth Secretary Kudzai Chipanga has accused Commander Constantine Chiwenga of overstepping his boundaries. This was the first public reaction from a Zanu-PF official to Monday’s threat by Chiwenga to intervene in the party’s affairs. In a statement issued at a media conference on Tuesday, Chipanga said Zimbabwe was at peace, and therefore martial law has no place in the party. Chiwenga on Monday ordered the ruling party to stop expelling war veterans from its ranks, an apparent reference to last week’s sacking of vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. But in a counter-statement, the Zanu-PF youth leader says the expulsion of Mnangagwa shows democracy is at play, adding Chiwenga cannot dictate who will lead the party and country.
