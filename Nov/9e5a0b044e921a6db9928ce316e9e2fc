                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  says an inquiry into the South African Revenue Service (Sars) is long overdue, although it may be difficult for the revenue service to ever regain its integrity. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced this week that an inquiry will be set up to probe Sars. Commissioner Tom Moyane has been accused of playing an instrumental role in protecting President Jacob Zuma in Jacques Pauw's new book The President's Keepers. The EFF's Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has told Talk Radio 702 & Cape Talk an inquiry is necessary. “Under Gigaba, this government and the administration of Jacob Zuma, it is very doubtful that Sars can recover its integrity and the public confidence it used to enjoy through an inquiry that is constituted by this administration.” LISTEN: Zuma gives green light to Sars investigation
