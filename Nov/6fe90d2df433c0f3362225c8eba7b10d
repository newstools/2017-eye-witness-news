                                         JOHANNESBURG – Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa has again spoken out against state capture. Ramaphosa proposed what he calls a new deal to take South Africa forward. He delivered an address at an ANC event on Monday night. Ramaphosa, who was accompanied by his wife, was warmly welcomed and was again referred to as the incoming president.  He says that something bold needs to be done to transform the economy, proposing what he calls a “new deal”. “We need to reassert the independence of institutions which support democracy, fight corruption and safeguard the welfare of our nation. We need to safeguard these institutions and not harm them.” Ramaphosa says part of the new deal would be to restore investor confidence and create more jobs in partnership with the private sector.
