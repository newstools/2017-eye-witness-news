                                         CAPE TOWN - Former energy minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson is all set for a very merry Christmas; she's to get a bumper bonus of more than R2 million. The once-off gratuity is provided for in Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba's adjusted budget. Joemat-Pettersson resigned as a Member of Parliament a few days after President Jacob Zuma sacked her when he reshuffled his Cabinet in March this year. Under Joemat-Pettersson’s watch, South Africa’s strategic oil stocks were sold off in a dubious deal at bargain-basement prices. While she claimed this was a rotation of stock, her successor Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane confirmed the oil was sold. DA MP Gavin Davis wants to know why Joemat-Pettersson, who lied to parliament, is now being rewarded. “Why should we give Joemat-Pettersson a R2.1 million golden handshake when she personally organised the theft of our oil reserves at a cost of R2 billion to the economy?” The money to pay Joemat-Pettersson is being shifted from the national solar water heater project. It seems that neither Energy Minister David Mahlobo nor his deputy Thembi Majola were in the house to answer his questions. The vote was approved and the Payment will now go through, in spite of objections from the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters.
