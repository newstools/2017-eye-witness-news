                                         CAPE TOWN - A Metrorail protection service officer shot while on patrol in the Bonteheuwel-Netreg area will undergo surgery this week.  Mkululi Nelani was shot when he and a partner approached four men standing near tracks during the early hours of Thursday morning.  Metrorail’s regional manager Richard Walker and Transport MEC Donald Grant visited the 31-year-old at Vincent Pallotti Hospital earlier on Tuesday. Nelani sat on a chair next to his hospital bed, writhing in pain as he tried to speak to Eyewitness News about his traumatic experience.  “I thought I was going to lose my life,” he whispers as he winces… eyes tightly shut.  The father of two, who’s been working for Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) for seven years, will soon undergo surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his liver. Grant thanks him for his service and promises to support him.  “I want to thank you and I’m really sorry about this. We’re grateful that you’re alive.” There’ve been more than 12 attacks on Metrorail officials in the Western Cape this year. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
