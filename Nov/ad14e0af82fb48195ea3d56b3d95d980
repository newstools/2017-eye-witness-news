There’s been opposition to Eskom’s application to energy regulator Nersa for a 19.9% hike in the price of electricity. JOHANNESBURG - Members of National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) will picket outside Eskom’s headquarters on Thursday to express unhappiness over several issues, including a looming electricity tariff increase. There’s been opposition to Eskom’s application to energy regulator Nersa for a 19.9% hike in the price of electricity. Numsa has also been vocal about allegations of state capture and corruption at Eskom. The union's spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi says: “Numsa and the United Front will be handing over a memorandum of demands focusing on some of these issues: Eskom’s outrageous request for a 19.9% tariff increase, corruption of Eskom management and board, labour brokering and an end to the apartheid wage gap in the Eskom workplace.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
