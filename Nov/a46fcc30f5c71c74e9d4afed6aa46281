                                         JOHANNESBURG - A controversial set of amendments to Kenya’s electoral act have become law just days after a divisive presidential poll boycotted by the opposition. The amendments, condemned by the opposition as well as Kenya’s foreign allies, were automatically gazetted after President-elect Uhuru Kenyatta failed to sign the bill within 14 days or send it back to parliament. Lawmakers from Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party introduced the amendments after the Supreme Court annulled the 8 August election due to irregularities and mismanagement by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. This week, opposition leader Raila Odinga said he would use pickets and petitions to protest last week’s presidential poll and convene a “People’s Assembly” to try to improve governance but made no mention of challenging the result. “We will guard our right to dissent by exercising it,” Odinga said in a long-awaited television address. He emphasised that he wanted to limit his protests to well-recognised, legal avenues.
