                                         CAPE TOWN - Eskom’s former Finance Director has revealed details about what she calls a disregard for the state-owned company's procurement processes during Zola Tsotsi’s tenure as chairperson of the board. Tsholofelo Molefe has been testifying in a parliamentary inquiry into allegations of state capture at the parastatal. Molefe described the lengths Tsotsi and then-acting CEO Collin Matjila were willing to go to sign off on deals with Gupta-linked companies. Members of Parliament have heard that Matjila signed a R43 million, multi-year deal with The New Age newspaper even though he was not authorised to do so. Matjila and Tsosti also wanted to approve a deal with Regiments Capital as a matter of urgency. They did not want to be hamstrung by “long-winded procurement processes,” Molefe told lawmakers. “Zola Tsotsi indicated that we are wasting time with long-winded procurement processes suggested to me that he had no regard for those procurement regulations.” State-owned enterprises with massive spending budgets like Eskom are bound by a detailed regulatory framework that governs how officials purchase goods and services. These rules ensure the prudent and lawful use of public funds. Molefe was among a handful of Eskom executives who were suspended by the board in March 2015. She believes she was punished for refusing to sign off on certain things such as The New Age and Regiments deals. #EskomInquiry T. Molefe tells of a meeting with Salim Essa who told her that Regiments capital could assist Eskom with a financial stability plan.
