                                         JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says former director of mental health in Gauteng Makgabo Manamela should now be reported to the South African Nursing Council for ethical misconduct for her role in the Esidimeni tragedy. Manamela lost her bid to appeal the findings made against her by the health ombudsman. One-hundred-and-forty-one mentally ill patients died after the Gauteng Health Department terminated its contract with Life Esidimeni. The independent ad hoc tribunal headed by retired judge president of the High Court Bernard Ngoepe dismissed Doctor Manamela’s appeal recently. The tribunal was established by Motsoaledi in March this year. Motsoaledi says this shows that health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba’s findings against Manamela are true. “Meaning the Gauteng Health Department has got a right to take her through a disciplinary process and we must also report her to the nursing council for ethical misconduct. The judge confirmed that the health ombudsman was actually correct in everything he said.” A verdict on former provincial health HOD Doctor Barney Selebano’s appeal is yet to be heard.
