                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Automobile Association is predicting a massive increase of up to 76 cents a litre for petrol this festive season. It’s predicting a 72 cents hike for both grades of petrol, 64 cents for diesel and 76 cents for illuminating paraffin.    The association has attributed the potential increases to the weakening rand and a rise in international petroleum prices. The AA’s Layton Beard says: “Sharp movements in international petroleum prices combined with the weakening rand to push fuel prices higher for December.  “Oil has continued the strong run we have seen throughout November and the trend remains upwards.” The Energy Department is expected to make the official announcement on fuel prices before next Wednesday.
