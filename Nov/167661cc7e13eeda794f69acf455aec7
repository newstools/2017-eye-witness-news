In recent months, there’s been a surge in drilling for private boreholes in Cape Town. CAPE TOWN - The World Wide Fund (WWF) for nature is pushing for legislation changes regarding private boreholes. The organisation on Wednesday presented its concerns on the over-abstraction of groundwater. It is one of a host of measures that authorities are resorting to in the Cape to deal with the drought. In recent months, there’s been a surge in drilling for private boreholes in Cape Town. The WWF's Christine Colvin is worried. “While there are several recommendations about not using even borehole water for washing your paving and watering your garden, I think we need to explore as to whether the city has the authority to put that restriction in place.” The City of Cape Town has yet to give clarity on this issue.
