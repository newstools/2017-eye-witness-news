                                         JOHANNESBURG – An American woman has become the first openly transgender person to win a state legislative race after being elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrat Danica Roem (33) beat long-time Republican incumbent Bob Marshall (73), a socially conservative and vocal anti-LGBT lawmaker who wrote the Physical Privacy Act which would have required people to use the restroom that corresponded with the gender on their original birth certificates. In 2006 Marshall also authored a constitutional amendment which defined marriage as between one man and one woman. He is also fiercely against abortion. The Independent reports that during the election campaign, Marshall refused to use Roem’s correct pronouns in the campaign.  He also later diluted the legislation’s language to eliminate the word ‘original’, but denounced the Republican committee who rejected the bill as ‘disgusting’. In September, Roem posted a web video in which she hit back at her opponent’s refusal to debate her or to refer to her as a woman. WATCH: Just who I am  “To every person who’s ever been singled out, who’s ever been stigmatised, who’s ever been the misfit, whose ever been the kid in the corner, whose ever needed someone to stand up for them when they didn’t have a voice of their own … This one’s for you,” Roem told supporters after winning the vote. Roem is a former journalist and sings in a thrash metal band called Cab Ride Home. She started transitioning while working at a newspaper in 2012, began hormone replacement therapy in 2013, and changed her name, gender and byline in 2015.
