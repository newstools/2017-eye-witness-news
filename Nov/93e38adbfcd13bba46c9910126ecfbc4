                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former Proteas bowling coach Charl Langeveldt says that he doesn’t harbour any ill feelings after he was relieved of his duties as bowling coach. Ottis Gibson, who has recently been appointed as head coach of the Proteas, will also take up the role of bowling coach, which he was employed in at his previous job with the England national side. Langeveldt was one of South Africa’s death overs specialist during his playing days and enjoyed much success as a bowling coach, which included a 5-0 ODI whitewash of Australia in September 2016. Speaking to EWN Sport, Langeveldt says that if Gibson wasn’t a head coach himself, he would have stayed on. “Ottis is a bowling coach himself. So I think he wasn’t to double up on that responsibility too, but there certainly no hard feelings.” Says Langeveldt. Langeveldt says he still has ambitions of coaching at an international level again. “The international level is where you want to be as a coach and winning world cups, so I’d like to return to the international scene again.” The Proteas will next face Zimbabwe in a four-day, day-night Test match at St Georges Park on 26 December.
