                                         JOHANNESBURG - Members of Parliament have paid tribute to the former leader of the Freedom Front Plus Pieter Mulder who is bowing out after nearly three decades in Parliament. Mulder served under both the apartheid regime and the new democratic order and was Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries between 2009 and 2014. He handed over his party leadership reins to Pieter Groenewald in 2016. Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor says despite political differences, she never had reason to doubt Mulder’s commitment to the country. “To me, Dr Mulder is a true South Africa [even though] we don’t always agree [with each other].” A visibly emotional Mulder told the house he felt honoured. “There is a political saying that all political careers end in tears, now with my decision to voluntarily resign as an MP, I’m trying to avoid exactly that.”
