The 93-year-old Mugabe has held power in the southern African nation since independence from Britain in 1980 Grace told a Zanu-pf rally that the party would amend its constitution this month and the changes would be adopted at a special December congress, to ensure that one of Mugabe's two deputies would be a woman. The First Lady has recently publicly rebuked Zimbabwe's Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, saying the vice presidentâ€™s continued claims that he recently survived poisoning were nonsensical. Mnangagwa and the first lady are said to be in different factions vying for control of the ruling party.
