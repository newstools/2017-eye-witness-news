                                         JOHANNESBURG - While the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) won’t be drawn on the latest resignation, Rachel Kalidass has spoken out on her decision to step down from the board, saying the current environment is not conducive. Kalidass resigned earlier on Thursday after raising concerns about the board’s first choice for the position of CEO, whom she claims has allegations of fraud and corruption hanging over his head. She says the candidate, named by the Democratic Alliance (DA) as Alan Mukoki, is conflicted when it comes to the public broadcaster. Kalidass served on the SABC board before... however, was removed two years ago for opposing the permanent appointment of the public broadcaster’s former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. She says she decided to call it quits this time because she’s uncomfortable with the board’s decision. “The appointment of the executive, especially the CEO, is the most important decision that the board will make and at this point in time we need to restore stability and integrity.” Her resignation is the first since the new board took office just a month ago. DA REACTS Meanwhile, the DA says Kalidass’ resignation from the SABC board is a sign that bad times are back at the public broadcaster. DA spokesperson Phumzile van Dam said: ”The DA sees Kalidass’s resignation as an indication that it’s back to business as usual at the SABC… and business as usual being the return of the bad times that led to the SABC inquiry in 2016.”    Rachel Kalidass Resignation by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
