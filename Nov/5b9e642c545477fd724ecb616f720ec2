                                         CAPE TOWN - A neurologist says the condition family axe murder accused Henri van Breda has been diagnosed with is uncommon in adults. The court on Monday heard the 23-year-old was diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy after suffering a seizure last week. It has led to the defence requesting that it be allowed to call a neurologist to testify on the condition. The Epilepsy Foundation states first seizures associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy usually occur between the ages of five and 16. But Wits University neurology professor Girish Modi says sometimes it can be diagnosed in adults. “It can happen but it's uncommon. But if it happens in the 20s or the 30s or whatever then you start investigating. So, you might be calling it JME but it might be myoclonic epilepsy caused by something else.” Van Breda claims he blacked out for about two hours and 45 minutes on the night of the attack. State doctors found there were no signs of brain damage and he had no pre-disposed condition that could've led to it.
