                                         JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says that a task team roped in to help run the Gauteng Health Department will focus on critical areas, including skills development. The four-member team of experts was announced by the minister on Sunday. It comes on the back of many problems plaguing the department, including how the Esidimeni tragedy unfolded as well as human resources and financial management.  Motsoaledi says this does not mean Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa’s powers will be limited.  “She is in charge of this. This is a management team, it is not a political structure. The team will be managed by her. She needs a competent team to help her. She can’t do all these things by herself.” Meanwhile, Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa is confident a new intervention team will help clean up the various crises facing the department. Ramokgopa says that many inconsistencies in the health system have been exposed by the Life Esidimeni tragedy and they are now working to fix the problems. “If we don’t hold accountable those in the leadership, those in the service, we’re likely to have problems like the ones we’ve had with the Life Esidimeni tragedy.” Additional reporting by Koketso Motau.
