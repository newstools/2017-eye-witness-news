The 24-year-old grime artist wrote a number of tweets in which he used slurs against gay people whilst watching the BBC series ‘School For Stars’. LONDON - Grime star Stormzy has apologised on Twitter for posting a number of tweets in the past in which he used homophobic language. The 24-year-old grime artist - whose real name is Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo, Jr. - wrote a number of tweets in which he used slurs against gay people whilst watching the BBC series School For Stars. One of the tweets - which has now been deleted - read: “Put it on BBC1 this little black boy is a f--king fag (sic).” And in another tweet back in November 2011, the Shut Up hitmaker made remarks about EastEnders couple Christian and Syed saying: “Looooooool u see syed run into christians arms. F--king fag (sic).” Stormzy is now asking for forgiveness from the LGBTQ community and his “supporters and friends” in the wake of YouTube personalities Jack Maynard and Zoella coming under fire for similarly unacceptable comments they made on social media. In his apology, Stormzy wrote on Twitter: “I said some foul and offensive things whilst tweeting years ago at a time when I was young and proudly ignorant. Very hurtful and discriminative views that I’ve unlearned as I’ve grown up and become a man. The comments I made were unacceptable and disgusting, full stop. Comments that I regret and to everyone I’ve offended, I am sorry, these are attitudes I’ve left in the past. “The homophobic language I used was, embarrassingly, a part of my vocabulary when I was younger and ignorance made me feel comfortable to use them whilst not understanding the hate and the ramifications they carry. That isn’t an excuse, I take responsibility for my mistakes and hope you can understand that my younger self-doesn't reflect who I am today. Again, I’m sorry to everyone I’ve offended. To the LGBTQ community and my supporters and friends, my deepest apologies (sic)”
