                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Metro Police have indicated they will take further action against illegal liquor outlets. Officials have on Wednesday briefed the Provincial Legislature’s Standing Committee on Community Safety on their plans for the 2017/2018 financial year. They have again emphasised officers need the public’s help in the fight against crime. Metro police chief Wayne Le Roux has told the committee they will continue to support the police in the fight against drugs and illegal alcohol trading. He says they will join forces to further cut down illegal liquor outlets throughout the city. Le Roux says, already, fines worth R1.3 million have been issued and more than R700,000 has been collected. “We’re still concerned about the number of drunk drivers and we’d like to appeal to people to be more responsible. Make alternative arrangements when, especially, you’re going out to party. And people coming to beaches; don’t drink and drive, don’t drink on the beaches. Alcohol will be confiscated, we’re taking a zero tolerance.” He says they will also prioritise traffic violations, especially drunk driving. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
