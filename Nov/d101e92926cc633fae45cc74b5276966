                                         JOHANNESBURG - Two mine workers who were trapped underground at AngloGold Ashanti's Mponeng Mine in Carletonville have been rescued alive. The mine says the men are in a stable condition and have been sent to the nearest health centre. Two other miners died earlier on Thursday in what the company says was a seismic event at the world's deepest mine. Four others were subsequently rescued. Spokesperson Chris Nthite said: “The two colleagues who had been trapped underground have been rescued and they are being attended to.”
