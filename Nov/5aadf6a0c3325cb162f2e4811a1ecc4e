                                         JOHANNESBURG - Six people arrested for public violence at the Bronkhorspruit magistrates court are expected to appear in court soon.  There were chaotic scenes at the court on Tuesday as community members clashed with police after two farmers accused of assaulting and shooting a nine-year-old girl were released on bail. It is understood that the girl and her friends followed a stray dog onto the farm when the alleged incident happened.  The farmers have been charged with kidnapping and attempted murder among other crimes for the September incident. The police's Mavela Masondo says officers had to fire rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse the crowd. “The violence broke out after an appearance of two suspects accused of an attempted murder and as the police, we had to intervene as the protesters were becoming violent.”
