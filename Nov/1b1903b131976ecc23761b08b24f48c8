Eleven people were shot dead in one night in the Marikana Informal Settlement in September. Mbalula has on Wednesday called a media briefing to announce four people have been positively linked to the mass assassination. Mbalula says investigators are still searching for a fifth suspect. He says the men are all residents of the Marikana Informal Settlement. “We’ve linked them to the killing of the people, one is still at large, and we expect to catch him soon.” The minister has revealed they were apprehended in various areas in connection with other crimes. However, Mbalula has confirmed they have been positively linked to the mass shooting on 29 of September through evidence and witness statements. The four men arrested are expected to appear in court on Thursday.  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
