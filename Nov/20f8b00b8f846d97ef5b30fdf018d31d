                                         JOHANNESBURG - MTN has confirmed that it is experiencing data problems in parts of the country after part of an overnight upgrade was not effective. Network users have reported bad signal and data problems since early on Thursday morning. MTN has now confirmed that the problem is specifically affecting users' data, which can't be accessed. MTN spokesperson Jacqui O'Sullivan has apologized to users and says they are hopeful the problem will be resolved in the next hour and a half. "The Randburg node may be having some impact on traffic in other areas of the network. It is a data problem, voice is not affected whatsoever and we do anticipate that the problem will be solved by about 9.30am this morning." Users, meanwhile, say that its been a frustrating morning. "MTN has been down since about 6am this morning, no bars," said one user. "This morning I had no data. I tried calling MTN and kept telling me I was not registered on the network and that happened for about half an hour. They can't give us a turnaround time, they admit there's a problem," another user said.
