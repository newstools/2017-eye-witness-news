                                         JOHANNESBURG - Tshwane emergency services say it suspects the gas cylinder which was found exploded in the wreckage of a Mamelodi shack may have fueled the blaze which claimed the lives of five family members. All the victims aged between one and 35 were burnt beyond recognition, when a fire swept through their shack at the Lusaka informal settlement in the early hours of yesterday. The cause of the fire is being investigated and police have opened an inquest into the deaths. Emergency services say the victims were asleep during the incident. The department's Johan Pieterse said, “They were burnt beyond recognition and normally that would be because of a gas cylinder explosion with lots of heat.”
