                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police are investigating whether cash-in-transit heists in Pretoria and the Hartbeespoort Dam area, which happened a few minutes apart, are related. In both incidents, criminals travelling in vehicles pushed cash vans off the road on Tuesday and used explosives to gain access to money. The North West police's Mpeile Talane says that they are working with Gauteng officers to determine if the same gang was responsible for both heists. “We need to work with other stations near us over these heists.” Talane says that it is believed that shortly after the successful heist in the Hartbeespoort Dam area, the criminals made their way to Pretoria. Three North West security guards were wounded when gunmen opened fire on their van, with the robbers making off with cash. Police say there was also foiled heist in the Kagiso industrial area on Tuesday. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
