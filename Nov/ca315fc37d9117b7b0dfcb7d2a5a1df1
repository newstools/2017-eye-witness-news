                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has reiterated its call to the provincial African National Congress (ANC) to strip Simon Mofokeng of his mayorship at the Emfuleni Municipality. The official opposition will on Tuesday to march to the municipal offices in the Vaal, calling on the ANC’s integrity committee to sack Mofokeng. Mofokeng is currently on special leave, pending an investigation, after he allegedly sexually assaulted and groomed a 14-year-old girl. The DA’s John Moodley says that this shows that little is done to officials involved in controversies. “When senior ANC members are involved in controversial matters, it’s somehow swept under the carpet. They are never held to account and next it surfaces somewhere else. We believe he must be removed as mayor.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
