                                         CAPE TOWN - As the globe marks World Prematurity Day, a first-time mother says her wish is to spend Christmas with her premature baby at home. Kala Ndango’s son was born at just 27 weeks at Groote Schuur Hospital on 7 October. She was one of several mothers who attended the launch of an initiative called “Mom's Milk on the Move”, which sees scooters transporting breastmilk from mothers to their newborns in hospital. Weighing just over one kilogramme, baby Jesse-Joshua Ndango, sleeps on his mother's chest as she speaks to Eyewitness News over the constant hiss of an oxygen pipe, one of many he's connected to. Ndango sits in a chair next to an empty incubator with a blanket wrapped around her chest. The only clue she's practising kangaroo care is the sight of the boy's bright purple knitted cap sticking out. The 34-year-old spends R40 on public transport to travel from Parow to Groote Schuur Hospital to visit her baby for nine hours a day, seven days a week. She says it's a terrible feeling leaving hospital without her baby. “It is a very difficult thing. When I go home, I can’t sleep. It’s like I hear my baby crying. Every day I need to rush to get to the hospital. When I see my baby, I thank God that he’s alive for another day.” Ndango has also undergone and passed tests to be a breastmilk donor to help other moms who are struggling to express milk.
