                                         HARARE - Robert Mugabe’s priest says that the former president has no hard feelings about stepping down and did it for the good of the country. The astonishing claims were made in an interview with state media in Zimbabwe.  Fidelis Mukonori’s account of how Robert Mugabe's face glowed with happiness after agreeing to resign will be viewed with some scepticism in Zimbabwe. But the Catholic priest's account of what happened while Mugabe was under house arrest at his Blue Roof mansion does contain some interesting details. He says that during the days leading up to Mugabe's resignation, he worked up to 16 hours in every 24. He was shuffling between Mugabe and the generals who'd taken control and then eventually the two sides met. Mukonori's claims that Mugabe wished the new president well are sharply at odds with other press accounts which say Mugabe was upset, defiant and confused during the time he was under arrest.
