                                         JOHANNESBURG - Despite the African National Congress (ANC) distancing itself from a consultative conference organised by its own stalwarts, several of the party's NEC members are in attendance, including former president Thabo Mbeki. The gathering, which is taking place in Braamfontein, is also attended by civil society organizations, business and ANC-led alliance partners. ANC stalwart Wally Serote says there is a valid reason why they decided to hold this conference. He says by the end of this conference, there should be a clear answer to one burning question. “How has it happened that the ANC has not been able to save the honour of the people of this country?” Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and former Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom are among those attending.
