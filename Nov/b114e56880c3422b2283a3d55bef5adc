A fire in Gordon’s Bay destroyed or damaged five homes while a second fire started overnight in Red Hill in the South Peninsula. CAPE TOWN - Western Cape firefighters are making progress on two fires that have been raging out of control. The first fire is in Gordon’s Bay. It destroyed or damaged five homes. The second started overnight in Red Hill in the South Peninsula. Firefighters have managed to contain that blaze. The higher up one drives along Red Hill Road toward Cape Point the cooler and stronger the winds become and the thicker the smoke becomes. Still, the strength is nothing compared to the fierce winds in Gordon’s Bay on Wednesday morning. Ground teams can be seen beating some flames close to a house on a farm, but the largest section of the fire in the area, which includes South African navy property, has been contained. More than a dozen firefighters can be seen battling the flames in the Scarborough nature reserve. Parts of Gordon's Bay are still without power after the fire damaged two sub-stations. The city's Charlotte Powell said: “The City of Cape Town electricity services together with Eskom are working to restore power. At this stage, no restoration time is available.”
