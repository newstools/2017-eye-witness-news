                                         CAPE TOWN - The Cape Winelands District Municipality says it has additional firefighting resources ahead of the fire season. The municipality on Friday launched its veldfire readiness campaign which sees 60 seasonal firefighters join forces with permanent staff over the next few months. The Municipality’s Fire Services’ Wayne Josias says they attended to more than 1,500 fires last year. “There was a handover of specific vehicle geared for our veldfire fighting operations. It’s a major 4x4 firefighting pumper, driving on a 380-horsepower motor, which will be a great assistance during the fire season.”  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
