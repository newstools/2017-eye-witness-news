                                         JOHANNESBURG - A woman whose sister is one of the victims of the Esidimeni crisis says she was diagnosed with a heart condition after her sister's death, saying she suffers from guilt when eating knowing that her sibling died of hunger. Anna Mthembu has been testifying at the arbitration hearings in Parktown on Thursday afternoon. Her sister Busisiwe died at the Cullinan Care Rehab Centre in Pretoria last July, just 32 days after she was taken there from Esidimeni. One hundred and forty-one mentally ill people lost their lives after being moved to unlicensed NGOs, after the Gauteng Health Department terminated its contract with the Life Esidimeni group, allegedly to save costs. Mthembu says she goes through a lot of guilt because her mother left Busisiwe in her care and she took her to Esidimeni. She started to cry as she told the hearing that she thinks of her sister starving. “Even when I arrived at home I continued crying and saying to myself that I had food but it looks like my sister didn’t have food.” Mthembu’s interpreter had to be escorted out as she also started to cry. #LifeEsidemeni even the interpreter starts to cry, and asks that her colleague takes over.
