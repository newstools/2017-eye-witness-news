                                         JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says his legal team is putting together a solid case against the Department of Home Affairs for not fulfilling its constitutional obligation to provide every resident in the country with the correct identity documentation.  The mayor says the city continues to deal with thousands of undocumented foreign nationals. This week the mayor signed a settlement agreement with the African Diaspora Forum concerning remarks he's made about foreign nationals in the past.  Mashaba says he's happy about his partnership with the forum.  He says his legal team is putting together papers to serve the Home Affairs Department. “Using Advocate Dali Mpofu and Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, they are busy preparing documents which will be served against home affairs.” Mashaba says this is not just a housing challenge. “Including providing services in clinics and other spheres of government.” The mayor says having undocumented residents makes planning and budgeting immensely difficult.
