                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Finance MEC Barbara Creecy has freed up an extra R4 billion for the provincial budget.  Creecy is delivering her medium-term budget policy statement in the legislature on Thursday. She's given a breakdown of how the Gauteng government will use funds for the remainder of the financial year. The budget allocation brings the total to R12 billion. Most of the R4 billion increase has been afforded to the health and education departments. “Because we do regard the current financial state of the Health Department as a major risk to the public purse, we have allocated R1.23 billion in the adjustment to assist with spending pressures on goods and services and also personnel.” Infrastructure, as well as roads and transport, have also been given large portions, with both recording an increase of over R200 million and R100 million, respectively. Following closely behind is the controversial eGovernment system, which has received an additional R100 million. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
