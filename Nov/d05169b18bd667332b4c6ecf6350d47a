                                         CAPE TOWN - An eight-year-old child has died in a fire in Bonteheuwel. At least two wendy houses were destroyed and a house damaged in Thursday night’s blaze. The cause of the fire is unknown. Bonteheuwel ward councillor Angus McKenzie was on scene last night. “Late last night, residents were devastated not only by the fire that engulfed two backyard dwellings and a home, but also by the fact that an eight-year-old child had sadly passed away due to smoke inhalation.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
