                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng police commissioner Deliwe de Lange has urged the public not to give criminals an opportunity to target them by being reckless with their belongings and personal information. The province launched its 2017 safer festive season operations at the Mall of the South in Johannesburg on Friday. The province has deployed 1,200 trainee constables at malls and shopping centres for the upcoming festive season. De Lange says she’d confident in the province’s readiness to fight crime as a number of stakeholders including security companies have been brought on board. “With this launch, we also aim to remind the public that in the same manner that the police have adopted a back-to-basics approach in the way in which we conduct policing, the public too needs to go back to basics in terms of prioritising their personal safety and security.” She has, however, urged the public to be cautious when using cash and ATMs during this period. The commissioner says the province has identified hotspots which are mostly malls and shopping centres where new constables will be deployed.
