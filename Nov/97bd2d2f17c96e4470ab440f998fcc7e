If necessary he will need to be disGraced. pic.twitter.com/xHSohDYKbF  There are questions and doubts about whether Mugabe will finally relinquish power or remain defiant. Zimbabwe's war veterans say they will initiate court action to legalise the military action against the president after the army seized power last week. The group's leader Christopher Mutsvangwa has called on Mugabe to leave state house. “Please leave state house and let the country start on a new page. You should have the dignity and decency to spare the country further turmoil by simply announcing your departure immediately.” He says they are prepared to mobilise people to take to the streets should Mugabe not resign. “We are bringing back the people of Zimbabwe to the streets. He will then have to settle his issues with the people of Zimbabwe, once more.”
