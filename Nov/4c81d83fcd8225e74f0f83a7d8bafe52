                                         JOHANNESBURG - The world's eyes are firmly fixed on Zimbabwe, with questions and doubts about whether President Robert Mugabe will finally relinquish power or remain defiant. The 93-year-old defied expectations that he would resign in a national address on Sunday night, during which he was flanked by military generals. Hours earlier, Zanu-PF had removed him as head of the party, while axed vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa was reinstated. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's war veterans say they will initiate court action to legalise the military action against the president after the army seized power last week. The group's leader Christopher Mutsvangwa says they will argue in court that the military takeover was legal because Mugabe was derelict in his duties. Mutsvangwa says Mugabe should go now. “We saw him go to the national television to pretend as if everything is normal and he was saying that he will attend his party congress. We are saying ‘Mugabe go now, go now, Mugabe go now, go now, your time is up’.” The midday deadline for Mugabe’s resignation, set by his party on Sunday has now come and gone. Now Zimbabweans and the world wait to see how the country will dig itself out of this deepening political crisis. As speculation of Mugabe's next move grows, it’s being reported that the 93-year-old has drafted his resignation letter and has agreed to step down. Under the terms of Mugabe's reported deal, he and his wife, grace would be granted full immunity but details of their departure are not yet known. But Zanu-PF spokesperson Khaya Moyo says he's not aware of the letter and the apparent arrangements.
