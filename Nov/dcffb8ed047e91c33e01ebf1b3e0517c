Zuma was speaking during the launch of the third Invest One Stop Shop in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. The president took time during his speech to reflect on the political impasse in Zimbabwe, saying that a stable sister country is crucial for all living in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The country remains on tenterhooks as thousands march through the streets of Harare calling on President Robert Mugabe to step down. Zuma says that he expects all SADC member states to affirm African Union (AU) directives regarding changes in government. "We also reaffirm the African Union directive against unconstitutional changes of government within the continent, which all SADC member states should abide by." #InvestSAKZN Zuma on #Zimbabwe : "We also re-affirm the AU directive against unconstitutional changes in govt. within the continent."
