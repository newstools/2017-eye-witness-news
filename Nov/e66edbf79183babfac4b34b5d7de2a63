CAPE TOWN – Twitter has officially increased its character limit from 140 to 280. As you might guess, Twitter users have lots to say about this. In September, Twitter launched a test that expanded the 140-character limit so that every person around the world could express themselves 'easily' in a Tweet, according to its blog. Some people embraced this, but others say Twitter has “lost its soul”. The struggle is real for some users.  #280characters got people wanting to write essays on twitter but truth is, tweets are fun when kept nice and short....     Others users are loving the 280-character limit.    It didn't take long for US President Donald Trump to join the essay-tweeting community.   There is some good news for those who hate it. Twitter found that users’ behaviour returned to “normal” after a while. “During the first few days of the test many people Tweeted the full 280 limit because it was new and novel, but soon after behavior normalized (more on this below). We saw when people needed to use more than 140 characters, they Tweeted more easily and more often. But importantly, people Tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter remained.”   The feature has been rolled out in most languages. Twitter says Japanese, Korean and Chinese will continue to have 140 characters because cramming is not an issue in these languages.
