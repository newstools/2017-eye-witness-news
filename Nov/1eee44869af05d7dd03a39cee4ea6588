                                         CAPE TOWN - Teaching is often regarded as a thankless job, but the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) has honoured the province's educators at the annual top teacher’s award ceremony. Premier Helen Zille and her husband Professor Johann Maree were among the guests at the awards on Friday. Education MEC Debbie Schäfer says that the WCED puts great emphasis on acknowledging excellence and recognising teachers who inspire and motivate children every day. She has also applauded schools that are running new and innovative programmes after partnering with NGO's and private organisations to improve teaching and learning at your school. The department adopted the "Year of the Teacher" as a key theme for 2017. It has identified six core values that drives its approach to public service. These are: caring, competence, accountability, integrity, innovation and responsiveness. 2/3 Wonderful WCED NTA function 3 Nov 2017: Our Provincial winners @DebbieSchafer @jessicashelver @DoveWarda @WCEDnews honoring our teachers pic.twitter.com/PGKwzOYzXi  3/3 Wonderful WCED NTA function 3 Nov 2017: Our Provincial winners @DebbieSchafer @jessicashelver @DoveWarda @WCEDnews honoring our teachers pic.twitter.com/S5Iog2UvYf  1/2 WCED NTA 2017: Leadership Excellence in After School Program: Gold Winner: Mr Roy van Rooyen  @DebbieSchafer @PennyTainton @WCEDnews pic.twitter.com/oAk9yisXJp  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
