                                         JOHANNESBURG - A strike is looming in the coal sector over wages. The National Union of Mines (NUM) says that it is mobilising its members to embark on a mass demonstration in the coal sector after negotiations reached a deadlock on Wednesday. Workers are demanding a R1,100 once-off amount this year and an 8% increase for 2018. They've also accused the Chamber of Mines of exploiting mine workers and showing complete arrogance during negotiations.  The union says it will announce a date for a strike soon. “They have a mentality of wanting to exploit black mine workers, knowing that black mine workers in this country are still being paid poverty wages.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
