                                         CAPE TOWN - The city lawman arrested for the possession of 41,000 mandrax tablets has resigned. Clinton Langeveldt was arrested last week while he was off duty and has been remanded in custody after his first court appearance. The City of Cape Town had immediately started proceedings to suspend him. The City of Cape Town's mayoral committee member for Safety and Security JP Smith has confirmed the arrested law enforcement officer will not return to work. Smith says he still faces criminal prosecution. Besides allegedly possessing drugs worth R2 million, Langeveldt was also carrying his service pistol at the time of his arrest, which is in breach of protocol. It has also emerged Langeveldt was nominated for an outstanding service award last year, for saving the life of a car crash victim who had a heart attack. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
