                                         JOHANNESBURG - Uhuru Kenyatta will be sworn in for a second term as Kenya’s president on Tuesday, marking the final act of an electoral saga that exposed deep and lasting divisions in the country. His inauguration is due to take place a week after Kenya’s Supreme Court validated his poll victory, although the country's political crisis is not over. Protests sparked by the court decision left two dead; they're the latest casualties in a four-month period of unrest in which 56 people have died. Rights groups say most victims were killed at the hands of police.
