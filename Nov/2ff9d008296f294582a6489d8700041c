                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress's motions of no confidence against Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and Speaker Vasco da Gama have failed. One-hundred-and-forty members voted against the motion while 121 voted in support of it on Thursday evening. On Wednesday, the ANC failed to get the motion on the agenda, with the council meeting dealing with other municipal issues first. The ANC wanted Mashaba removed, claiming that under his leadership Johannesburg residents are receiving poor service delivery.
