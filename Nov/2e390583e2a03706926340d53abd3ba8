                                         CAPE TOWN - The trial of triple murder accused Henri van Breda could wrap up this week. Van Breda's defence team will be playing its final cards in trying to bolster its arguments. His lawyers will submit reports from a neurologist and a psychologist, both of whom are likely to be called as defence witnesses. The last time the accused was in court, Judge Siraj Desai told his lawyer, advocate Pieter Botha, that the case has been dragging on unnecessarily long. Botha told the court he could finish the questioning of his final two witnesses in one day. He's expected to call up neurologist James Butler, whose report will impact the next witness, psychologist Elspeth Burke's report. Butler diagnosed Van Breda as having a condition called juvenile myoclonic epilepsy after the 23-year-old had a seizure two weeks ago.  The defence is likely to use this to explain Van Breda's claim that he blacked out for about two hours and 45 minutes on the night of the attacks. Burke will be testifying on the accusedâ€™s actions and behaviour during and after the incident, after the State and court questioned why he didn't try to stop the attacks on his family.
