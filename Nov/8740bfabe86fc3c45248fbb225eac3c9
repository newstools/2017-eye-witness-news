                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma says it would be “irrational and unconstitutional” for him to suspend National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams based on a recent Supreme Court of Appeal judgment. The appeal court last month dismissed Zuma and the NPA’s challenge to the High Court judgment that declared invalid the decision to drop fraud, corruption and racketeering charges against the president. Its judgment was also scathing in its criticism of the prosecuting authority. Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota asked whether the president intended taking action against Abrahams after the Supreme Court of Appeal criticised the way the NPA head sought to justify the 2009 decision to drop the charges against him. In his written response, Zuma says it would be irrational and unconstitutional of him to suspend Abrahams based on the judgment – and that nothing in it suggests Abrahams is not a fit and proper person to be the national director of Public Prosecutions. The NPA last month gave Zuma until the end of 30 November to make representations as to why the charges should not be reinstated. In reply to a question from Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane, Zuma says the matter’s with the NPA and that he is taking legal advice. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
