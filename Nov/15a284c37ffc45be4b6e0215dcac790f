                                         CAPE TOWN - Eight members of the #UniteBehind movement were arrested on charges of trespassing.  On Wednesday, a small group marched through the streets of Cape Town and called on South Africans to call for President Jacob Zuma’s arrest.  Later during the day, their members held a sit-in at the Western Cape headquarters of the National Prosecuting Authority. Bruce Baigrie, one of the organisers, says that it is time for the NPA to take action against Zuma. “Their demand is that we at least see a warrant for Zuma’s arrest. We understand that he isn’t in Cape Town so he can’t be arrested right now, but they at least want to see the warrant for his arrest.”   In a Facebook post, the group says they had no choice but to take action following recent claims of Zuma being “bankrolled” by Roy Moodley and his “corrupt front companies”. “Moodley's corrupt dealings in the Siyangena contract, a contract meant to improve the security crisis at Metrorail, has directly cost lives. When we say #ArrestZuma we mean arrest the president and his keepers. When we say #ArrestUs, we mean that we will submit to arrest.” The group adds NPA head Shaun Abrahams and the Hawks have made a complete mockery of the constitutional duty to “prosecute without fear, favour and prejudice”. “Weeks have passed since the Supreme Court of Appeal ordered the reinstatement of charges related to the arms deal, yet Zuma has not been arrested.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
