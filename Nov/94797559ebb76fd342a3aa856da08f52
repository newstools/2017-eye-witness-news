                                         JOHANNESBURG - South Africa has lost 2-0 to Senegal, ending their hopes of qualifying for Russia 2018 World Cup. Bafana Bafana needed nothing but a win to keep their hopes of qualifying for Russia 2018 alive, but first-half goal by Diafra Sakho and an own goal from Thamsanqa Mkhize dashed all hopes. Bafana were not tame in their attempts to score goals with countless creative build-ups, but their finishing was far from impressive. Lebogang Manyama, Percy Tau, Themba Zwane and Sibusiso Vilakazi failed to put the finishing touches to their lovely interplays. It took few touches from the Lions of Teranga to tear through the Bafana defence, with Sadio Mane slicing through the defence with a killer pass to set up Sakho, and then Sakho put Mane through for the Liverpool attacker to force the own goal. The win sends Senegal through to their first world cup since Korea and Japan in 2002, while the South Africans fail to qualify for another tournament, with their last appearance being in 2010 when the country hosted.
