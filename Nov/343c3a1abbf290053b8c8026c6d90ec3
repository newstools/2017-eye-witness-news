                                         CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says that education in the province needs more money. They were reacting to the provincial medium term budget policy statement delivered on Thursday by Finance MEC Ivan Meyer.  Education is one of the provincial strategic goals and more than R20 million was allocated for it for the 2017/2018 financial year.  Some of that money will be used to implement programmes in poor areas and expand on existing school safety projects.  But the ANC’s Theo Olivier believes the provincial government isn’t doing enough. “Firstly I think the crime at schools is a key risk. If you look at the daily reports on how the learners are being stabbed at school.” The ANC in the province wants more funds freed up to pour resources into areas where gangs operate, ensuring better security and a proper learning environment.
