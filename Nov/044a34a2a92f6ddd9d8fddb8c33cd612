                                            South African Sevens star Ruhan Nel is eager to continue his title winning ways, when the HSBC World Sevens Series kicks off in Dubai on Friday.
                                         JOHANNESBURG- Blitzbok Sevens star Ruhan Nel is hungry for more titles this season, as the HSBC World Sevens Series gets underway in Dubai on Friday. Nel and the Blitzboks are the reigning World Sevens Series champions, after a dominant campaign last season, which saw them win five of the eight finals that they competed in. The utility back Nel didn’t rest on his laurels of winning the World Series title, and went straight into the blue and white hoops of Western Province in the SuperSport Challenge, where again he lifted a trophy for the second time in the season.  Nel also raised the prestigious Currie Cup title with Western Province to complete a hat trick of titles in the season, but Nel’s hunger for more silverware is far from satisfied.  “We got the World Series, Commonwealth Games and the World Cup this season, so there’s no better motivation to win more trophies than that. We are World Series and Commonwealth Games defending champions, and we would definitely love to win the World Cup.”  Nel also reflected on the titles he won last season.  “To be part of the five finals we won and eventually the World Series title was special, and winning the Currie Cup was also a great highlight, not many people get to win the Currie Cup so it was special for me.”  The Blitzboks are currently in Dubai preparing for the opening leg of the World Sevens Series starting on Friday 1st of December.
