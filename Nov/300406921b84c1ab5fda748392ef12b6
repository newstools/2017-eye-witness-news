                                         CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town is urging residents to adhere to calls to discharge fireworks at sites that have been designated for Guy Fawkes celebrations. Many residents participate in the Guy Fawkes Day’s festivities each year on 5 November each year. The city's JP Smith says they're expecting an increase in the number of complaints related to these celebrations. “We implore the public to please be sensible about the use of Guy Fawkes and to respect the rights of others who do not share the enthusiasm for the tradition. We also appeal to pet owners to keep their animals in doors and as far as possible.”
