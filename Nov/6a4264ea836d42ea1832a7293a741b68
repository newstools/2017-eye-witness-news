                                         JOHANNESBURG - South African Tennis star Kevin Anderson has parted ways with coach Neville Godwin on Tuesday, after four years. Under Godwin’s tutelage, Anderson reached a world high ranking of 10th in 2015, and also reached five ATP finals. Anderson also reached his career best finish in a Grand Slam when he was a losing finalist at this year’s US Open.  Anderson went on to achieve the quarterfinals of the US Open (2015) and seven fourth-round Grand Slam berths being the Australian Open (2014/2015), French Open (2014/2017), Wimbledon (2014/2017) and US Open (2015). Anderson says that he remains friends with Godwin.  “After four years, coach Neville Godwin and I have decided to part ways. We remain great friends and it was simply a case of both of us looking for fresh challenges. We have hit great heights together, such as a top 10 ranking and a Grand Slam final, and I will be forever grateful. I wish Neville the best of luck and hope he wins ATP coach of the year as it would be much deserved.” Godwin has been nominated alongside Ivan Ljubicic (Roger Federer), Martin Laurendeau (Denis Shapovalov), Toni Nadal & Carlos Moya (Rafael Nadal) and Alexander Zverev Sr. (Alexander Zverev & Mischa Zverev) for the 2017 ATP coach of the year award.
