                                         CAPE TOWN - Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe has hit back against any suggestion by Members of Parliament (MPs) that he resigned from Eskom, insisting that he'd taken early retirement. His departure from Eskom and his brief return earlier this year have come into sharp focus during the parliamentary inquiry into Eskom on Tuesday night. Molefe left the parastatal after former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela revealed his close relationship to the Guptas in her State of Capture report. The report claims that he called Ajay Gupta 44 times and visited Saxonwold, where the family resides, several times. Molefe spent several hours in the hot seat answering questions about his tenure at Eskom. He pushed back against any suggestion that he had resigned. “Minister Brown says her recollection is that I said I resigned, and I disputed that in the court papers.” He says former board chairperson Ben Ngubane asked him to return in May because Eskom had made a "common error" by granting him early retirement. Molefe's reappointment was rescinded at the behest of Minister Lynne Brown. Molefe's R30 million pension package is the subject of litigation.
