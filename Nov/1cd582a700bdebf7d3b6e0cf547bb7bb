                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's decision to announce his slate in public is unacceptable. At a campaign rally in Limpopo at the weekend, Ramaphosa called on ANC members to elect Naledi Pandor as deputy president and Gwede Mantashe as chairperson. He also mentioned other possible candidates, including Paul Mashatile and Senzo Mchunu. However, the ANC says that party leaders should not make such pronouncements as this tampers with branch nominations. Ramaphosa has since defended his comments, saying that the names mentioned stemmed from interactions and nominations from ANC structures. The ANC has called the move unacceptable, adding that it undermines the party’s branches. The presidential hopeful announced what he referred to as his "winning team" will be going into the December elective conference. “I’m saying let’s support comrade Naledi Pandor to be the next deputy president of the ANC and Gwede Mantashe to be our national chairperson.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
