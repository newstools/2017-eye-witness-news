                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African Diaspora Forum has described the military takeover in Zimbabwe as the end of a nightmare and echoed the Economic Freedom Fighters' (EFF) call for President Robert Mugabe  and his family to be granted political asylum in South Africa.  The situation unfolding in Zimbabwe has been described as a "silent coup" by political analysts, while the military says it’s not an attempt to topple Mugabe's government. President Jacob Zuma in his capacity as South African Development Community (SADC) chair on Wednesday contacted Mugabe who is confined to his house, confirming his safety.  SADC leaders will meet in Botswana on Thursday afternoon, while South African envoys will hold separate discussions in Harare. The EFF on Wednesday said it was in the interest of a peaceful transition in Zimbabwe for Zuma to grant Mugabe asylum. The African Diaspora's Marc Gbaffou agrees and has welcome the latest developments in Harare. WATCH: Zimbabwe tense after military takeover
