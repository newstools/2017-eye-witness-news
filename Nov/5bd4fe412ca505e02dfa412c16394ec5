                                         JOHANNESBURG - Two miners have been killed and two others remain trapped underground at AngloGold Ashanti's Mponeng Mine in Carletonville. Rescue operations are underway to try and reach the trapped mine workers. The mine's Chris Nthite says a seismic event led to the rock collapse. “At this stage, rescue teams are still working through the rock fall so that they can locate our employees. We will work around the clock until we find them.” Managers at the mine say they have not yet managed to communicate with two trapped miners at the world's deepest mine. Nthite said: “Search and rescue teams are working through challenging ground conditions to locate the two employees who remain trapped. Their condition is unknown at this stage and we would like to express our sincere condolences to the families of our departed colleagues.” This is third such incident at the Mponeng Mine in just over a month, with two miners having lost their lives just two weeks ago.
