                                         JOHANNESBURG - It’s emerged the driver of a private undertaker contracted by the Gauteng Health Department to transport over 40 unidentified bodies does not have the correct documents. A trailer carrying the coffins from the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital to a cemetery in the south of Johannesburg broke down on the M1 south earlier on Wednesday.  Officials from the Health Department, Emergency Services and police were still on the scene.  The City of Johannesburg said the driver does not have the documents required to transport bodies. Luyanda Longwe has commented on behalf of the MMC for Public Safety. “When asked for the appropriate documents he was unable to provide them to the authorities.” Longwe says police have now taken over the investigation. “Our forensic team is in sight and that information has been handed over to them.” Traffic was still heavily backed up on the M1 south as the bodies were yet to be moved.  Meanwhile, Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopha says she’s concerned that an open trailer was used to transport bodies from a state hospital to a cemetery in the south of Joburg. Ramakgopha visited the scene on the M1 south where the trailer broke down. She said her department was investigating why the procedure was flouted. “We’ll investigate whether the driver has violated any conditions and specifications for transporting the bodies.” WATCH: 42 bodies stranded on M1 after trailer loses its wheel  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
