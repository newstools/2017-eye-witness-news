                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says there were several inconsistencies with former Eskom boss Brian Molefe's testimony at a parliamentary inquiry into state capture. Molefe told Members of Parliament (MPs) on Tuesday that former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela  was in a rush to finalise her report, which found that he was in close contact with the Gupta family during his tenure. Molefe was questioned about the report, his relationship with the controversial family and his R30 million pension payout. The DA's shadow minister for public enterprises Natasha Mazzone said: “He said one thing to me or to one of my colleagues and in the next answer a different one. And I asked him a very straightforward question. I said: 'Did you know that Eskom did work with Trillian?' and he said no.  "And then about 15 minutes later when one of my colleagues asked him about Trillian he said ‘well, you know we looked at the contract of Trillian. I wasn’t really sure if we should go forward with that kind of thing'.” WATCH: Zola Tsotsi appears before Parly committee on state capture
