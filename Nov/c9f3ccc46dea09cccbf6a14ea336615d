It says the overall debt by the affected municipalities amount to a total of R10.7 billion with other debts accrued from the previous financial years. The department has threatened to reduce the water supply in defaulting municipalities or cut off their supply completely until payments are made. Spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says they’ve exhausted all avenues to force the affected municipalities to settle their debts and this is the last resort. “They need to settle their current accounts within 30 or 60 days then we can make arrangements on the outstanding amount which has been building up over time. We are saying between now and December there needs to be other engagements, including engagements with National Treasury and Cogta.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
