                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has given its first reaction to Robert Mugabe' s resignation as Zimbabwe’s president, saying the 93-year-old former leader must be celebrated for his role over the last decade. The party made the remarks during a briefing at Luthuli House on Wednesday. ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe joked as he gave his first reaction to Mugabe’s resignation. “Zimbabwe… My president has resigned, he calls me Gwede Ma.” Mantashe says the party believes Mugabe must continue to be celebrated and respected. “We must continue respecting Mugabe for the role he played as a freedom fighter and we must continue supporting him in advocating the Africa’s Development Programme. We must celebrate him as a Pan Africanist and the role he played over the last decades.” He has called on Zimbabwean nationals living in South Africa to go back home and help rebuild Zimbabwe.
