                                         JOHANNESBURG - Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu has hit back at reports that her department’s splurged millions on official ministerial vehicles. She was asked by Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Toby Chance to justify her department spending what he claimed amounted to R3,1 million on just three vehicles. Zulu said Chance should have checked his facts first. “It would’ve been very important for you, Honourable Chance, to ask the journalist who wrote the story to give you the facts and not what he thinks.” Zulu denied her Lexus cost as much as was reported. “First and foremost I do drive a Lexus, which only costs R580,000, so let’s start from there. That car did not cost the millions that you’re talking about.” Zulu says she’s been in contact with the journalists who wrote the story. “Quite frankly, I find it to be very stupid for somebody who should know how much a Lexus costs... even a child would know that that model of a Lexus would never cost a million rand.”
