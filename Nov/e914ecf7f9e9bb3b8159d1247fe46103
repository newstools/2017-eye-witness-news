                                            Three of the ANC's presidential candidates - Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Lindiwe Sisulu & Zweli Mkhize - have withdrawn from The Gathering to be held in Sandton on 23 November 2017.
                                         JOHANNESBURG - One of this year's hottest political discussion events is less than a day away but there'll be three people who won't be gathering for, well, The Gathering on the the ANC's elective conference. Now, normally when three people don't pitch up for an event that draws a crowd of hundreds no one bats an eyelid, but in this instance, the trio happens to be Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Lindiwe Sisulu and Zweli Mkhize. Dlamini-Zuma, Sisulu and Mkhize all happen to be candidates in the race to succeed Jacob Zuma as the ANC's number 1. Teams for all three candidates confirmed their participation in writing several weeks ago. While both Eyewitness News and Daily Maverick are surprised and disappointed with the late withdrawal of the presidential hopefuls, the show will go on. A cracking line-up of thought leaders, journalists and politicians will keep the audience at the Sandton Convention Centre gripped and entertained. On the bill are: Pravin Gordhan, Makhosi Khoza, Julius Malema, Mmusi Maimane, Bantu Holomisa, Mzwanele Manyi, Zapiro, Mavuso Msimang, Jacques Pauw and Tendai Biti.
