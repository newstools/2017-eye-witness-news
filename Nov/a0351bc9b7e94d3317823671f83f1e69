                                         PRETORIA - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says there is a need to reinforce watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) to deal with corruption within the SA Police Service (SAPS). Mbalula says he is relooking policies that would support independent structures to do their work effectively. He was addressing the media at the SAPS Tshwane academy. Mbalula says the 6 Component Act bodies within his ministry, which include the Hawks and Ipid, are considering operational plans to combat crime. In his meeting at the SAPS Tshwane Academy, MECs and other stakeholders are presenting plans to guide the components into the legislative framework. “We consider operational plans in relation to different campaigns, reports that we’ve received and we’re, obviously, appraising ourselves of such and how do we need to respond to that, effectively.” The Min-MEC meeting takes place against the backdrop of the release of the crimes statistics, in which Mbalula says there would be scrutiny and appraisals. Mbalula says there is also a need to effectively coordinate and strengthen management within the saps amid the service functioning without a permanent commissioner.
