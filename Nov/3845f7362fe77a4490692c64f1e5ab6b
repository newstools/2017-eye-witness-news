                                         JOHANNESBURG - There have been many forms of protest against the Gupta family and their companies implicated in state capture and dodgy deals, from protests and online petitions to graphic paintings. But one man has taken giving the proverbial finger to the Guptas to a whole new level. Equities trader and hedge fund manager James Gubb executed a series of trades in Gupta-owned Oakbay shares which when plotted visually give the controversial family the middle finger. 
                                                                  But the Financial Services Board was not amused and fined Gubb R100,000. "I got fined R100,000 yesterday by the FSB for trading 22 shares at various prices on the now delisted Oakbay, the Gupta Family’s financial vehicle, at the end of March this year, around the days of protest around the country. This was recommended by the JSE after an interrogation on 18 May in Cape Town by the JSE," Gubb said in a statement issued on 2 November. "What I have done is essentially a world first, ie used a financial information medium to create a recognisable image. Conceptual art, Protest Art, Indelible Graffiti, whatever you want to call it, I gave it a go to highlight the ongoing systematic rape of our country by the Gupta family. The fact that the image was that of a clenched fist with the middle finger extended might have offended some, but that was the point. We were asked by Pravin Gordhan to “by all means possible, stand fast in the face of brazen, blatant corruption” which I did in my own way. I literally joined the dots." Many South Africans, however, loved Gubb's innovative form of protest.
