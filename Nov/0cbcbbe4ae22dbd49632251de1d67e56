                                         JOHANNESBURG - West Ham United has confirmed the sacking of manager Slaven Bilic from the London club on Monday following Saturday’s 4-1 home defeat to Liverpool. Bilic (49) joined the Hammers in 2015 and guided them to a seventh-place finish in his first season in charge at Upton Park. West Ham has since relocated to the London Stadium but it hasn’t brought about any good fortune for both club and manager, as they finished the 2016/17 season in eleventh place. The former Croatia defender has been under pressure this season after a poor start, which has seen them register defeats in their first three league games, and have only won two in 2017 so far. Former Everton and Manchester United Manager, David Moyes, is tipped to be Bilic’s replacement at the London Stadium. West Ham currently occupies the eighteenth spot on the league table and next take on Watford on Sunday 19 November.
