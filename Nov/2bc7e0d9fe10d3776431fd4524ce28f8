                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte says the party is taking every precaution to ensure that the December elective conference goes ahead smoothly despite threats of disruptions and interdicts. Concerns have been raised about certain factions which may try to stop next month’s conference from taking place, but Duarte says they will not succeed. Earlier this month, former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel also expressed doubts about whether the event would go ahead.  She says the party is in touch with members in different provinces and branches and they are committed to a smooth election process. “We have been fairly strict about processes this time around. We’ve made all the relevant registrations possibilities available to us to ensure that every person who comes to conference is indeed a delegate that was elected in a branch and not imposters.” At the same time, outgoing ANC president Jacob Zuma hosted a working dinner on Thursday night with the ANC members who have made themselves available for nomination as president of the party.  From the meeting, the seven ANC leaders committed themselves to promote unity and comradeship in the preparations for, during and after the national conference. Zuma met with deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, national chairperson Baleka Mbete, treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, NEC members Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Lindiwe Sisulu and Jeff Radebe, as well as former treasurer-general Matthews Phosa.
