                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has again called on party leaders and presidential hopefuls not to make pronouncements on preferred slates following Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's announcement of his preferred team.  At a campaign rally in Limpopo over the weekend, Ramaphosa called on ANC party members to elect Naledi Pandor as his deputy at the December elective conference. While Ramaphosa included Gwede Mantashe as his preference for the role of the party's chair; Mantashe has said in a statement that such pronouncements are unacceptable and taint the elective process while undermining the branches. He says leaders should not taint the elective process but respect branches in making their own choices. In response, Ramaphosa says he welcomes the criticism and opposing views.  Ramaphosa says the names he mentioned for leadership positions stem from interactions with ANC structures and believes this does not detract from the role of the branches. The presidential hopeful announced what he referred to as his winning team going into the December elective conference. “I’m saying let’s support comrade Naledi Pandor to be the next deputy president of the ANC and Gwede Mantashe to be our national chairperson.”
