                                         CAPE TOWN - Three Mfuleni men are expected in court this week after they were nabbed with abalone worth R1 million. Police nabbed the trio during patrols in the area earlier this week. Officers stopped a vehicle in Eerste River Road and upon searching it, found more than 5,000 bags of perlemoen. The police's Noloyiso Rwexana says that the bakkie that the suspects were travelling in was reported as hijacked in Kleinvlei earlier this month. “The members who were patrolling noticed a vehicle and stopped it. Preliminary investigations revealed the Toyota Hilux had been hijacked in Kleinvlei during this month.”  Two men were also apprehended in Caledon last week for the possession of R5 million worth of perlemoen.
