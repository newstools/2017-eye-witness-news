                                         CAPE TOWN - A group of traffic officers had an unexpected surprise on Friday morning. They responded to a call of a car stopped on the N2 incoming on Jakes Gerwel Drive. 
                                                                  They thought they were just going to assist, but when they arrived, they found a woman in the car in the advanced stages of labour. But it is traffic officer Amanda Fojo, who is also a first aider and a midwife, who has been hailed as a hero after safely delivering the baby. She was issuing a fine to a taxi driver during the morning's peak traffic when a motorist stopped to ask for help in getting a pregnant woman to hospital. Fojo says that from experience, she could tell the mom didn't have much time. “As I looked at the lady she said she was in labour and started at 3am. I could determine that she was going to give birth at anytime.” [LISTEN] Senior traffic officer Amanda Fojo chats about delivering baby during traffic  With no time to call an ambulance, she rolled-up her sleeves. It's a baby boy. The mom and her son are doing well, and our traffic services just became god parents! "It's a beautiful, healthy baby boy," Fojo adds. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
