                                         JOHANNESBURG - Major retailers have given positive feedback on Black Friday sales with some companies predicting major turnover records by close of business on Friday. South Africans made their way to shopping centres and malls to try to take advantage of major discounts on food clothing and appliances. Makro's Andrew Stein says they are pleased to have been able to keep up with the demand. “I mean these are the same we expected to see this year and typically people save up on Black Friday TVs and appliances. We prepared accordingly and we’re very pleased that we planned appropriately.” Shoprite's Neil Schreuder Says their decision to offer sales at more stores has paid off. “We’ve opened it up to all of our Shoprite stores this year as well, not only Checkers. So, it adds 460 more stores to the mix and the customer feedback has been brilliant. We’ve had people queuing outside our stores before dawn, 4 am.” WATCH:  EWN takes on Black Friday
