                                         JOHANNESBURG - In a desperate rescue attempt in Indonesia, half a pod of sperm whales have been saved after they beached off the Aceh coast. WWF Indonesia confirmed 10 whales were stranded on Monday, seven of whom were returned to the water by Navy officials. Three other whales died on the beach. Earlier this year, New Zealand saw one of its worst stranding events in history, when more than 400 pilot whales beached on Farewell Spit on the tip of South Island. More than 250 of whales died as rescuers desperately attempted to return them to the water.
