                                         HARARE - Rights lawyers in Zimbabwe say police have arrested an American citizen for allegedly insulting President Robert Mugabe on Twitter. The lawyers say this is the first arrest for a social media-related offence after Mugabe created a Cyber Security Ministry last month. Martha O’Donovan works for Magamba TV, a local company that specialises in political satire. According to the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, detectives raided her house in Harare early on Friday morning and confiscated her laptop and other electronic equipment.  O’Donovan is currently detained at The Harare Central Police station. She’s alleged to have insulted President Mugabe in a recent tweet on her personal timeline. The lawyers say the tweet in question made no reference to the president’s name. Mugabe’s spokesman said last month a new cybersecurity ministry had been formed to clamp down on those who, as he put it, do mischief in cyberspace.
