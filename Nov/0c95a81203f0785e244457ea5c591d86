                                         CAPE TOWN - The Ad Hoc Committee looking into political party financing has approved the draft Political Party Funding Bill. The bill introduces, for the first time, regulations that will govern private donations to political parties represented in the national and provincial legislatures. Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said: “It addresses what every South African I think agrees on, in that it ends the culture of secrecy which clouded the funding of political parties.” The bill forbids foreign funding of political parties and also puts a R15 million-a-year limit on donations from any single individual or company. “A cumulative R15 million per annum is the upper cap above which you cannot donate because we believe that beyond that, you stand a real chance of influencing policy decisions.” The committee will table its report in the National Assembly on Thursday, but the bill will only come before the House for approval after the State of The Nation Address in February 2018.
