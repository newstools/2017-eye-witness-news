                                         JOHANNESBURG -The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media & Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) will be meeting with the new SABC board on Wednesday afternoon, in a final attempt to avert a strike scheduled for Thursday. Over a thousand staff members affiliated to Bemawu have threatened the strike over a 0% salary increase. The board will be meeting with the union representatives at 2 ‘o clock, where the union hopes a new wage offer will be presented. Union spokesperson Hannes Du Buisson said: “Unfortunately, the SABC has a history of coming with fairly ridiculous offers. When we started off with negotiations this year the original demand was 15% but the real demand from employees is 10%.” The workers say they have been waiting for nine months for a salary increase.
