                                         JOHANNESBURG - Injured Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has received his face mask and looks set to face Senegal in the all-important World Cup Qualifier on Friday. Khune fractured a bone in his face in last Sunday’s Telkom Knockout victory against Chippa United. Bafana’s preparations for the game against the Lions of Teranga have been rocked by numerous setbacks that included a controversial rejection of a national call-up from midfielder Thulani Serero and injury concerns to Captain Thulani Hlatshwayo and Siphiwe Tshabalala. Khune has trained with the squad in the last two days wearing a protective mask, but his involvement in Friday’s game is still in doubt. @IIKHUNE_32_16 says thank you for the well wishes & urges you to get your tickets & #ComeShowYourLove for @BafanaBafana . @CastleLagerSA @flysaa @nikefootballza pic.twitter.com/c5wgNOXlBF
