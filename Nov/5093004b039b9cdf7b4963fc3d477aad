                                         DURBAN - Lawyers representing the so-called African National Congress (ANC) rebels have argued that the incumbent executive intends to abuse legal processes right through to the Constitutional Court just to stay in power. Judges in the Pietermaritzburg High Court have heard arguments about why they should grant the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) leave to appeal against their September ruling. In the earlier judgment, the 2015 provincial elective conference was declared unlawful. At the same time, pro-Cyril Ramaphosa campaigners have also applied for an execution order which would force the PEC to vacate the ANC offices in the province. Advocate Greg Harpur, who represents the KZN ANC, says the applicants have not argued that even if the conference was held in 2016 the result would have been different. Harpur also went on to say that the incumbent executive was democratically elected by the branches and the courts found no irregularities with the gathering’s processes. But Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi who represents the applicants has questioned why then did the PEC not re-run the elective conference when disputes arose. Ngcukaitobi has estimated that if the matter is drawn out through legal processes, it is likely to only be resolved in 2019, by which time his clients’ rights would have been diminished. Judgment has been reserved.
