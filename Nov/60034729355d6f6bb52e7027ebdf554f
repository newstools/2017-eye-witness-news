                                         CAPE TOWN - The Black First Land First (BLF) grouping has called for the deposit required to fight national and provincial elections to be scrapped. The BLF is among a range of organisations making submissions on the draft Political Party Funding Bill. Two days of public hearings kicked off at Parliament on Tuesday. The BLF says the requirement for parties to put up hefty deposits before they can register to fight elections is an attack on democracy. Spokesperson Lindsay Maasdorp said: “Political parties are currently required to pay an amount of R600,000 in order to contest elections in the whole country, R45,000 per province, R200,000 nationally. BLF calls for the repeal of the provisions of the electoral act.” The BLF says new parties should have to collect 50,000 signatures.  Meanwhile, the South African Local Government Association has appealed for political funding to be extended to municipalities But chairperson Vincent Smith says while he has sympathy for the call, the committee’s mandate is limited to political funding only at the national and provincial level.
