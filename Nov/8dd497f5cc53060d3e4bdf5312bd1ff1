                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Captured in Africa Foundation says the five lions which went missing in Fochville  in the West Rand almost two months ago, have still not been found.  The foundation says the lions have been spotted on the odd occasion by residents.  It says the area is large with no fences between farms and this allows for the lions to go undetected.  It's unclear where the lions escaped from because there are no game reserves in the area.  The foundation’s Drew Abrahamson said: “These lions are masters at being able to hide away and stay away from and because the area is such a high traffic area with regards to livestock, people, dogs, to follow up on after that is not easy.”
