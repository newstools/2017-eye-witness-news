                                         CAPE TOWN - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula is calling on Cape Town officers to "hunt down" the suspects involved in robbing an ambulance, leading to the death of a child. On Wednesday, 7-year-old Faigon Wildschut was being transported to Red Cross Children's Hospital, when the emergency vehicle was forced off the road and robbed by armed assailants. The boy eventually reached the hospital but was declared dead before noon. Mbalula has since released a statement strongly condemning the incident. The police ministry's Vuyo Mhaga said, “The minister has instructed the police to do everything they can to get the perpetrators.”
