                                         JOHANNESBURG – The Soweto Polo Cup has been postponed once again. The event was first moved to Saturday 4 November, from the initial date of 28 October, to allow the sand arena to meet the international standards required to host the event at the Soweto Equestrian Centre.. And now, it has been postponed indefinitely after the organisers’ application to host it was rejected. In a statement, co-founder Hloni Matlhare said: “Despite having the support of JMPD, EMS and Environmental, SAPS would not budge.” Matlhare says they are still committed to making the event a success and preparations are still underway. “I humbly apologise for yet again another inconvenience but as we all know, moving ahead with an event that isn't JOC [Joint Operations Committee of the City of Johannesburg] approved will result in severe repercussions.”
