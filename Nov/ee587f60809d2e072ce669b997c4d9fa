                                         JOHANNESBURG - The SABC board says it has yet to reach a decision on whom to appoint to the executive positions at the state broadcaster. The board held a media briefing on Thursday night following the abrupt resignation of one of its members, Rachel Kalidass,  who raised concerns about the executive appointment process. Kalidass claims the board's first choice of CEO has allegations of fraud and corruption against him, along with a conflict of interest. The Democratic Alliance has named the candidate as former CEO of the Land Bank Alan Mukoki. SABC Board Chair Bongumusa Makhathini said: “All members were aware of some allegations but required as a matter of good governance and fairness, [that] we check this thoroughly in view of known cases where people have been falsely accused.” Makhathini also noted that no appointment decisions have yet been made. “The process of appointing the SABC executives remains unconcluded.”
