                                         PARYS - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State has given itself before the end of Wednesday night to decide on its next move following Bloemfontein High Court ruling barring it from holdings it's elective conference this weekend. Earlier on Wednesday, the court ruled that the party's Free State provincial conference cannot go ahead as scheduled because branch general meetings held in four regions over the last four months were unconstitutional, and in breach of the ANC Constitution. The Free State ANC has already been ordered by another court to hold its elective conference this weekend because the mandate of the provincial party’s leadership expired earlier this year. This latest court ruling pushes the provincial party to defy that ruling to hold a conference. Free State ANC spokesperson Thabo Meeko said: “It has got potential to create a nightmare around logistics, we hope to be able to conclude things as soon as possible and determine our cause of action moving forward.” Meanwhile, the national party has not been available to comment on how it will help the provincial ANC out of this quagmire.
