LISTEN: SACP had no time to prove it can govern properly – analyst  When the SACP decided to test the waters by contesting elections for the first time in Metsimaholo, going head-to-head with the ANC, it knew very well this would heighten tensions with the governing party. So it briefed its alliance partner Cosatu before the elections, but the federation hasn’t given it its support. Cosatu deputy general Secretary Solly Phetoe explained: “We have the resolution coming from the 12th national congress of Cosatu to support the ANC during elections." The decision to support only the ANC during elections can be reviewed by its national congress scheduled for next year. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
