Merriam Monyane has been testifying about the condition in which she found her son at the Cullinan Care and Rehabilitation Centre. JOHANNESBURG - A woman whose son died after being moved from a Life Esidimeni facility says she still hasn't accepted that he’s gone because she’s yet to receive answers about exactly led to his death. More than 140 psychiatric patients died after the Gauteng Health Department terminated its contract with the Life Esidimeni group. WATCH: Esidimeni victims' families testify  Merriam Monyane has been testifying about the condition in which she found her son at the Cullinan Care and Rehabilitation Centre. She says her son was left to starve with no clothes or blankets. Monyane's son Thabo suffered from cerebral palsy. She says she was informed that he was being moved from the centre to Siyabadinga, another NGO in the same location, apparently to make space for other patients. However, when Siyabadinga was shut down, her son was moved back to Cullinan, where his condition deteriorated. She says she got a call from officials at the centre just days leading to his death. Monyane says when she arrived at the centre, she was barred from entering and he was wheeled to her. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
