                                         CAPE TOWN - A weather scientist says that the Western Cape will most likely not get a drop of rain, at least until autumn. The province remains in the grips of a devastating drought, with dam levels at 36% of their storage capacity. Weather scientist Cobus Olivier says that no rain is predicted, at least until March. He says the Cape won't benefit from the weather phenomenon known as La Nina. It will instead increase showers over summer rainfall areas of the country. South Africa is one of the driest countries in the world.   But there is a glimmer of hope.  Carolyn Roberts of the UK-based Knowledge Transfer Network believes droughts creep up and develop over a period of time. But she adds that very often they end suddenly with heavy rains. The City of Cape Town will be using the Atlantis-Silwerstroom Aquifer, the Cape Flats Aquifer, and Table Mountain Group Aquifer to supplement surface water supplies. Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says the city will turn off the taps when dam levels reach about 13%. Additional reporting by Kevin Brandt. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
