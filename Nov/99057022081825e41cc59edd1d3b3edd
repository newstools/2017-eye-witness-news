                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Broadcast, Electronic Media and Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) has confirmed that it will go ahead with its protest at all South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) regions across the country on Thursday. The announcement comes after a meeting between stakeholders reached a deadlock on Wednesday afternoon. The union’s Hannes du Buisson says the public broadcaster has a tendency to negotiate in bad faith. “We sincerely hope that the SABC board will soon change their attitude.”
