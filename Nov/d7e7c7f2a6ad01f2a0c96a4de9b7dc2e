                                         CAPE TOWN - Old bread kneads need not be thrown away anymore, thanks to a new initiative to give rise to sustainable food growth. Toast Ale South Africa has partnered with various companies to use their discarded bread to create craft beer. The profits from this beer will then go to Soil for Life, a non-profit organisations that trains unemployed people to grow their own food. Toast Ale's Bianca Hansen said: “They empower South Africans by giving them a year-long training programme that teaches them how to be a home gardener.  "Basically, they grow and maintain their own garden. And they end up being able to feed their family and community to eventually own an income from that. It’s really empowering the people, giving them a chance to look after themselves.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
