The blonde beauty made sure she was dressed for the occasion as she opted for a low-cut dress. LONDON - Mariah Carey immersed her designer shoes and manicured hands into cement at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angles on Wednesday as she was recognised for her outstanding contribution to music. The Hero hitmaker clearly didn't mind getting her hands and feet dirty as she immersed her Christian Louboutins and perfectly manicured fingers into a slab of wet clay at the movie palace - which sees celebrities across film, theatre and music, lend their limbs to the Forecourt Of The Stars - on Hollywood Boulevard. Speaking to Variety.com, the 47-year-old diva said: "It's something that feels humbling, and I feel honored by it." The blonde beauty made sure she was dressed for the occasion as she opted for a low-cut dress, which clung to her curves, and fishnets, while her long locks were twizzled over one shoulder and her wrists were layered with white crystal-embellished jewels. Carey appeared to be in her element as she lapped up the attention during the big unveiling ceremony, in which she lent on a plush red cushion and pressed her hands into the box, before a group of handsome male assistants rushed to her aid to help her stable herself when she plunged her killer heels into the wet rock. The Touch My Body singer flashed her muddy mits to onlookers while her boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, pulled out his mobile phone and snapped away to ensure he got her best angles. Despite her diva reputation, Carey - who has six-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe with her estranged husband Nick Cannon - has made waves in the music industry for years. She's sold over 200 million albums worldwide - making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time - 18 number one songs, and she's been nominated for 34 Grammy awards - five of which she has won - as well as held a residency in Las Vegas.
