                                         JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways (SAA)’s newly appointed CEO Vuyani Jarana says that his main focus will be on cutting costs and making a profit.  Jarana’s appointment as CEO has been widely welcomed after SAA chair Dudu Myeni’s term came to an end last month. Myeni was strongly accused of steering the national carrier into a financial crisis. Jarana started the job on Wednesday. He’s the airline’s first permanent CEO since 2015. He says that he wants the airline to make money again. “We’re going to focus on the commercial delivery side of things. Your route optimisation, you fly routes that are profitable for you and you look at the network effects.  “So you have to look at everything. The single consideration has to be the commercial viability of your decisions.”
