                                         CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town mother and her baby are both doing well in hospital after the mother gave birth on the N1 earlier on Friday morning. The mother was on her way to hospital when a senior traffic officer Amanda Fojo realised they had to deliver the baby on the scene. The city's Maxine Bezuidenhout said: “Officer Fojo assessed the situation and realised that the baby’s arrival was imminent so she put her mid-wife skills to good use and helped the lady deliver a healthy baby boy. Traffic officers then escorted mother and baby to Mowbray Maternity Hospital and both are in good health.”
