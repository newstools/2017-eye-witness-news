                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe  has reportedly said he's in favour of resuming executions, after more than a decade, in response to rising murder rates. The Associated Press is reporting he made the comments on Wednesday while speaking at a burial service for a political ally. The hangman's job has been vacant in Zimbabwe since 2005, but the justice ministry has said there’s been a "flood" of applications in the economically struggling nation in recent months.  More than 90 people are currently on death row, although Zimbabwe hasn’t executed any prisoners in the past 12 years. Rights groups have called on the authorities to abolish the death penalty, which still applies to men who were aged between 21 and 70 when they committed their crimes.
