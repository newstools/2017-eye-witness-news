Earlier this week, four people, including two children, were shot and wounded in the area. A resident explains that the shooter opened fire despite young children playing in the street. He says he helped a six-year-old girl who was wounded. “I just grabbed her. Her uncle also wanted to grab her. He took off his t-shirt and put it around her where they shot her in the leg. He put her in a bakkie and took her to hospital.” The girl is in a stable condition. A boy and two men have also been hospitalised. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
