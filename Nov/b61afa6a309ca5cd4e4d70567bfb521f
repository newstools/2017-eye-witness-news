                                         JOHANNESBURG - The City of Johannesburg says a suspect linked to the assault of a Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) officer in Hillbrow has been arrested. Members of The Revelation Church of God attacked officer Simphiwe Sebati on Sunday after he tried to tow an illegally parked vehicle belonging to a member of the congregation. The city's Luyanda Mfeka says while the officer has been discharged from the hospital, the city views the attack as a revolt against the rule of law. ‚ÄúWe certainly believe that the attack was not just an attack on the JMPD officer in question, but ultimately an attack on the residents of the city and the city‚Äôs rule of law. We cannot allow for this kind of criminal activity to persist.‚Äù #countryDutyLawlessness can never be allowed!!Joburg CBD is a thug haven Disarming of a JMPD officer like that is pure criminal. üìπ@MakeSAsafe pic.twitter.com/dnnKVtGvMh
