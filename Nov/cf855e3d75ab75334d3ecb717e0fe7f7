                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts have reacted to Jacques Pauw’s book The President’s Keepers, telling Eyewitness News that if the contents of the book about President Jacob Zuma are correct, then the law must take its course. The book contains allegations against President Jacob Zuma relating to corruption and irregularities with his tax affairs. The book also links him to tobacco smugglers.  ANC stalwart Wally Serote has described as shocking details contained in Pauw’s book.  “If what he’s saying is true, that is grievous for our country.”  He says if true they want to see action being taken against the president.  “If it is true, the process of the law will have to take its course, that’s all.” The stalwarts have previously called on the president to step down, saying that there are just too many scandals surrounding him.
