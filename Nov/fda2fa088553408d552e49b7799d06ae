                                         HARARE - Illegal gold miners have invaded a busy suburb in Zimbabwe's second largest city Bulawayo. The miners are digging large trenches and have even threatened to burrow their way into a private home. This latest gold rush is in Bulawayo’s Matsheumhlope suburb, in the east of the city, putting people’s homes and health at risk. Hundreds of illegal miners, known locally as amakorokoza, have invaded the area within the last few days and are said to be working in gangs. The state ZBC radio says one piece of land in the suburb has been reduced to gullies, and the miners are threatening to dig through at least one house. So far there are no reports of the authorities taking action against the miners. The gangs claim to find up to 30 grams of gold a day.
