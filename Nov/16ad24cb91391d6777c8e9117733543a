                                         JOHANNESBURG - Parents of pupils in grade 1 and 8  who have not yet applied for the 2018 academic year have until midnight on Friday to do so, as the online registration grace period draws to a close. The Gauteng Education Department has once again urged parents who have not yet applied to do so urgently. It says Gauteng schools are full and no new applications will be processed in January. The department's Steve Mabona said: “Parents who applied during the admission period in May, don’t need to apply again but we urge those who might have not been placed to visit the district office.”
