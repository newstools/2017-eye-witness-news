                                         DURBAN - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says it will support and serve Cyril Ramaphosa without pain if he becomes president of the party. The provincial leadership held an open discussion with journalists in Durban on Thursday, responding to a series of questions including the succession race. The KZN ANC has also provided statistics on how their branches have voted in meetings so far with Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma leading overwhelmingly in most regions. “If the impossible happens… that Comrade Ramaphosa emerges as president, we will remain in the ANC.” KZN ANC Youth League chair Kwazi Mshengu says if Ramaphosa becomes president they will support him with the same vigour as they would Dlamini Zuma. But in the same breath, Mshengu has admitted that the KZN ANC is dissatisfied with how Ramaphosa has been campaigning. “We remain deeply worries by the posture, particularly taken by the deputy president, to insulate himself from the challenges facing the ANC.” With around 500 branches still expected to meet and nominate leaders, the KZN ANC is confident that it will have strong numbers in support of Dlamini Zuma at the December conference.
