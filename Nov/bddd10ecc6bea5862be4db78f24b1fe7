                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has criticised what it calls superficial talks and mechanical solutions in the name of unity in the build-up to the African National Congress (ANC)'s elective conference next month. Last week, President Jacob Zuma invited all the presidential candidates for dinner, saying he was concerned about events leading up to the gathering. President Zuma’s meeting with the candidates was a clear attempt to achieve unity ahead of the conference. There was another meeting with the party’s provincial chairpersons earlier this week, with unity at the top of the agenda. Cosatu’s Sello Phetoe said: “We remain unconvinced by the superficial talks and mechanical solutions in the name of unity.” The federation says the solution for unity in the ANC is to simply adopt a principle that says a deputy president should succeed the president, saying it's not too late to endorse this.
