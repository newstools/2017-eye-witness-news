                                         JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says he doesn't yet have a view on whether a move by the State Security Agency to stop the further publication of Jacques Pauw’s book The President's Keepers, is a credible one. He’s been asked about the court action by the Democratic Alliance (DA) during question time in the National Assembly on Thursday afternoon. Ramaphosa has confirmed that while he's reading the book, he is hesitant about attempts to muzzle the media. Ramaphosa says he can't yet form a definitive opinion about the controversial book. Since its release, it’s become almost commonplace for opposition MPs to wave the book around in the two Houses of Parliament, especially when addressed by President Jacob Zuma.

The media in terms of our Constitution should be free and fair.” WATCH: Eusebius Mckaiser in conversation with Jacques Pauw  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
