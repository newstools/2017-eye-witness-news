The party says that whoever wins will have the task to lead the party to victory in 2019. Over 1,000 DA members in Gauteng registered to vote in the party's elective congress currently underway in Midrand. Addressing the delegates is the party's leadership and leader Mmusi Maimane, as well as the three mayors in Gauteng - Bongani Baloyi, Solly Msimanga and Herman Mashaba. There were loud cheers when Maimane addressed delegates, who are voting for a new provincial leadership ahead of the 2019 elections. "Your hard work helped us from a government in the city of Johannesburg and become the biggest party in the city of Tshwane in a coalition government with partners from all other parties." The current provincial leader John Moodey is also running to retain his position. "I promise that we will govern not only in Midvaal but more municipalities and even metros and we will achieve that success... and did achieve that success. Today I'm asking you to renew my mandate." Contesting Moodey's position to lead the party in the province is Ghaleb Cachalia. He believes that he brings a fresh perspective and a brand bew beginning.
