                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma is on Thursday expected to shed light on the legal fees racked up in his lengthy battle over the National Prosecution Authority’s decision to drop fraud, corruption and racketeering charges against him. It’s one of six questions that Zuma will deal with in the National Assembly this afternoon. Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane wants to know the costs incurred by the Presidency since the May 2009 decision, which has since been declared irrational by the courts. Zuma’s last question and answer session for the year will also see him asked by the Freedom Front Plus about the delay in appointing a permanent national police commissioner. The Congress of the People (Cope) wants to know his position on the South African Council of Churches’ unburdening panel report, The Betrayal of the Promise: How the Nation is Being Stolen. The report pointed to a shadow state feeding off public funds through a network of patronage and corruption. African National Congress questions deal with the impact of climate change on the economy, the work of the presidential infrastructure commission and poverty alleviation. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
