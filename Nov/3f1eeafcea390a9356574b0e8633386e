                                         JOHANNESBURG - Tshwane residents have been warned that a number of streets in the city centre will not be accessible to motorists due to a taxi strike on Wednesday. Taxi drivers say they are angry about the recapitalisation process, no subsidies, operating licences and other issues. The protest is set to begin in Marabastad. The National Taxi Alliance’s Theo Malele said: “We’ll start assembling in Marabastad at 8.30am and we’ll begin our march to the office of ministry at 11am.” On Monday, the Gauteng Education Department urged parents to take precautions to prioritise their children’s safety. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said the strike was planned at a critical time when many pupils are writing their year-end exams. He added a strike strategy programme has been sent to principals throughout the province.
