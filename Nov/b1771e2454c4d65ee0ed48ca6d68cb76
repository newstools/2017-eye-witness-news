                                            Proteas and Titans all-rounder Chris Morris could make his long-awaited return from injury when the Titans face the Lions in the second installment of the T20 Challenge Jukskei derby at Bidvest Wanderers on Wednesday evening. 
                                         JOHANNESBURG - All-rounder Chris Morris has recovered from his back injury and is in line to play his first game when the Titans take on the Lions in the T20 Challenge at the Bidvest Wanderers on Wednesday evening.  Morris has recovered from a back injury he sustained mid-way during the Proteas' tour of England earlier in the year.  Titans coach Mark Boucher has also decided to rest several his Proteas stars for the game against the Lions, with Aiden Markram, Quinton de Kock and Dale Steyn expected to sit out the game. The Titans are yet to taste defeat in the T20 Challenge, having won four games and one being a no result due to bad weather. The Lions, however, will be looking to redeem their loss to the Warriors in the double header in Cape Town last Sunday. In the other fixture, the Warriors have a tricky trip to Boland Park to face a resurgent Cape Cobras side.  Both fixtures get underway at 6pm.
