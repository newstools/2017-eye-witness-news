                                         NEW YORK - There's been a swift fallout for top comedian Louis CK after allegations of sexual harassment surfaced against him. At least five women have accused the Emmy-winning writer and comedian of sexually lewd behaviour. CK has been scrapped from the line-up of a comedy special called Night of too many stars hosted by Jon Stewart, created to raise money for autism. The network HBO has also removed all of his projects from their on-demand service, including various comedy specials. And the channel that releases his award-winning experimental series, Louie FX, has announced it is reviewing its relationship with the comedian. Cast members of his upcoming movie I Love You Daddy have also backed away from promoting the film.
