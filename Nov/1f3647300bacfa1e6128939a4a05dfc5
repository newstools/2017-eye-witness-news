                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former President Thabo Mbeki has decried the state of the African National Congress (ANC), saying it has been infested by a rot and captured by a dominant faction that is not ANC. Mbeki was speaking at the last day of the ANC stalwarts consultative conference in Braamfontein on Sunday. Thabo Mbeki says that the ANC needs to be recaptured. "It is clear that the ANC has been captured by a dominant faction which, in fact, is not ANC. But really what we are dealing with is a rot that has infested the organisation as a whole." He says he is surprised by what happens in the ANC. "When you wake up in the morning and see a report of money that ws supposed to have gone to some municipality has been stolen... that can't be ANC." Mbeki says that the ANC needs to be liberated from the clutches of those who have captured it.
