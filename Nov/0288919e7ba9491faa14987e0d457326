Dr Anthea Jeffery has written a report saying the general mismanagement of money is a major reason why the plan will fail. JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi says while South Africa spends a substantial amount of money on healthcare, the poor are still not receiving the benefit. Head of special research at South African Institute for Race Relations (SAIRR) Dr Anthea Jeffery has written a report warning the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) is doomed to fail. She says the general mismanagement of money is a major reason why. “The NHI will do nothing to address the problems of poor management and inefficiency in the public healthcare sector. It will put an end to the South Africa’s excellent system of private healthcare and the combination is likely to see that fewer people will have less access to healthcare than they do now.” However, the minister says Jeffery is wrong. “You give 4.4% of the GDP to only 16% of the population and give 4.1% to 84% of the population, do you expect them to be efficient? All the skills including financial management skill and the number of doctors will migrate to where there’s 4%.”
