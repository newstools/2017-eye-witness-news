                                         PRETORIA - The death toll from the plague has reached 165 in Madagascar with more than 2,000 people infected. More than three-quarters of these cases involve the highly contagious airborne pneumonic strain that can be spread by coughing or sneezing. The World Health Organisation discounts reports that 10 countries close to Madagascar, including South Africa, have been listed as high-risk areas for the worst case of the plague in 50 years. The number of infections is declining, leading scientists to believe the disease is at crisis point. As with Ebola in 2014, they fear there might be isolated cases moving beyond Africa to the United States and Europe, where it killed millions as the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century.
