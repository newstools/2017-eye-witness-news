                                         JOHANNESBURG - South African President Jacob Zuma  and his Angolan counterpart, João Lourenço, will travel to Zimbabwe on Wednesday where 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe is under growing pressure to resign. Zuma's spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga  said: “President Zuma in his capacity as chairperson of SADC as well the president of Angola should travel to Zimbabwe tomorrow morning to meet stakeholders in Zimbabwe both in government and in the army.”  Zanu-PF instructed President Mugabe to step down following the army's take over last week. His refusal to willingly relinquish power has resulted in Tuesday’s parliamentary process where a motion to impeach him has been tabled. Meanwhile, the motion to impeach Mugabe has been moved from the Zimbabwean Parliament to a local hotel. A joint sitting of the Senate and Lower House is due to start in the next few minutes.
