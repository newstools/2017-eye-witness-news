                                         CAPE TOWN - Changes are afoot to how public funds are being split among political parties. There appears to be a consensus among parties represented on an ad hoc committee of Parliament that the current formula is unfair. The committee is reviewing legislation on the funding of political parties, including disclosure by private donors and will open the debate to another round of public hearings next week. Currently, around R140 million from the public purse is split between 15 political parties in a ninety-ten split, 90%  depending on the number of seats in Parliament and the rest split equally. This means that the country’s three largest parties, the ANC, the DA and the EFF receive about 88% of the total funding. Chairperson of the ad hoc committee Vincent Smith says it’s clear this formula is unfair. “There is definitely a recognition that the 90:10 is just not on.” The committee has agreed to form a task team to crunch the numbers for alternative ratios proposed by the parties, including 80:20 and 70:30.
