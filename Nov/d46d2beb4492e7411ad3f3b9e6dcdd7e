                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament, Pravin Gordhan,  says state capture is so pervasive it grips even law enforcement agencies. Gordhan was speaking about the ANC's upcoming elective conference at the Gordon Institute for Business Science in Johannesburg on Thursday night. He says he hopes the outcome of congress will help arrest grand corruption. “Its extensive in the sense that it covers so many institutions. From institutions that are supposed to be law enforcement, to fiscal institutions, to state-owned entities.” Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has previously promised that there will not be protection for ANC leaders implicated in state capture. Gordhan says some people know they will be arrested after December. “Some people know they are going to end in jail sometime next year if there is a change in December because of what they’ve done, so obviously they are going to fight like hell to ensure that they don’t end up in jail.” When asked how many people would be arrested - he responded: “Not too many.” He says they want to see the right outcome in the ANC next month, saying there is a need to recapture the captured state. #PravinGordhan says the issue of social grants,which went through courts is tragedy.
