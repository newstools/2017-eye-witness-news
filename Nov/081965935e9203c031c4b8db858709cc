                                         JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says criminals have broken into the city's data centre stealing cables and equipment resulting in massive damage. The City of Joburg is in the processes of building its own information and communication technology services which will now be delayed due to the break-in. The mayor says the criminals failed to get into the main centre which has already been completed. Mashaba says the extent of the damage caused by this break-in will only be determined in the next few days. The mayor says the data nerve centre where cables have been damaged and stolen provides technology to the entire city. “You can’t run the world today on paper so you need technology to be able to run the city and that’s where this sabotage came in.” This centre controls the information which helps the city to receive e-mails provide wifi and operate the technology that runs the city. The police are now investigating. (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
