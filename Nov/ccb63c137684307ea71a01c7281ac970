                                         JOHANNESBURG - Justice Minister Michael Masutha says some people are trying to unravel a neatly woven inclusive society, which most South Africans are trying to build. Masutha was reacting to the appearance of a number of apartheid flags during a march by farmers and supporters to highlight farm killings. The group Enough is Enough has vowed to protest again later in November. Masutha says racism should not be used as a motive for inflicting harm on others. He says while some citizens are trying to unite the country, other are exacerbating the sensitive aspects of the past like raising the old flag. “It does not assist to cloud a legitimate course with that type of controversy. It takes away the essence of what you’re trying to convey.” The Economic Freedom Fighters has vowed to organise counter-protests if farmers and supporters take to the streets again.
