                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) is hoping a court will order President Jacob Zuma to tell the country how much the spy tapes legal battle has cost taxpayers. Zuma’s sidestepping of the question in the National Assembly last week prompted a walkout by the official opposition. He told Members of Parliament (MPs) that, by law, he is entitled to defend himself at the state’s expense. The protracted spy tapes saga has cost the DA in the order of R10 million. But how much has the president spent? He has refused to say. Mmusi Maimane says that his party will ask the Western Cape High Court to compel him to answer the question. “The question was quite simple. It was clear, it was unequivocal. It had everything to do with what we have spent on a decade-long case and the 783 charges of corruption.” The DA has also accused deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli of shielding the president from accountability by allowing Zuma to choose whether or not to answer the question. Parliament has responded to the threat of legal action by saying that it would wait for papers to be served. Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says: "Parliament will await the papers and arguments to be served in order to determine how to deal with the matter."
