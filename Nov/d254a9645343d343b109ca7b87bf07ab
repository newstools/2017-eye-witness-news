                                         CAPE TOWN – African National Congress secretary-general Gwede Mantashe says that leaders should be endorsed because they have the country and the party's best interests at heart.  Mantashe addressed delegates at the Western Cape branch's special provincial general council in Cape Town on Sunday.  Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has received the most branch nominations to succeed as party leader at the ANC's elective conference next month.  Lindiwe Sisulu garnered the most support to take over as his deputy and Mantashe as national chairperson. Mantashe says there are still many challenges within the ruling party that need to be changed. “When we elect the deputy president at the coming conference, we must have succession in mind. If we don’t, we'll just be keeping seats. We’ll have a crisis at the next conference.” He says delegates should work hard to improve the image of the party. “The biggest challenge from where we’re sitting is the image and the reputation of the ANC. The ANC is seen as equal to corruption and looting.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
