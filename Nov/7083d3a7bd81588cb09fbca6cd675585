                                         JOHANNESBURG - The University of Missouri has apologised for referencing the Netflix show “House of Cards” while advertising an internship opportunity after allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced about the show’s star, Kevin Spacey. The university had sent an email about the internship opportunity on Wednesday that said: “Experience the real-life House of Cards!” The message was also posted on a university webpage. Earlier this week, actor Anthony Rapp claimed Spacey made a sexual advance towards him when he was just 14 years old in 1986. Since then, several other men have come forward with similar allegations.
