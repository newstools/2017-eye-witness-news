                                         JOHANNESBURG - A two-year-old child has died after a fire erupted in the Foreman Road Informal Settlement in Clare Estate in Durban. Shack dwellers movement Abahlali baseMjondolo says the fire started in the early hours of Sunday morning when a candle fell resulting in the burning of the child's family home. The two-year-old was taken to a nearby hospital where she died due to her burn wounds. Eight hundred families have been affected by the fire. The organisation’s Thapepolo Mohapi says the eThekwini Municipality has not responded to the community's call for electricity in the area. “This is the very same community that was protesting earlier this year in May for electricity to be installed in the area, and the municipality has not responded.”
