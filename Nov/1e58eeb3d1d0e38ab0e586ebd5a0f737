                                         CAPE TOWN - The Stellenbosch Municipality will meet with disgruntled residents from an informal settlement outside Stellenbosch next week. This comes after a group of Longlands residents took to the streets on Friday, leading to the closure of Stellenbosch Arterial and Polkadraai roads. Residents are reportedly upset because of a lack of housing and uncertainty over their future after ownership of the farm many of them work on, changed hands. The municipality's Mart-Marie Haasbroek said: “Representatives of the Stellenbosch Municipality did meet with the Longlands residents and a meting has been scheduled for the stakeholders for Tuesday.”
