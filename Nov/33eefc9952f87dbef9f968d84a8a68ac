                                         PRETORIA - The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) has lengthened Oscar Pistorius's jail sentence from six years to thirteen years and five months.  The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) went to the SCA to appeal the sentence handed down by the High Court in Pretoria.  The former paralympic superstar shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's day in 2013.  The Supreme Court of Appeal's decision was a unanimous one - that the NPA should be granted leave to appeal and that Pistorius should recieve the maximum possible sentence in this case.  However, the court did take into account the time the Blade Runner has already served. Judge Willie Seriti handed down the order on behalf of the court. Pistorius may now have to be moved back to the Kgosi Mampuru II prison from the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre.
