CAPE TOWN - An ambitious new initiative hopes to save enough water in schools to stave off day zero by three minutes every day. There are 1,500 schools across the Western Cape and local government authorities believe a better use of water in those institutions will go a long way to alleviating the city's water crisis. Stellenbosch Professor Thinus Booysen came up with a smart water meter that measures water wastage. The idea is to give everyone in a school, from teachers to pupils, an idea of what they're using so they can change their ways. “We’re driving awareness of water and consumption. We’re trying to change people’s behaviour.” Booysen tested his device in local schools and soon attracted the attention of the Shoprite group, which has partnered with Cape Talk to make the device available to 100 schools. Shoprite CEO Pieter Engelbrecht said: “We’re going to buy the equipment. We’re going to do the maintenance that is required. And we’re going to monitor the savings.” A pilot project at Hector Pietersen High in Wallacedene has already yielded a daily saving of 40 kilolitres which translates to more than R50,000 a month.
