                                         PRETORIA - Freedom Under Law has argued that President Jacob Zuma is disqualified from appointing the prosecutions boss because he himself, stands to be prosecuted on very serious charges. The organisation, along with Corruption Watch, is asking the High Court in Pretoria to set aside the R17 million golden handshake given to former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Mxolisi Nxasana. They've asked that the money be paid back and Nxasana be reinstated. The parties also want the court to order that the power to appoint the national director of public prosecutions (NDPP) should fall on the deputy president. Advocate Wim Trengove referred to the recent Spy Tapes judgment, which he says demonstrates President Zuma’s interest in appointing the prosecutions boss. “What it shows is how the president and the NPA joined forces to run a case for eight years, which they in the death conceded was stillborn from the outset.” Trengove referred to law which requires the president not to expose himself to conflict between official responsibilities and private interests. “That disqualifies the president from appointing the NDPP because he cannot make that appointment while he stands to be prosecuted on very serious charges.” He says the president has worked together with the NPA to defeat the attempts to reinstate charges against him.
