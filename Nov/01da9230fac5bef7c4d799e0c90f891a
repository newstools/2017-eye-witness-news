                                         CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Lindiwe Sisulu  has responded to Cyril Ramaphosa's decision to name his running mate by saying she does not support "slate politics." Ramaphosa has dropped Sisulu as his potential ally, opting instead to tap Naledi Pandor to be his deputy. In a surprise move, he named the five people he would like to see elected alongside him to the party's top six posts when the ANC chooses new leadership next month. Sisulu's campaign says she was approached by Ramaphosa's team to be his running mate, but she turned down the offer. She refused because not only does she not believe in slates, Sisulu feels she is ready to lead the ANC herself. Campaign spokesperson Phakamile Ximiya said: “She has refused to have a slate of her own, she is standing as an individual, saying I am ready to become president of the ANC.” Slate politics is the practice of contesting an election as a block in the hope of consolidating power around allies. Sisulu says she wants to do away with slates because it is a foreign practice that will eventually destroy the ANC.
