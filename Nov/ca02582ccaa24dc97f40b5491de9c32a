                                         CAPE TOWN - Economist professor Joe Stiglitz says Africa can achieve the same economic growth that was enjoyed by East Asian countries. But he says a different strategy will be needed. Stiglitz says countries like Korea and Malaysia developed rapidly through export-led manufacturing. But he says African countries will not be able to use the same strategy to achieve the same benefits over a similar period. The Nobel laureate was addressing a summit on economic growth in Cape Town. Professor Stiglitz says the manufacturing-led export growth strategies that saw east Asian countries rapidly develop into economic powerhouses have run their course and will not work to achieve similar success in Sub-Saharan Africa. Stiglitz says this doesn’t mean countries in the region can’t successfully grow and transform their economies, but he says a multifaceted strategy is needed. “A multifaceted strategy involving all the major sectors has a prospect of obtaining the same success as the old manufacturing export strategy if it’s structured correctly.” Stiglitz has emphasised that this means government would have to a play an important role.
