                                         JOHANNESBURG - With Laudium businessman Omar Carrim missing for more than 102 days and despite his family paying a huge ransom for his return, his whereabouts remain unknown. The 76-year-old was kidnapped on 3 August, after leaving his business, Home Hyper City in the CBD. A massive search was launched, and police later found his burnt-out Mercedes at the Schurwerg Mountains in Pretoria West. Family spokesperson Yusuf Abramjee says Carrim is not well and the family is making another appeal to the kidnappers for his release. “We’ve repeatedly made an appeal to his kidnappers to release him but they have not. A report in a weekend newspaper suggest that the family has paid a large sum for ransom weeks ago, but he’s yet to be returned to his family.” Abramjee says the recent kidnappings of high profile businessman are of great concern. “I’ll be taking up the matter again with the Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula to see how law enforcement, not only in South Africa but internationally, can clampdown and stop these thugs from continuing to intimidate and terrorise our community.” The Carrim family have called on South Africans to pray for the safe return of their father.
