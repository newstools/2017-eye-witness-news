                                         JOHANNESBURG - The presidency has strongly denied reports that President Jacob Zuma was about to announce free higher education during his State of the Nation Address this year but was stopped by Treasury. The Sunday Times is reporting that Zuma wanted to make the announcement in February but had been put off by senior officials in Treasury who scrambled to stop him. He denies this allegation saying he appointed the commission of inquiry into the feasibility of funding higher education headed by judge John Heher and waited for it to conclude its business. He says at no stage was his plan to undermine the commissions' work by making any premature announcements. The president's spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said, “Any action will come from careful consideration of structures in government.” Zuma is expected to release his findings after studying the Heher report soon.
