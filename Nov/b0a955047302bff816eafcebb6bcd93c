                                         CAPE TOWN - The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) says Wednesday’s decision by Parliament to increase paternity leave and hike salaries during maternity leave will have positive effects on companies. History was made in Parliament when a private members bill was passed for the first time in the National Assembly. The Labour Laws Amendment Bill seeks to give dads extended paternity leave. The party’s Cheryllyn Dudley said: “Paternity leave is 10 days and then there’s exciting news for adoption leave which is 10 weeks. If there are two parents involved, one can apply for adoption leave and the other for parental leave.” She says the bill also brings good news for mothers. “Maternity leave of four months has been around 55% and with this amendment, it goes to 66% of person’s salary.”
