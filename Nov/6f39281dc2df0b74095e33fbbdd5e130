                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Youth League in Tshwane says that it is deeply saddened by what it calls "the evil, racist, barbaric and callous acts" of a Bronkhorstspruit man who allegedly raped his domestic worker and forced her to perform acts of bestiality. The 45-year-old man apparently raped the woman while his parents were in the house at the time. It is understood that the suspect dragged the woman into his room, where he attacked her and forced her to perform acts of bestiality with his dog. The man briefly appeared in the local magistrates court last week where his case was postponed to this week. The youth league's Nicholas Munyai said: “We view this as a continuous arrogance that is displayed by wealthy Afrikaners who continue to use our black sisters as nothing else but toys.”
