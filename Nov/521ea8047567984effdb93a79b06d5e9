                                         CAPE TOWN - The Cape of Good Hope SPCA says its members are no strangers to hijackings while out in the field. An inspector at the Animal Welfare Society was shot during a hijacking in Philippi on Monday. The specially-fitted vehicle was targeted close to the organisation's offices and recovered hours later near Sweet Home Farm.  The Cape of Good Hope SPCA's Belinda Abraham says their workers are too often exposed to threats of bodily harm. “Since the beginning of this year, all of our collection officers have had experiences where they felt extremely uncomfortable or threatened.” Abraham says workers experience high levels of trauma while out in the field.
