                                         JOHANNESBURG - Executive director of United Nations Women Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka says the avalanche of sexual misconduct allegations that have rattled Hollywood, United States media and beyond is just the beginning. She's told news agency AFP that she expects many more women to come forward before behaviours change. The wave of scandals in America has felled the careers of some of the most high-profile men in entertainment and has compelled companies to take a second look at their policies against sexual harassment in the workplace. Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein faces accusations from around 100 women since a New York Times expose early last month, with allegations ranging from harassment to rape. Actor Kevin Spacey, politicians in the United States, France and Britain also face serious allegations of misconduct while a social media campaign with the #MeToo has drawn millions of posts.
