                                         CAPE TOWN - The world woke up on Wednesday to the news that the military in Zimbabwe had seized power and was holding President Robert Mugabe and his family safe. Armoured vehicles blocked roads to the main government offices, parliament and the courts in central Harare. According to President Jacob Zuma, the only ruler the country has known in its 37 years of independence is fine in his home. Although little is known about the military’s plans and whether the apparent military coup will bring an end to Mugabe’s rule; media reports have suggested that First Lady Grace Mugabe left the country. Grace Mugabe was reported to have been eyeing the role of head of state. According to Reuters, the main goal of the generals appeared to be preventing Mugabe’s wife Grace, 41 years his junior, from succeeding him. But whether or not he remains in office, it is likely to mark the end of the total dominance of the country by Mugabe, the last of Africa’s generation of anti-colonial state founders still in power and one of the continent’s most polarising figures. Social media networks have been abuzz with people sharing their views over the situation in Zimbabwe.    Additional reporting by Reuters.
