                                         PRETORIA - The case against forensic consultant Paul O'Sullivan, his assistant and two Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) officials has been provisionally struck off the roll. The four appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Wednesday where the charge sheet was presented to them, containing 34 counts including corruption, fraud and racketeering. The case was opened by former acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and is linked to Ipid's fraud and corruption investigation into his conduct. After presenting the charge sheet to the accused, the State prosecutor asked the court for yet another postponement. The State said it needed more time to further investigate the case and may soon add more accused to the charge sheet. The attorneys for Oâ€™Sullivan, his assistant Sarah-Jane Trent and Ipid investigators Mandla Mahlangu and Temane Binang objected. The defence teams argued that the matter was being unduly delayed and was prejudicing their clients; the magistrate agreed. The matter has been removed from the roll but can be re-enrolled when the State is ready to proceed.
