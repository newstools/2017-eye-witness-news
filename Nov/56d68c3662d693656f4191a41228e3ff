                                         JOHANNESBURG- James Okwuosa cancelled out Edward Manqele's strike, as Free State Stars and Chippa United played out to a 1-1 draw at Goble Park on Wednesday night.  The encounter failed to produce any early excitement, even though Chippa United enjoyed most of the possession. The best chance of the first half came from the Chilli Boys, when Kurt Lentjiesâ€™ free-kick went narrowly wide of the posts.  It took up until the 87th minute for any of the sides to break the deadlock, and it was the home side Free State Stars who got on the scoreboard through an Edward Manqele strike. That joy was short lived though as two minutes later, James Okwuosa headed home a Menzi Masuku corner, and both teams shared the points. In other results from Wednesday night, Amazulu missed a penalty in their goalless draw with Kaizer Chiefs at the King Zwelithini Stadium, Bloemfontein Celtic and Platinum Stars also failed to score at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium, and there were no goals between Polokwane City and Maritzburg United at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium.
