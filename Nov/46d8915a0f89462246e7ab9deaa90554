                                         JOHANNESBURG- Former Banyana Banyana international, and current interim coach, Desiree Ellis says that she is interested in coaching the national side on a permanent basis.   Speaking to EWN Sport, Ellis says that she has what it takes to guide Banyana Banyana forward, and won’t be intimidated by the pressure of being head coach.  “When I was appointed as the interim coach, I felt I was ready, and if I wasn’t I was not going to accept the role.”  Ellis has been the interim coach of Banyana Banyana since Vera Pauw left the head coach position in August last year.  Recently, Ellis has lead Banyana to the Cosafa Cup title, which has seen the team being nominated for CAF’s Women’s Team of the Year award.  The former Banyana Banyana captain expressed her unwavering love for the national team.  “I love this team and if I could, I would play for it again, but my focus is on making this team competitive and I am ready to do that.”  Ellis also says that should the opportunity present itself, she will not be shy to take it.  “In life there are no guarantees and you must prepare as well as you possibly can, but if the opportunity arises to coach the national side on a permanent basis then I will not be shy to take it.” Banyana Banyana will be looking to win the CAF Women’s Team of the Year award at the awards ceremony on 4 January in Accra, Ghana.
