                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma’s been accused in Parliament of undermining the budget process. Debating the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill  on Monday afternoon, opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) flagged the sudden resignation of Treasury’s budget office head, Michael Sachs, and claimed Zuma was treating public funds as if they came “from his own pocket”. The Division of Revenue Amendment Bill contains the new funding allocations for national, provincial and local government tabled by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba during his medium-term budget policy statement last month. The Economic Freedom Fighters won’t support the bill, with MP Thembinkosi Rawula saying it would be like giving the African National Congress (ANC) permission to “continue looting the public purse” without regard for “sound and practical budgeting”. “The ANC in Parliament has clearly demonstrated it does not respect value or is interested in following the processes of the PFMA, sound and practical budgeting, instead, Mr Zuma does as he pleases without consequences. "He treats our tax money as if it was his own pocket, where he just takes… without consequences.” The Democratic Alliance (DA)'s David Maynier accused the president of turning the budget process into “a bowl of spaghetti” amid a fiscal crisis and causing the resignation of Sachs. “The fact is his resignation is a huge blow to National Treasury – and confirms our fears that decision-making about budget priorities, and indeed the budget itself, have now been centralised under President Jacob Zuma.” ANC MPs insisted Treasury is still in charge and that qualified people remain.
