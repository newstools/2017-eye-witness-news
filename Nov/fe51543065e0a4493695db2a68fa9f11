                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Economic Development MEC Lebogang Maile has warned of increased raids on illegal drinking holes and those that sell alcohol beyond the 2am cut off. The Johannesburg High Court last week ruled that shebeen permit holders are eligible to trade for the next two years on their existing permit until October 2019. Maile says that this has created a huge administrative task for the Gauteng Liquor Board to review some parts of the liquor licensing regulations.  He also says some permits should not be extended, as business owners continue to contravene the Gauteng Liquor Act of 2003. “There are many places that sell alcohol after 2am, hence these regular police raids. We will continue to work with police to clampdown on people selling illegally.” The liquor board has already fined Cubana in Fourways R150,000 for serving alcohol after 2am.
