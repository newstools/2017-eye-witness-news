                                         CAPE TOWN - Fire inspectors are expected to assess damage to properties in Gordon’s Bay following a massive fire. The fire started on Tuesday afternoon on Sir Lowry's Pass and quickly spread to the seaside town.  It destroyed or damaged five properties. Mary-Ann’s Emporium and Eatery on Sir Lowry’s Road is no more. All that’s left of the vegan restaurant is the charred remains of an empty building. There’s a small fire still burning inside.  One of the employees sits in a daze on the ground, crying silently. Mary-Ann Shearer explains that her shop, which also housed a small school, burning down was a freak occurrence as the fire moved past other properties. “The fire hopped from his property onto our back fence, shot over to the warehouse. Some of the wood caught alight. There was a little car parked there and that exploded. The gas bottle also exploded.” Shearer says she didn’t only lose her business. “There were staff living on the property, two staff members. They have nothing.” Firefighting efforts continue in the area.  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
