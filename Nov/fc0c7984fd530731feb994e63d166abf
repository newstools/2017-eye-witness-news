                                         CAPE TOWN - Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane  has told Members of Parliament (MPs) that she intends appealing a High Court ruling that limits her powers at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). In October, the High Court in Pretoria ruled that members of the SABC board don’t need ministerial approval to appoint the public broadcaster’s top three executives. The ruling also clarified the circumstances under which a board member can be removed. Kubayi-Ngubane briefed Parliament’s Communications Portfolio committee on Tuesday.  The judgment was a victory for lobby groups fighting for the independence of the public broadcaster.  But Kubayi-Ngubane believes aspects of it are unclear.  “You seem to get a sense that the judgment was rushed when you read it. So, there are issues there that we need to look at.” Democratic Alliance MP Phumzile van Damme says Kubayi’s decision is very disappointing.  “If it’s correct as the minister says that a lot of the matters don’t have clarity and she wants clarity, all she needs to do then is get a declaratory order… and say to the court one, two, three, four, five, six is unclear, can you issue a declaratory order.” Van Damme says the judgment aims to prevent the minister from abusing her power and confirms the Broadcasting Act as the legislation governing the SABC.
