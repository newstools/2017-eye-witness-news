                                         CAPE TOWN - The middleman in the Jayde Panayiotou murder is now likely to stand trial. Judge Dayalin Chetty has on Thursday ruled Luthando Siyoni is not indemnified from prosecution. The court has already found the former bouncer for Christopher Panayiotou helped the Port Elizabeth (PE) businessman find hitmen to murder his wife in April 2015. Sentencing proceedings concluded against Panayiotou, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko. But the court also heard a warrant of arrest will be issued soon for Siyoni. Siyoni turned State witness shortly after he was arrested and participated in a police sting operation in which Panayiotou implicated himself in his wife's murder. However, the middleman changed his story in court, claiming he was forced to co-operate with police. He was declared a hostile witness after he recanted on his police statement and refused to answer questions put to him by the State. Panayiotou, Nenembe and Sibeko will be sentenced on Friday.
