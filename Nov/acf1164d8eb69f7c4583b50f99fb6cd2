                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has welcomed a decision to set up an inquiry into its tax collection challenges.   Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has been given the green light by President Jacob Zuma to establish the probe, which will look into, among other issues, institutional problems.  Sars head of revenue and research Randall Carolissen says that they have a duty to account to taxpayers. “Allow this process to take its course and I think the facts will establish themselves. If people have space to answer, then let them answer for that and help people be accountable for what’s in the public domain.” Gigaba said that the inquiry has the duty to look into ways to improve the capacity of Sars if need be. He said concerns that have been raised about the revenue service cannot be ignored. “Whether founded on fact or not, it is important that we should not be dismissive of such concerns, but we look into them by engaging dedicated teams of experts.” Gigaba said factors contributing to the under collection of tax will also be looked into. “There could also be other factors such as weakening tax morality. It is important for us to look at other ways that may need to be taken in order to improve the capacity.” Gigaba has appealed that the inquiry should not be pre-empted and for the process to take its course.
