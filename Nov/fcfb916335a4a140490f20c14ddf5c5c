                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has been recalled as Zanu-PF leader and has been given a deadline of midday on Monday to leave the presidency. If Mugabe refuses to go, impeachment proceedings will begin on Tuesday. Grace Mugabe, Johathan Moyo and Walter Mzembe have also been expelled from the party, with the first lady removed as head of the women's league. The governing party met on Sunday for a special central committee session at its headquarters in Harare.     This follows a military takeover of government last week and a nationwide march demanding Mugabe to step down on Saturday. Zanu-PF’s Patrick Chinamasa could hardly finish his announcements as celebrations broke when he declared the official axing of Mugabe as party leader. Mugabe has been given just under 24 hours to resign as the country’s president. The party has also effectively decided to reinstate fired vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa as party leader and interim president of the country.
