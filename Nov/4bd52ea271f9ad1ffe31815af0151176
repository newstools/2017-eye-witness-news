                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliamentarians have been told that Trillian’s fledgling management consulting arm charged Eskom around R30 million for seemingly not doing any work. Former Trillian staffer turned whistle-blower, Bianca Goodson, says that the company had just two employees, including herself, when it sent Eskom CFO Anoj Singh an invoice for developing a corporate plan in early 2016. She’s been telling Parliament’s Public Enterprises portfolio committee everything she knows about how the controversial firm scored deals with state-owned companies. Goodson served as CEO of Trillian Management Consulting for four months in early 2016. She was asked to explain who drew up the corporate plan that the company charged Eskom R30.6 million for. "I don't know, is my answer." In its early days, the firm had a staff complement of just two. It had no business profile or corporate history, yet, it was getting work from state-owned enterprises like Eskom. "Those two employees did not do this work because I was one of them. The other one reported to me." According to Goodson’s testimony, the company earned money by introducing international firms to state-owned enterprises. Until recently, Trillian Capital Partners was controlled by Gupta ally, Salim Essa, who had close ties with board members and executive managers of state-owned companies.
