                                         SASOLBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Free State Deputy Chair Thabo Manyoni has called on the national party to intervene in the province immediately to stop what he calls "senseless and irresponsible acts" by the party's provincial chair Ace Magashule. Manyoni was reacting to Wednesday's Bloemfontein High Court ruling that the party's Free State provincial conference cannot go ahead as planned this weekend because branch general meetings held in four regions over the last four months were unconstitutional. On Tuesday, Magashule had this to say about his deputy Manyoni, who was absent from the provincial general council that nominated Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma for president. “Don’t worry about Manyoni, he’s my brother and he sits in the PEC; we talk in the PEC and we’re united.” Manyoni has now released a statement rejecting what he describes as “a bogus general council” whose delegates represented branches that were nullified by the appeals committee. He says he feels vindicated after the court ruling, adding that it shows that Magashule doesn’t deserve to lead the ANC even for a moment. He’s called on ANC members currently involved in unconstitutional branches to stop helping Magashule in his efforts to further destroy the ANC.
