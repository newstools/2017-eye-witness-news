                                         JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says that it has extended its 48-hour strike notice in the coal sector until Monday.  It says this decision comes because some of the coal companies are proposing a new wage offer to its members. On Thursday, NUM served a 48-hour notice to the Chamber of Mines for a strike that was due to commence on Sunday.  The union is demanding a R1,100 once-off wage increase this year and an 8% wage increase for 2018, while the employer is offering R600 and a 7.5% wage increase for 2018 and 2019 respectively. NUM's Livhuwani Mammburu: "The coal mining companies will present their latest offer, so we are giving them until Monday. If we are happy with the offer, we might sign but if we are not happy, we will immediately file for a 48-hour notice to strike."
