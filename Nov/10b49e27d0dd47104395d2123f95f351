                                         ZIMBABWE – Four people have been arrested for booing first lady Grace Mugabe  at a rally.  They were allegedly part of a group of people who disrupted her speech in Bulawayo last Saturday. The suspects, three men and a woman, are alleged to have sung the words: "We hate what you’re doing", while making hand gestures and booing at the first lady. The state-run Herald says the four are being charged with undermining President Robert Mugabe’s authority. A Bulawayo magistrate is on Friday due to rule on whether they can be released on bail. Mugabe accused his vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa of organising disturbances at the rally. Mnangagwa has since been sacked and expelled from the ruling party. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
