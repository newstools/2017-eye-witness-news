                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe's opposition party the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says that it is concerned that the growing tensions within the governing party may spill over into government and the rest of the country. The comments follow the axing of former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa this week, for allegedly fanning factionalism in the Zanu-PF and plotting to overthrow Robert Mugabe. Mnangagwa is reportedly in hiding from security forces. Local media organisations on Wednesday reported that Mnangagwa had sought refuge in a private home after his attempts to flee to South Africa fell short. MDC deputy president Nelson Chamisa says that there are clear tensions growing in the Zanu-PF. “It is very dangerous. It is a political time bomb and tensions are growing.” Chamisa is calling for global organisations to stand in solidarity against Mugabe. He says that Zanu-PF's challenges present an opportune moment for citizens to register and vote against the party in the coming elections. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
