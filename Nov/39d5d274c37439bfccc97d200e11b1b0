                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy Police Minister Bongani Mkongi has reiterated the need for authorities to find out who is supplying illegal firearms to criminals. Mkongi helped launch the police's festive season safety campaign in Bellville on Thursday. Mkongi says officers are ready to deal with an expected spike in mall robberies and cash heists generally seen in the run-up to the festive period. “During November, December and January, if those criminals think AK47s are presents to be wasted and put in the face of police, police must respond. They must not be weak. If you are weak, you’ll be dead.” WATCH: WC police launch festive season plan  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
