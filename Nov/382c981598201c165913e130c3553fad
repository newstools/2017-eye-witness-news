                                         JOHANNESBURG - ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe held a briefing at the party’s Luthuli House Headquarters on Tuesday afternoon to provides feedback on the party's special national executive committee meeting. Mantashe said he’s disappointed in those that pushed rumours that his possible removal was discussed at the ANC special NEC meeting at the weekend. “I’m left with four weeks to the end of my second term and people are in a hurry to suspend me instead of allowing me to finish my term.” It was reported on Monday that some NEC members called on Mantashe to be sacked for his handling of the Eastern Cape conference that turned violent. Mantashe has called on the media to be cautious of being used by factions. “I was disappointed by a number of journalists that I respect because when you work with journalists you develop respect for them, but when they do things that are strange they lose that respect.”  He will also give the party's reaction to the Fees Commission report on the viability of free higher education.
