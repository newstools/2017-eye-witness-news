                                         JOHANNESBURG - The 18th Annual Steve Biko Memorial Lecture is taking place at Unisa.  The lecture is combined - in this year of the 40th commemoration of the death of Bantu Stephen Biko, and in the year in which he would have been 70 years old - with the conferring of a posthumous honorary doctorate on Bantu Stephen Biko by Unisa.  This year's lecture is delivered by Dr Ibbo Mandaza.  He is an internationally renowned speaker analyst, author and academic, and executive chairman of the Southern African Political Economy Series Trust.  Among many issues to be addressed Mandaza will reflect on the psychological aspects of Black Consciousness and Steve Biko in the context of the current narrative of "Africa Rising" and the challenges that are being faced.
