                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament's Police Portfolio Committee has proposed a list of eight measures needed to deal with gender violence. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman on Tuesday made the proposals in a speech during the debate on the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign in the National Assembly. The campaign runs every year from the 25 November to the 10 December and is aimed at raising awareness about the negative impact of violence against women and children. Beukman says that the aim of these measures is to strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to combat gender violence. “It mainly concentrates on the management of dealing with complaints pertaining to violence and also consequence management for all SAPS members who do not adhere to requirements in this regard.” Among the list, Beukman says there should be an allocation of additional resources to the South African Police Services’ Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) units. The committee believes there should be ongoing training and capacity-building programmes for the police's first responders who deal with victims of domestic and sexual violence. It says there should be consequences for police members at all levels who respond inadequately to victims’ complaints. Beukman adds that awareness campaigns should also be increased countrywide to educate learners at schools, churches and local communities.
