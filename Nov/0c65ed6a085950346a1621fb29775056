                                         CAPE TOWN - Mayor Patricia de Lille  has been given 10 days to respond to a Democratic Alliance (DA) committee investigating a fall out between her and mayoral committee member JP Smith. They were banned from all party activity almost two months ago after De Lille's decision to close down a special investigating unit in the city turned into a public spat. De Lille is also under fire from an executive director in her office, who has this week accused her of ignoring corruption in the city's transport authority. A special sub-committee of the DA's Federal Executive, headed by parliamentary whip John Steenhuisen, has over the weeks been interviewing witnesses on a voluntary basis. Eyewitness News understands that while Smith chose to state his case in person before the committee, De Lille declined to do the same. Steenhuisen says she's now been handed a final list of questions, allegations and observations for a response. Based on these, the committee will wrap up its findings and report back to the Federal Executive. Until then, De Lille and Smith remain on special leave from party activity and are gagged from speaking to the media about the issue.
