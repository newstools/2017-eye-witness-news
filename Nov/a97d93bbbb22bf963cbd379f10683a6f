                                         JOHANNESBURG - There are fresh calls on Wednesday morning for former Deputy Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Manana  to be sacked from Parliament following his conviction and subsequent sentencing.  Manana was this week ordered to spend a year in jail or pay a fine R100,000 for assaulting three women at a Fourways nightclub. NGO Sonke Gender Justice continues to call for the removal of Manana from Parliament, considering his conviction and sentencing.  The NGO's Marike Keller says that while they welcome the sentencing, it’s concerning that he still serves as a member of Parliament.  “Our leaders need to set an example and be held accountable.” Parliament announced last week that as a backbencher, Manana will now take up a seat for the ANC on the human settlements portfolio committee. Sonke Gender Justice says that this lack of sanction by government against Manana is inconsistent with its commitments to end violence against women. “We can’t end gender-based violence or violence against women as a country or government without our representatives holding themselves accountable.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
