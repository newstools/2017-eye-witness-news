                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) has reacted to the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)’s failed motion on the nationalisation of banks without compensation, saying that the only person who can make this happen is Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. The organisaton says that it is disappointed that the red berets didn’t raise the motion with genuine motives to contribute to the transformation of the financial sector. The league’s secretary-general Meokgo Matuba says that transformation in the sector will only be achieved if Dlamini Zuma emerges as president after the governing party’s elective conference next month. “The ANCWL supporters and members and society in general must rally behind radical economic transformation. It is now or never.” She says that the league will also push for the revision of the mandate of the South African Reserve Bank.
