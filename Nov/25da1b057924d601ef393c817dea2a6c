                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma has blamed the Democratic Alliance (DA) for his mounting legal fees, a bill being footed by the taxpayer. Zuma’s accused the official opposition of “going to court over everything”. He was asked about the cost of his lengthy court battle over the dropping of the corruption, fraud and racketeering charges against him while answering questions in the National Council of Provinces on Thursday afternoon. President Zuma says it’s unfair of the DA to take him to court and then complain about the size of his legal bill. “Firstly, the matters are in court for such a long time not because of me… I’m not responsible for that I’ve never taken myself to court. Currently, it is the DA that is taking me to court. You can't take me to court and then complain thereafter, it's just unfair.” Zuma says it’s not his problem. “DA goes to court on everything and, therefore, causes the money of the taxpayers to be paid in defence of those who are working in government. It’s your responsibility, not my responsibility.”  Zuma has until the end of the month to make fresh representations to the NPA as why charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering should not be brought against him.  He repeated on Thursday afternoon that he is taking legal advice on this. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
