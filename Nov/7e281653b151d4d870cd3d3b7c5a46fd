                                         PRETORIA - Home Affairs Director-General (DG) Mkuseli Apleni says he is happy to be back at the department, working under newly appointed Minister Ayanda Dlodlo. Former Home Affairs Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize suspended Apleni three months ago but the DG was reinstated after the High Court ruled she was not authorised to do so. A visibly relax Apleni has made his first public address in Pretoria since his suspension from the department. He says he plans to set it aside and continue working. “I ‘m back, I’m happy and we’re happy as a department with the minister and that’s’ all I can say. Everybody is happy.” He says he’s not met with Mkhize since she was redeployed but does not take the suspension to heart. “If there’s work that needs to be done, we’re not taking the work personally. We’re working based on the responsibilities that we have. And if there’s a minister of Home Affairs who is Ayanda Dlodlo, then we work with her.” Apleni says the issue of Home Affairs staff working on Saturdays which is one of the reasons he was suspended, remains unsolved.
