The organisation and Freedom Under Law (FUL) have asked the High Court in Pretoria to set aside Mxolisi Nxasana’s 2015 deal. PRETORIA - Corruption Watch has argued that the R17 million settlement agreement with former prosecutions boss Mxolisi Nxasana was unlawful because there's no provision in law for the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to leave office on such terms. The organisation and Freedom Under Law (FUL) have asked the High Court in Pretoria to set aside Nxasana’s 2015 deal. They've asked that the money be paid back and that Nxasana be reinstated. Corruption Watch advocate Matthew Chaskalson argues that if the National Director of Public Prosecutions resigns from office, he is only entitled to a state pension. He says that there is simply no legal provision for a pay-off, as was the case with Nxasana. "Because it is contrary to the principal of prosecutorial independence to allow the president to get rid of a troublesome NDPP by paying obsecene amounts of public money to make him go away." The matter continues on Tuesday.
