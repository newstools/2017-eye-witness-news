                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) has accused President Jacob Zuma of being the reason for the African National Congress (ANC)'s stalwarts' consultative conference. The ANC's alliance partner used its address on the second day of the conference to lash out at President Zuma, blaming him for much of what many say is the rot in the ANC. The SACPâ€™s Solly Mapaila says President Jacob Zuma has sold out the country. "He has donated our national sovereignty, our national independence to a grouping of individuals." He says the president is largely to blame for the current state of the ANC. "He is presiding over a corrupt state system run by securocrats, who are dealing with anyone that they diffe with, who concoct wrong charges, and who incriminate and fabricate lies about individuals who do not agree with them." Zuma has also been accused of undermining the ANC led alliance. WATCH: Mapaila: SACP regrets supporting Zuma
