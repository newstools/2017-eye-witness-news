                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe’s Solidarity Forum say that while the nation is celebrating a new political era in the country, there are still hard realties which need to be faced and that the real work starts now.  The forum held a briefing with representatives from various organisations to discuss the unfolding political developments in Zimbabwe on Wednesday.  Human rights activist Venetia Govender says: “I want to say to Zimbabweans, in a diaspora, the next stage is the most difficult stage but I think as South Africans, we pledge to be there as constant solidarity partners.” Emmerson Mnangagwa has pledged to put Zimbabweans first ahead of his inauguration in a week that's seen the end of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe’s time at the helm. Zimbabweans who gathered to welcome Mnangagwa home after a brief stint in exile have labelled Mugabe’s government a dictatorship. The president in-waiting addressed a large crowd outside the Zanu-PF headquarters in Harare last night just hours after landing in the country. WATCH: Mnangagwa: I pledge myself to be your servant
