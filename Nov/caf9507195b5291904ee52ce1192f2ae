                                         PRETORIA - President Jacob Zuma has described the Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria as the “best facility in the world” during his visit on Friday afternoon. The president has interacted with patients during a walkabout at the hospital. The Steve Biko Academic Hospital has recently been rated the best well-managed hospital in the country by the office of health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba.  President Zuma, who was welcomed with open arms by patients, says he is happy with what he’s seen. “In fact, I can tell you I wanted to ask for a bed and be checked in. If I was a journalist I’d even exaggerate and say it’s one of the best in the world, let them correct me.” Zuma says all South Africans should be proud. “This is one of our success story as a country.” The president was accompanied by Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa.
