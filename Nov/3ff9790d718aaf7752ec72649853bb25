                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape tourism industry  is expecting a busy season, despite concerns over the water crisis. The province is experiencing its worse drought in more than a hundred years. The City of Cape Town is implementing tight water restrictions and is establishing new water sources. Wesgro CEO Tim Harris says that the tourism sector is expecting a bumper season. But the industry is also concerned about water conservation. “Our message is very clear. We are anticipating a bumper tourist season in the Cape. We believe that it’s entirely possible to be a water-wise destination and a strong growing tourist destination.” Airbnb, Cape Nature and the Western Cape government have announced plans to save 70 million litres of water a year through the distribution of 2,300 low-flow shower heads to guesthouses, B&B's and Airbnb hosts across the province. Last year, international tourists contributed over R38 billion to the Cape economy and close to 320,000 jobs were created.
