                                         JOHANNESBURG - SABC board member John Mattison says none of those considered for top positions at the SABC have been vetted. The SABC board held an urgent briefing on Thursday after Rachel Kalidass resigned. In a letter to President Jacob Zuma, Kalidaas requested that she be released from her duties with immediate effect, raising concerns about the appointment process for the positions of group CEO and COO for the public broadcaster. The board says her conduct breached confidentiality. Mattison says Kalidaas should have voiced her concerns. “I had a series of three or four different emails in which I asked her to give us her concerns in writing. As we asked other people, other people gave their concerns in writing, but she never did. And the next thing I see is in the press that she has resigned.” View the full resignation letter below: Rachel Kalidass Resignation by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd.
