                                         CAPE TOWN/JOHANNESBURG - With Black Friday festivities continuing in malls and shopping centres, Pick n Pay management at the Pan Africa Mall say they are disappointed with the turnout of customers at their store. Like many other stores, Pick n Pay has put a number of their items on sale for the day, but management says they haven't attracted as much foot traffic as anticipated. Pan Africa Mall stores have multiple Black Friday discount offers - from furniture, food to fashion. However, it seems they have not attracted as much customers on Friday as they had hoped for. Manager at Pick’n Pay Philani Zindela says it seems many of their fresh produce items will go to waste. “It’s not expected like we did last year, we overbought some of the stuff because we thought we might be wiped out, unfortunately.” Head office representative Francois Diener says the purchases are representative of their conservative market.

The store opened its doors at 6am to a crowd of people. Branch Manager Waynne Rosenberg says: “Normally we get busier later in the day. The staff are all here and ready to go.” A Manenberg woman had mixed feelings about her shopping experience. “There was no queue, last year we had to stand in a queue. The specials were not that great either, you’d find a special here and there.” Another woman left her Grassy Park home at the break of dawn to get some good deals. “I think it was fantastic at Canal Walk, it was much better than last year. There were no queues at all.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
