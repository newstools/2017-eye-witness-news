                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) says it does not find that Oscar Pistorius is genuinely remorseful for killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.  The court on Friday morning overturned a six-year sentence handed down by the High Court in Pretoria and replaced it with a sentence of 13 years and five months.  The Blade Runner shot and killed Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day 2013.  In a scathing judgment, written by Judge Willie Seriti, the SCA says a six-year sentence is “shockingly” lenient to the point of trivialising the crime. It says Pistorius failed to take the court into his confidence and apologising to Steenkamp’s family does not show he is genuinely remorseful. Seriti says he found no reason to not give Pistorius the prescribed minimum sentence. “This court determined the respondent, Mr Pistorius, should have been sentenced to 15 years imprisonment but took into account the sentence he served prior to being sentenced on 6 July 2015.” The judgment by the SCA was unanimous.
