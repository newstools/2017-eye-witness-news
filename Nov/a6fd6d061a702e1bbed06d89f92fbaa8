                                         CAPE TOWN - With the festive season upon us beach goers have been advised to be safe when they visit the coast line. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) is launching an emergency floatation campaign using Pink Torpedo buoys. Last year, 2,000 people died due to fatal drownings in country and 20,000 non-fatal drownings in the same year. These brightly coloured rescue devises will help lifeguards during the hot summer months as they make it easy to spot people who might be in distress. The NSRI'S Andrew Ingram said, “We are asking people not to go into the water to save someone but to rather throw the torpedo buoy into the water and call the emergency numbers for help.”
