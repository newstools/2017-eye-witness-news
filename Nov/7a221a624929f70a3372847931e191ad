                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says 2017 will be remembered as the year in which the African National Congress (ANC) lost the last of its legitimacy due to chronic mismanagement and corruption. Reflecting on the year in Parliament, the official opposition says it's been one characterised by President Jacob Zuma displaying arrogance in the House, while the presiding officers have protected him from accounting fully to the legislature. The DA says all the crises that Parliament had to deal with this year, were generated by the ANC… a party at war with itself. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen says it's been one of the worst years for passing new legislation since 1994. “There's been a lot of dragging of the feet and failure to do Parliament's job properly in other sections. Clearly, Home Affairs not dealing with the issue of state capture properly, Mineral Resources and Transport also not dealing with it properly.” However, the official opposition says there have been highlights, including the work done by the SABC and Eskom inquiries, and the handling of the social grants crisis. The DA also counts its motion of no confidence in the president as a feather in its cap after 177 MPs voted in favour of it.
