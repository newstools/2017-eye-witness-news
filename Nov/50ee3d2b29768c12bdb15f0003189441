                                         TOKYO - Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp said on Tuesday that it was considering investing in Uber Technologies Inc. but there was no final agreement at this stage. “If conditions on share price and a minimum of shares are not satisfactory for the SoftBank Group side, there is a possibility the SoftBank Group may not make an investment,” it said in a statement. Uber said earlier this week that a planned deal with SoftBank and Dragoneer Investment Group was moving forward.  The investment could be worth up to $10 billion, two people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.
