                                         CAPE TOWN - The Atlantis Aquifer has been revamped to produce an additional five million litres of water per day. The City of Cape Town has been refurbishing boreholes around the West Coast area to increase the production of this plant.  Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille on Thursday visited the plant that had been producing about four million litres of water per day before the upgrade. “I’m very excited about the work we are doing here. People will say we have no water, but we have water running here. We will be able to supply, and we have a plan. The aquifer is one of the plans.” Homes and industrial areas in Atlantis, Mamre and Pella, rely on the water from this plant. De Lille adds that this additional capacity could see Atlantis becoming self-sufficient. “Atlantis will be able to go off the city’s grid once it becomes self-sufficient.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
