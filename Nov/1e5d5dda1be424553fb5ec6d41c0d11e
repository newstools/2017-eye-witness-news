                                         CAPE TOWN - The Port Elizabeth High Court is expected to hand down judgment in the trial of murder accused Christopher Panayiotou and two men on Thursday. The businessman allegedly orchestrated the murder of his wife, Jayde Panayiotou, in April 2015. Her body was found on the outskirts of Uitenhage a day after she was kidnapped. The defence concluded its closing arguments on Tuesday, giving reasons why it believes that the State's case is flawed. Lawyers for Panayiotou's co-accused, Sinethemba Nenembe, and Zolani Sibeko argued the State has relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and speculation. Meanwhile, advocate Terry Price, who’s representing Panayiotou, told the court there are aspects of the prosecution's case that are inaccurate and misleading. The prosecution argues Jayde Panayiotou’s murder was a contract killing ordered by her husband. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
