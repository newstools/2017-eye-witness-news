                                         JOHANNESBURG - Anglo-South African financial services group Old Mutual said on Wednesday it will retain a 19.9% strategic minority shareholding in Nedbank after the parent companyâ€™s planned split. Old Mutual, whose primary share listing is on the London Stock Exchange, is planning to break itself up into four parts as it says regulatory changes make the company too complex to run in its current form. The shareholding in Nedbank, which is a majority-owned banking subsidiary of Old Mutual plc, will have a primary listing on the JSE and a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange, the companies said in a statement.
