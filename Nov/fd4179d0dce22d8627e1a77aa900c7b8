                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court has on Monday dealt with evidence relating to family axe murder accused Henri van Breda's epilepsy. The defence's sixth witness, a neurologist, Doctor James Butler, has testified on Van Breda's symptoms when he was admitted to hospital following a seizure earlier this month. The 23-year-old is accused of killing his parents and older brother and the attempted murder of his younger sister in their Stellenbosch home in 2015. Doctor James Butler has testified Van Breda's EEG test results show signs of a strong presence of epilepsy. Butler says he asked Van Breda about the night of the attack focusing on the time frame during which the accused claims he blacked out. The doctor has also testified that a photo of Van Breda taken in an ambulance on the morning after the attack reveals dark rings under his eyes and a bruise on his left eye. He says this is consistent with someone recovering from a seizure. Hospital video footage of the sleeping 23-year-old was also shared with the court.
