                                         LONDON - Aldermore Group and South African lender FirstRand said they had agreed on a $1.31 billion takeover of the British bank. The 313 pence offer represents a 22.3% premium to Aldermore’s closing share price of 245 pence on 12 October, the day before the companies announced they were in talks. Aldermore is among a group of so-called “challenger” banks that emerged after the financial crisis to fill a gap in small business lending and capitalise on problems at bigger lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. Aldermore also reported higher nine-month new lending at £2.4 billion, citing strong demand from small and medium sized businesses, homeowners and landlords. JPMorgan, RBC Capital Markets and Lazard are advising the British company.
