The main pipe burst 35 metres underground on Monday, resulting in the largest repair work the city has ever had to carry out. JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Water says a burst pipe which resulted in water cuts in the Sandton area should be repaired by 1pm, provided there are no further complications. This means water may be restored by Wednesday afternoon, however, the utility says residents will have to allow time for reservoirs to fill up. The main pipe burst 35 metres underground on Monday, resulting in the largest repair work the city has ever had to carry out. Affected areas include Bryanston, Woodmead, Morningside, Alexandra and Linbro Park. The utility's Isaac Dhludhlu says high-lying areas like Bryanston will take longer to receive water. “Once the system has been flushed we will then open the water to seal the reservoirs first because the reservoirs are all empty now. We should then be able to open the water to all areas affected.”
