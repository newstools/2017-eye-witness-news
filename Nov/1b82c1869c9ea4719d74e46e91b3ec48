                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Kwazulu-Natal Cooperative Governance Department says it has dispatched disaster management teams to provide assistance to a family that lost three of its members as a result of a heavy storm that has hit the province. A man, his pregnant wife and their three-year-old child died when a wall collapsed over their shack due to heavy wind and downpours in their KwaMashu informal settlement on Saturday. MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube says she is saddened by the incident and warned residents not to cross rivers or swollen streams.  The department's Lennox Mabaso says: “Indeed this is a sad situation. Our condolences go out to this family. Our teams have been doing everything possible to assist the family during their time of need.”  The coastal, central and northern parts of the province are the hardest hit areas following yesterday’s storm. This brings to a total of 19 people who have died as a result of severe storm since last month, where 16 people were killed and property and infrastructure estimated at nearly R2 billion were damage.
