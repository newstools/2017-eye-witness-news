                                         CAPE TOWN - Mayor Patricia de Lille has responded to allegations of corruption levelled against her by an executive director in her office. She says the claims are a malicious attempt to attack her integrity and track record and as a whistleblower and corruption fighter. The issue came before a secret full council meeting on Tuesday and has led to three senior executives, including the city manager, now facing suspension. De Lille says the allegations by Craig Kesson that she's turned a blind eye to corruption, particularly in the transport authority, are sensationalist. “I challenge those who seek to attack my track record to bring any proof that I benefited personally from any corruption or tenders. My lawyers are preparing a comprehensive response to the allegations against me and it will be made available to the media when it is completed.” The mayor is facing a barrage of claims that she's repeatedly tried to quash allegations of corruption involving the city's transport commissioner, Melissa Whitehead. But she says she's undeterred by sensational claims to smear her name. “I will not be distracted by these attempts to discredit my reputation as a corruption fighter.” Meanwhile, De Lille has been given 10 days by a Democratic Alliance sub-committee to provide responses to other allegations related to a public fallout with Mayco member JP Smith.
