                                         JOHANNESBURG - Renowned businessman Richard Branson has given his blessing to a centre for entrepreneurs that was launched in Bryanston in Johannesburg on Friday. 22 on Sloane was opened to coincide with Global Entrepreneurship Week. The campus will assist people in business and aspiring entrepreneurs with training and mentorship. Branson says its pleasing to see entrepreneurship grow in the country. “Every big business in this world was started by an entrepreneur. And small businesses are the ones creating the jobs, innovating and making life better for everybody. So, we’re no longer a rare breed.” Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu were also in attendance. Zulu says the only way to fight poverty and unemployment in the country is to support small businesses. She says the next step is to ensure the campus does not shut down “We can’t afford to let this fail because people that need to be serviced by this campus are the most important people in the economic space of South Africa. The improvement of the economy of South Africa will depend very much on your small and medium enterprises.”
