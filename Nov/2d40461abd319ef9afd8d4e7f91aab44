                                         JOHANNESBURG - Economic Development MEC Lebogang Maile  says the High Court’s ruling to extend the permits of shebeen owners will cause an administrative nightmare for the Gauteng Liquor Board, as well as see shebeens that don’t comply with the licensing regulations able to run until 2019 Last week the Johannesburg High Court ruled that shebeen permit holders are eligible to trade for the next two years on their existing permits. However, MEC Maile says this has created a huge task for the Gauteng Liquor Board to review some parts of the liquor licensing regulations. He says the board will be seeking legal advice on whether to appeal the judgement. “It means everybody who’s got a permit must now get a license. The unfortunate thing is that some of the people with permits don’t’ necessarily qualify because, for instance, they are selling alcohol 500m from schools, 500m from churches and the law prohibits that.”
