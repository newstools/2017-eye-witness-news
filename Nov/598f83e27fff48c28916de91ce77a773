The Class of 2017 has now entered the fourth week of exams. On Tuesday, more than 10,000 candidates wrote economics paper two, while just under 100 matriculants completed their Sesotho home language paper. Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer says the exams have run smoothly so far. “For some the first half of the examination has been a tough one, with many of the popular subjects being written such as mathematics, history, geography and physical science. To all the candidates; well done on coming this far.” LISTEN: Keep calm: Tips to help your kids prepare for exams  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
