                                         HARARE - President Robert Mugabe  has made his first public comments on the sacking of his vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. He says his former second in command is deviant and needs to go back to ideology school. This was said in an address to a huge crowd of supporters at the ruling party’s headquarters in Harare. Mugabe compared Mnangagwa to former vice president Joice Mujuru, who was sacked three years ago for allegedly plotting to take over from him. According to quotes carried by the state-run Herald online, Mugabe said Mnangagwa is deviant and lacks the discipline needed to be a leader. He suggested the veteran nationalist be retrained in party ideology. There have been calls on Wednesday by some officials to now purge the ruling Zanu-PF, as well as government departments and state-run firms of all those perceived to be loyal to Mnangagwa.
