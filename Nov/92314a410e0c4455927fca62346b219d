                                         JOHANNESBURG - Harmony Gold  says it will confirm on Tuesday afternoon if all employees at the Kusasalethu  mine in Carletonville have returned to work, following a deal to end the stay away. Workers embarked on a wildcat strike last week Friday in protest over the sacking of six Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) branch leaders over several cases of illegal demonstrations this year. The mining company's Lauren Fourie says an agreement was reached with Amcu for workers to report to work from Monday night. “Hopefully the night shift employees start presenting themselves for work and then we’ve got the morning shift thereafter and then we can then probably confirm once maybe the morning shift or the afternoon shift is done where numbers have stabilised and we’ve started production again.” At the same time, the mine says it will investigate allegations of violence and intimidation of some workers during the strike.
