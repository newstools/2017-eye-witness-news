                                         CAPE TOWN - Murder accused Henri van Breda's legal team is likely to link his recent seizure to his claim of blacking out on the night of the attack. Van Breda has been diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy after suffering a seizure last week. The case has been postponed to 27 November when a neurologist and psychologist will be testifying for the defence. The defence is expected to call up a neurologist to testify on the accused’s condition, called juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The doctor will also testify on what could've led to his blacking out for two hours and 45 minutes on the night of the attack. Wits University neurology professor, Girish Modi, explains that someone with this condition usually experiences seizures before they wake up. “Actual epilepsy is different to what we know as epilepsy. This is a case where your whole body jumps.” Modi says it usually occurs in the teenage years, but can also only surface in adulthood, although this is uncommon. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
