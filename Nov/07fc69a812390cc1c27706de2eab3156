                                         CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has released its public safety operational plan for the holiday season. The initiative involves roadblocks, roaming vehicle checkpoints and increased law enforcement at public spaces. Road and beach safety are two of the main focus areas. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said: “This time of the year is known as the silly season and sadly the silliness of some can have devastating consequences for themselves and others. I’m particularly concerned about the behaviour on our beaches as it relates to alcohol abuse, drowning incidents and missing children.”  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
