                                         JOHANNESBURG - Bafana Bafana ended their World Cup 2018 qualifying campaign with a 2-1 defeat to Senegal in Dakar on Tuesday night.  South Africa started the brighter of the two sides, creating plenty of scoring opportunities through the pace of Sundowns duo, Percy Tau and Sibusiso Vilakazi.  Vilakazi had arguably the best chance of the half when he was brilliantly set up by Tau, but a fine athletic save from goalkeeper Alfred Gomis in the 37th minute denied South Africa from taking the lead.   Bafana were made to rue that missed opportunity, early into the second half, when an Itumeleng Khune’s misjudgement, allowed Opa Nguette to give Senegal the lead with a well-executed chip. Themba Zwane was given the opportunity to equalize from the penalty spot, after Senegal defender Youssouf Sabaly made a clumsy challenge in the box, but Zwane sent his effort wide of the goal.  Tau made sure that South Africa didn’t rue that missed chance, when he finished off a sweeping counter attack in the 65th minute, pulling one back for the visiting South Africans.  Kara Mbodji’s stoppage time header, though, ensured that Senegal made it two consecutive victories over Bafana Bafana. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
