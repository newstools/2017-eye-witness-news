                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma  has denied the existence of state capture. In an interview aired on ANN7, he has described it as a fake political tool.  Zuma is accused of orchestrating and allowing undue influence of state-owned entities by the Guptas. Zuma wants to know what people mean by state capture. “They can’t just make it sound so important and big, this state capture.” He says that the commission of inquiry that he will established will be tasked with answering this question. “What is a state capture? I am sure very keen to know.” The president believes the term was created for this reason. “It’s all fake and political, just to paint black a particular family and individuals.” He says those who talk about the state capture inquiry for political reasons will regret it. “They might regret, in fact, they will regret. That’s the point I’ve made because it’s not going to be choosy. It’s going to go to those who have done wrong things.” He says he has fought corruption, adding that if he is corrupt, the commission will expose him too. On Monday night his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, spoke about state capture. He believes that it has a negative impact on the economy. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
