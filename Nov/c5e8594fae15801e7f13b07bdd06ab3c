                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority in South Africa - or PSiRA - says that a message circulating on WhatsApp and other social media platforms stating that its members will embark on a mass strike on Thursday are untrue.  The regulatory authority says that the messages were spread by its own members, who are disgruntled and were simply trying to scare the public. PSiRA management says that it has now met with the security guards, who have agreed to stop spreading the false message. CEO Manabele Chauke says tomorrow's march has been called off and was never authorised in the first place. “They have met with us and brought several complaints that they have and we were able to articulate how we intend to resolve some of the complaints.  “They have undertaken to call off the marches, they were illegal in the first place as there was no permission to have those marches.” The voicenote said that security guards would shut down all the country’s airports, train stations and malls and that there would be attacks on foreign nationals.
