                                         JOHANNESBURG - Cellphone service provider MTN says the bulk of users who experienced signal and data problems on Thursday morning have now been resolved. Network problems occurred in parts of the country after an overnight upgrade to its system failed. However, some users are still experiencing glitches. MTN Spokesperson Jacqui O'sullivan says technicians hope to resolve all problems soon. “Many of the customers that were affected from about 6am this morning are already back up and running and we are redirecting traffic away from the two faulty nodes just to further limit the impact on our customers while we finalise the repairs.”
