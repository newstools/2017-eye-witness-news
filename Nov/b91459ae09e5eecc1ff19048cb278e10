                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) has confirmed it will be scrapping debt of more than R3 billion in unpaid e-tolls. Sanral says it will write off R3.6 billion for the current financial year but will continue attempts to recover unpaid e-tolls by taking defaulters to court. Sanral says e-toll debt older than three years will also be scrapped. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says four out of five motorists aren't paying e-tolls, and the scheme is simply not working. Outa's Wayne Duvenage said: “We believe they’ve written down the punitive tolls down to normal e-tag toll rates and they’ve kept it for the three years and then they ignored all those under R500. That is the first chance of cleaning out, but it is a realisation and acknowledgement ‘that all the charges that we have been charging the public out there are not collectable, we need to start removing it from our books’.”
