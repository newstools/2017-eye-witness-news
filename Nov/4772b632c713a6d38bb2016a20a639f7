                                         JOHANNESBURG - Proteas fast bowler, Dale Steyn is set to return to action in the Titansâ€™ T20 Challenge  clash against the Knights in Kimberly on Wednesday night. Steyn, who fractured his shoulder on the tour of Australia in November 2016, and has missed more than a year of cricket, will be raring to go on his return to action. Steyn has put off his return to the field numerous times at the beginning of the season, citing reasons that he was not feeling 100% ready to compete in a competitive match. The 417-Test match wicket-taker will be aiming for an international comeback when India and Australia visit South Africa, in a jam-packed summer of cricket. The Titans and Knights game will start at 6pm on Wednesday evening.
