                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma has defended National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abraham's fitness to hold office. The presidency yesterday issued Zuma's responses to questions submitted by the Democratic Alliance (DA), Cope and the Economic Freedom Fighters. Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota wanted to know if Zuma intended suspending Abrahams and taking action against him based on criticism levelled in a recent supreme court of appeal judgment. The court last month dismissed an appeal by Zuma and the NPA of the high court judgment that declared invalid the decision to drop corruption, fraud and racketeering charges against him. The president says it would be “irrational and unconstitutional” for him to suspend the NPA based on the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment. The court criticised the way the prosecuting authority sought to justify the 2009 decision to drop charges against Zuma. He says nothing in the judgment suggests Abrahams is not a fit and proper person to be the national director of public prosecutions. Zuma has until the end of this month to make representations to the NPA as to why the charges should not be reinstated. Replying to a question from DA leader Mmusi Maimane, Zuma says he is taking legal advice on the matter. (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
