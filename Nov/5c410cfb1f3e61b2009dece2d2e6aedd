                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has been removed as the head of Zanu-PF. Axed vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa has also been reinstated. The party has also recalled Mugabe from his position as president and vice secretary. He has been given until Monday afternoon to hand in his resignation. Mugabe fired Mnangagwa earlier this month, apparently to make room for his wife, Grace, to succeed him. However, the Zimbabwean Defense Force reacted by taking over government, accusing Mugabe of purging military vets. A special central committee session is currently taking place at the Zanu-PF party headquarters in Harare to discuss the axing of President Robert Mugabe. While the media has been asked to step out of the meeting, sounds of jubilation broke inside the hall. An official announcement hasn't been made yet but military veteranâ€™s Christopher Mutsvangwa says that Mugabe is no longer president. Local media is reporting that Emmerson Mnangagwa is back in the country after he fled for his life.
