                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy Basic Education Minister Enver Surty has told lawmakers that a proposed new bill will clear up any confusion about who has the final say in determining a public school’s admission policy. Critics of the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill have likened it to “nationalising” schools by stripping governing bodies and parents of their decision-making powers. The draft bill says the Head of Department has the final authority to admit a pupil and approve a school’s language policy. Surty told Parliament’s Basic Education Portfolio Committee that the proposed amendments must be seen in the context of social justice. “If at all there’s going to be an argument about the fact that we cannot basically make any determination about policy in terms of language, religion or race. I’m going to say no, we’re going to make that determination.” Perhaps the most controversial clause in the draft Bill limits the power of a governing body to make senior appointments such as choosing the school’s principal. Committee chairperson Nomalungelo Gina has acknowledged sharp resistance to this proposal. “We definitely agree that there are clauses that are quite controversial, more especially the one on School Governing Bodies.” The draft bill also requires schools to consider different religious and cultural beliefs when crafting their codes of conduct so that pupils aren’t unfairly disciplined for their hairstyles or how they dress. The department has extended the deadline for public comment to 10 January. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
