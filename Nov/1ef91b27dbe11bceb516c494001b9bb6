                                         JOHANNESBURG - The case against a school guard accused of sexually assaulting over 80 pupils at a Soweto primary has been postponed to next month for further investigation. The 57-year-old man made a brief appearance in the Protea Magistrates Court on Thursday. He was arrested last month after some parents laid a complaint with the police. The scholar patrolman has been charged with several counts of rape and sexual abuse. The Gauteng Education Department's Steve Mabona says pupils at the affected school continue to receive counselling. “We’re working very closely with the investigative team and the prosecution, and we’re monitoring the situation very closely.” WATCH: Parents of school sex assault victims: Department not assisting us
