The 'Kill Bill' actress previously said she was too 'angry' to express her thoughts about the disgraced producer. LOS ANGELES - Uma Thurman has wished a Happy Thanksgiving to "everyone" apart from disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein. The Kill Bill actress previously said she was too "angry" to express her thoughts about the disgraced producer - who worked on several of her movies - and other high-profile figures who have been accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour. She has now used the holiday to praise the "courage" of those who have spoken forward and take a swipe at the movie mogul, who has been accused of harassment and even rape by a number of women. And Thurman also suggested she had been a victim of unwanted sexual advances by using the hashtag #metoo in her post, which has previously been used by women to tell their own experiences of misconduct. She wrote: "H A P P Y T H A N K S G I V I N G "I am grateful today, to be alive, for all those I love, and for all those who have the courage to stand up for others. "I said I was angry recently, and I have a few reasons, #metoo, in case you couldn't tell by the look on my face. "I feel it's important to take your time, be fair, be exact, so... Happy Thanksgiving Everyone! (Except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators - I'm glad it's going slowly - you don't deserve a bullet) -stay tuned (sic)"  The Gattaca actress - who has Maya, 19, and Levon, 15, with ex-husband Ethan Hawke and Luna, five, with former partner Arpad Busson - has previously admitted she felt too "angry" to speak about the Hollywood scandal. She said recently: "I don't have a tidy soundbite for you, because I have learned, I am not a child and I have learned that... when I've spoken in anger, I usually regret the way I express myself. "So I've been waiting to feel less angry... and when I'm ready, I'll say what I have to say."
