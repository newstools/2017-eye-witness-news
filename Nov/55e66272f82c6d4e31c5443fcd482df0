                                         JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has hit out at those who attribute every problem the country faces to him, saying that they don’t understand what he calls the balance of forces. Zuma was addressing African National Congress (ANC) supporters in Kagiso on Sunday in what was meant to be a lecture on former ANC President Oliver Tambo. President Zuma made it clear from the beginning that he would not deliver a memorial lecture but talk about politics generally. Speaking in Zulu, he told his supporters that the country is famous for thinking that every problem is caused by him. “Even when someone has lost a shoelace, the problem is Zuma. When there’s a drought, they say it’s because of Zuma.” The president also told his supporters he can’t wait to step down as ANC president in December, saying that will give him the chance to respond to those who talk nonsense about him and the party.
