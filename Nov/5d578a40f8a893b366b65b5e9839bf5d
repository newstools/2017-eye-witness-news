                                         JOHANNESBURG - Major bookselling chain Exclusive Books  says it doesn’t believe its sale and distribution of Jacques Pauw's book The Presidents Keeper's is against the law and will continue to stand behind the author and the publisher. Exclusive Books says its task is to sell books which demonstrate different arguments about matters of importance to the South African public. Pauw's new book contains allegations against President Jacob Zuma relating to corruption and irregularities with his tax affairs. The chain says this book has not committed any offence. CEO of Exclusive Books Benjamin Trisk says it’s up to those who say there's a breach of the law to prove it within the court system. “A matter of common knowledge that once a book is out and has been distributed and interdict against the book is of no force and effect. The option I think for the authorities is to go to court and ask a judge to determine this.”
