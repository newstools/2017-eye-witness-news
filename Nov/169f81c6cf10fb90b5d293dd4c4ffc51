                                         CAPE TOWN - Three suspects arrested for prepaid electricity fraud amounting to almost R600 000 are due back in court next month. The trio made their first appearance in the Bellville Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Friday. They're alleged to have colluded and produced illegal replacement prepaid electricity tokens. They're facing over 1300 counts of fraud. The Hawks Lloyd Ramovha said: “It is alleged that for a period of the year, starting in 2015, the accused who worked at the Drakenstein Municipality in Paarl allegedly sold prepaid electricity for cash to the public at a cheaper rate.”
