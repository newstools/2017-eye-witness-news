                                         JOHANNESBURG - A South African NGO has been granted permission by Bangladeshi authorities to erect 10,000 homes for displaced Rohingya refugees. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled their homes in Myanmar since violence erupted there in August.  The United Nations has called the situation ethnic cleansing. The Al-Imdaad Foundation's Moulana Motala says that the new homes will provide Rohingya refugees with more permanent and comfortable shelter. “We have seen a great need for shelter for these people. This is a long-term crisis. They are not going home, they are here in Bangladesh. We appeal to the South African public to assist.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
