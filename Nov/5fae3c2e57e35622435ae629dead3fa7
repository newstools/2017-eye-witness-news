                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it cannot comment on any nuclear plans as it is not a policymaker but merely an implementing agency. Yesterday, NGO Earthlife Africa marched to the power utility's office in Braamfontein protesting against potential nuclear implementation plans. It’s being claimed that President Jacob Zuma appointed David Mahlobo as energy minister during his latest Cabinet reshuffle in hopes to fast track the nuclear plan before he leaves office in December. Mahlobo has denied this. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba's office has denied reports that he asked the World Bank for funds for Eskom to roll out the nuclear programme. There is growing concern that Mahlobo is reportedly rushing through the process to implement the nuclear energy plan in the next week. Earthlife Africa's Thabo Sibeko said nuclear is dangerous and expensive. “We don’t trust the new energy minister because he is being pushed by those who have a nuclear agenda.” In a response to Eyewitness News' questions, Eskom said the Department of Energy is currently busy with the revision on the integrated resource plan and the integrated energy plan, that will provide the utility with an energy roadmap for the next 20 years.
