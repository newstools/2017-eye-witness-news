                                         CAPE TOWN - Police and specialised unit the Hawks have made abalone busts worth an estimated R10 million in Brackenfell and Caledon in less than a week. In the latest incident, two men will appear in the Caledon magistrates court on Monday after they were caught with more than 67,000 units of abalone over the weekend. A foul smell led to the discovery of abalone and perlemoen cooking and drying equipment at a premises in the Caledon industrial area on Friday. The police’s Frederick van Wyk says that the abalone is valued at R5 million. “Caledon police members received a complaint about the suspicious smell that as coming from the premises and 67,280 units of abalone were seized.” This follows a similar discovery during a raid at a Brackenfell house last week.  The property was being used as an abalone processing facility. Officers found more than 40,000 units of abalone inside the premises also valued at around R5 million.
