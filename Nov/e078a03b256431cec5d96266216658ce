                                         CAPE TOWN - The interim board of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) is expected to explain to Parliament on Tuesday why the agency has not been able to finalise its financial statements for the year. Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi has already written to Speaker Baleka Mbete twice to beg the indulgence of the House.  He is also expected to answer to state capture allegations at Prasa before Parliament’s transport committee, which include the Gupta family’s alleged involvement in a R51 billion tender for trains. In September, Joe Maswanganyi wrote to the Speaker saying that the Auditor-General needed a legal opinion on whether Prasa’s acting chief executive could accept the audit report in the absence of a board. He promised that the documents would be tabled in Parliament by the end of October, a month late. That did not happen, and just over a week ago, he wrote another letter saying that the Auditor-General is still finalising the document. The term of office of the last permanent board ended in July, and an interim board was appointed by Cabinet last month. Parliament’s transport committee chairperson Dikeledi Magadzi says: “There are other things that are outstanding that we believe the new board should be able to assist us around.” The transport committee will also be meeting with the boards of the Air Traffic and Navigation Services and the South African Maritime Safety Authority, both which have also failed to submit audited financials on time.
