                                         PRETORIA - African National Congress (ANC) President Jacob Zuma has arrived ahead of the party’s special NEC meeting at the St Georges hotel in Irene. The national executive members have convened to discuss, among others, feedback from the party’s Veterans League conference and the recent Eastern Cape provincial conference. NEC members are continuing to arrive at the St George’s Hotel for the meeting. That sitting is expected to deliberate on the ANC’s Eastern Cape provincial congress, which was characterised by bloodstained floor tiles, beaten delegates and broken chairs. The 2nd conference of the ANC Veteran’s League which was also held in October is also expected to be under the spotlight. At that conference, some of its members voiced that National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams should exercise independence and reinstate over 700 criminal charges against President Zuma. Those remarks came just after the Supreme Court had dismissed an appeal by the NPA and President Zuma against a High Court order which set aside the decision to withdraw the charges.
