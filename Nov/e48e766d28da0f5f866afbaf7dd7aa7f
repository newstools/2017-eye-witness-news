The move comes less then a week after Treasury confirmed his resignation from the department. According to a statement issued by the Gauteng provincial government, Premier David Makhura requested that Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba facilitate the lateral transfer of Michael Sachs from Treasury to the provincial government. Sachs will join the premier's office as the deputy Director-General responsible for Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. "I would like to use the skills of Michael Sachs to immediately help to stabilise the finances of the Gauteng Department of Health, which poses a major risk at the moment. He will thereafter focus on monitoring and fast tracking spending on infrastructure budgets of the Gauteng Departments and Municipalities," Makhura said in a statement.
