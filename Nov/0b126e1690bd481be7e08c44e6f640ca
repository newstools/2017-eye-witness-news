                                         JOHANNESBURG - South African Super Rugby sides, the Stormers and the Bulls, are scheduled to play a Super Rugby preseason game in Los Angeles, California on 3 February 2018. The match will be played as a curtain raiser for the clash between the USA Eagles and an Argentina XV at Stub Hub Center, which forms part of the Americas Rugby Championship. This will be the first time that Super Rugby sides will be playing in the United States, and Western Province Rugby Group CEO, Paul Zacks, says that the match presents a great opportunity to promote the union's brand, and help grow the game.  “This is a great opportunity to share the success of the DHL Stormers team and brand with a new and growing market.”
