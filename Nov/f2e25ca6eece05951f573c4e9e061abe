                                         CAPE TOWN - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the African National Congress (ANC) Members of Parliament (MPs) who went against their chief whip Jackson Mthembu displayed “great ill-discipline.” Speaking to journalists in Parliament on Thursday, Ramaphosa shared his views on Eskom, Parliament’s state capture inquiry and the ANC’s upcoming elective conference. Ramaphosa takes a dim view of the handful of ANC MPs who publicly attacked Jackson Mthembu. “To have gone on an attack against the chief whip issued a statement is a great sign of ill-discipline and the matter is being discussed and looked at.” The MPs broke ranks by holding a press conference in which they accused Mthembu of siding with the DA on the scheduling of a debate on state capture in the National Assembly this week. Ramaphosa says the MPs should have raised their concerns within the party.
