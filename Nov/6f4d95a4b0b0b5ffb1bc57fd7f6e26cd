                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has once again extended the deadline for the party’s branches to finish their meetings and submit nominations for the leadership race next month. The initial deadline lapsed last week. And secretary-general Gwede Mantashe extended the grace period to this past Sunday.  ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says the branches have until this weekend to make their submissions. “There is still a number of branches that may want to convene other meetings for one reason or another.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
