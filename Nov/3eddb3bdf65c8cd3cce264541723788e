                                         JOHANNESBURG- The Cape Cobras moved up to second in the T20 Challenge log after a 10-run victory over the Warriors at Boland Park on Wednesday night.  The Cobras got off to a fast start, with openers Hashim Amla and Temba Bavuma punishing any errors in line and length from the Warriors bowlers. Amla recorded his second half century of the competition and his 27th in T20 cricket, while left arm spinner, George Linde was promoted up the order, and scored a blistering 52 off 30 deliveries to help the Cobras post a competitive 159 for 4 in their 20 overs. The Warriors' innings stuttered, and failed to gain any considerable momentum in the run chase. The two Colinâ€™s, Ingram and Ackerman gave the Warriors some hope with a good partnership, but the Cobras continued to pick up wickets at crucial times to stem the Warriors momentum. The Warriors eventually fell 10 runs short of the winning target. The result sees the Cobras move up to second on the log behind the leaders the Titans, while the Warriors remain rooted to the bottom of the log.  The derby between the Lions and the Titans ended before it even began, when play was abandoned without a ball being bowled. The two teams shared the points. The next round of T20 Challenge action is on Friday, with the Cobras taking on the Dolphins in Durban, the Knights welcome the Lions in Bloemfontein and the Warriors are away to the Titans in Benoni.
