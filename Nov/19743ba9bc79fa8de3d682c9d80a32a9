                                         JOHANNESBURG - As Zimbabweans continue to celebrate Robert Mugabe’s resignation, some say that they hope this means next year’s elections will be free and fair. The Zimbabwean embassy in Pretoria seemed to be closed for business on Wednesday with no movement in or out of the property and no security guards manning the gates. While it was fairly quiet at the Zimbabwean embassy, a small group of Zimbabwean political activists visited the embassy only to find it closed. Zanu-PF member and convener in the Western Cape, Gift Nihikiti says that he still believes Mugabe’s good acts surpass the bad. “Yes mistakes were done but the mistake can’t overshadow the good that President Mugabe did. Surely the Zimbabweans, wherever they are, are proud to be Zimbabwean just because of the quality of education they got from Zimbabwe.” WATCH: Mnangagwa: I pledge myself to be your servant  However, opposition party Movement for Democratic Change's Dr Timashe Mawere says that Mugabe’s departure is not going to be enough to fix Zimbabwe’s problems. “Let’s also go home and register to vote and when the time comes for voting, let us all go and vote for the Zimbabwe we have been hoping for.” At the same time, President Jacob Zuma met with the incoming president Emmerson Mnangagwa in Pretoria on Wednesday and paid him a courtesy call prior to arriving in Zimbabwe.
