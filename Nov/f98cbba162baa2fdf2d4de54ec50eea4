                                         JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has been criticised by protesters who marched to the Union Buildings against farm murders on Saturday. Duncan Prinsloo is a victim of a farm attack and says Malema is playing a big part in the crisis by telling young people to kill farmers. WATCH: A farm attack victim's message to Malema  Prinsloo from Bronkhorstspruit lost his wife in a farm attack in 2008. Prinsloo was shot in the back during the attack. He says Malema is an instigator in the farm murder crisis in south Africa and challenged him to come finish the job they began. “I want to challenge him today, I don’t mind dying. He can come and finish what they didn’t finish. Let’s see if he has guts to do what he teaches the youngsters.” Prinsloo says he is proud to be South African when he sees the people stand together against farm murders. Meanwhile, opposition parties have spoken out about farm murders, calling on government to take action. Members of Congress of the People (Cope), Democratic Alliance and Freedom Front Plus joined AfriForum in a march. Cope's Mosiuoa Lekota marched in front of the big crowd holding a banner saying, 'stop killing our farmers'. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
