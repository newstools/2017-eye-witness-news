                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma will this afternoon be asked about allegations that he received a monthly R1 million payment from a private company after he became president of the country. The Speaker’s office has agreed to allow an urgent question on the matter to be included in Zuma’s oral reply session this afternoon. The Democratic Alliance (DA) made the request on Wednesday in terms of rule 141 of the National Assembly, which allows for an urgent question to be put on the order paper. The question relates to allegations in Jacques Pauw’s book, The President’s Keepers, which alleges the president was on the payroll of a company owned by a friend and ANC benefactor for a number of months after he became head of state. The DA argued for the question be included on Thursday, because it is Zuma’s last oral reply session for this year. The party is asking Zuma to say whether or not he received any payments from Roy Moodley, or his company Royal Security, at any time since becoming president in May 2009. Zuma’s also expected to shed light on the legal fees racked up by the Presidency in his lengthy legal battle over the National Prosecuting Authority’s decision to drop fraud, corruption and racketeering charges against him, a decision that has since been declared irrational.
