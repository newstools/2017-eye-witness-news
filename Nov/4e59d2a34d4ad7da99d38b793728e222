                                         DURBAN - South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Blade Nzimande maintains the communist party has not declared a preferred candidate for the African National Congress (ANC)’s presidential race but hopes whoever is elected will show respect for the alliance partners. Nzimande was speaking at Red October celebrations in Clermont where a commemoration rally for the Russian revolution was held. It was the former higher education minister’s first public address since being axed from Cabinet a few weeks ago. Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has on the other hand already declared Cyril Ramaphosa as their preferred candidate and have been campaigning for him nationwide. Nzimande has wished the ANC well ahead of its elective conference. “All that we’re hoping for is for the ANC to emerge more united and also we want an ANC leadership that is prepared to listen when we raise the issue of the reconfiguration of the alliance.”
