                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom appears to be desperate to blame and get rid of its legal head for its dealings with Gupta-linked Trillian. Eyewitness News can reveal that the power utility issued Suzanne Daniels with two completely different charge sheets last month to motivate her suspension.  Daniels’ internal report handed to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, explains Eskom’s relationship with Gupta-linked Trillian and consultancy firm McKinsey and implicates several executives, including suspended Matshela Koko and Anoj Singh. A damning internal report compiled by Daniels, details how several executives went out of their way to ensure that Trillian was paid for little or no work when it was dealing with McKinsey. It also shows how Eskom ignored legal advice more than once about entering into the contract with McKinsey. The report was handed to Brown, who hasn’t yet commented on the extent of the information, but Daniels is now the person Eskom wants to get rid of. When former CEO Johnny Dladla handed her a letter of intention to suspend her in early October, she responded to the allegations, saying that there’s no basis for the suspension. Then on the same day that Sean Maritz was appointed as CEO, a new charge sheet was drafted and issued to Daniels, stating that she’s facing charges of misconduct for not informing the board about the liability in terms of paying McKinsey and Trillian. Daniels is going to the CCMA on Tuesday to fight her suspension. Eskom says it will oppose the lifting of the suspension at the CCMA and the initial charge sheet indicated that further charges could be added.
