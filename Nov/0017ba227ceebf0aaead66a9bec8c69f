                                         JOHANNESBURG – A man is expected to appear before the Lehurutse Magistrates Court on Friday for the murder of his four-month-old child. Police arrived at the scene on a farm near Lehurutse after they received a call from the local Emergency Medical Services on Wednesday. Upon questioning, the mother of the child revealed that she had fled from the home on Saturday following a fight with her partner. She says she was unable to take the child with her when she ran to seek help from neighbours. The mother says when she returned that same evening she noticed the child had been assaulted. In a written statement police said: “According to information available at this stage, the father further assaulted the baby in the morning on Wednesday, 8 November 2017. Upon noticing that the baby was dead, the suspect instructed the mother to take him back to her place in Willowpark Farm.” When emergency personnel were called to the scene nothing could be done for the baby who was declared dead. North West provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane said they are saddened by the incident which occurred within a few days before the commencement of 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children.
