                                         JOHANNESBURG - Energy Minister David Mahlobo is reportedly set to go ahead with his nuclear power plans as officials in his department prepare to finalise the country's reviewed integrated energy resource plan. The City Press is reporting that while the energy deal was set to be finalised in February 2018, it will now be completed in the next two weeks. The nuclear energy plan is expected to cost the countryâ€™s economy R1 trillion, an amount Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says is neither affordable or immediately necessary. The City Press is reporting that Mahlobo told the paper that while government should not be reckless, energy is central to the country's security and shouldn't be treated as an economic issue. Mahlobo says every day more companies are closing down and young people remain unemployed. He says the African National Congress must not be deterred by political parties which want to stop it from implementing its programmes. Mahlobo says the criticism against the nuclear project is based on unfounded narratives about who may win the tender. He says his department wants to ensure the security of energy that's sustainable and that the need for extra energy is legitimate.
