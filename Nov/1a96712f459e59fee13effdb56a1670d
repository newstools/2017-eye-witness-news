                                         JOHANNESBURG - Joburg Water says that water cuts will continue for at least a few more hours after a burst pipe on Monday. Spokesperson Isaac Dhludhlu says they are experiencing some challenges. “They were struggling to cut the concrete that was below the pipes, it required some special engineering and now we have looked at the pipes from the inside.” The Fourways area will also be without water until 4pm due to planned maintenance work.
