                                         CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape says it has received no formal complaints from City of Cape Town Mayco member JP Smith regarding a smear campaign against him. Smith claims for the past two months people have been spreading misinformation about him and baseless complaints have been lodged with the Council speaker. He says it started shortly after reports that he wrote to party leadership about the shutting down of the city’s Special Investigations Unit, which he headed, and a probe into renovations at Mayor Patricia de Lille’s house. “Falsely submitting my details on websites for drug treatment ..."  Smith says he has a strong suspicion of who may be behind the alleged smear campaign, but he’s not mentioning names. Smith adds he has lodged a complaint but will not divulge with who or its nature. “I’m unwilling to indicate whether that’s a political or another link, but we’ve been able to identify one source of the link and it has been escalated.” DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela says he’s not aware of such a complaint being lodged with the party. “He’s not obliged to tell. He’s only obliged to tell us if this implicates one of our members.” Smith says his lawyers are investigating the smear campaign. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
