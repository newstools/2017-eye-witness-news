                                         JOHANNESBURG - Three family members will appear in the Palm Ridge magistrates court on charges of rape on Friday morning. Police say that two brothers were allegedly repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted by their under-age cousin and grandfather while the grandmother watched in their Benoni home. The boys were aged two and four at the time. The Palm Ridge magistrates court is expected to set a trial date for the case this morning. The matter was first heard in March this year and has been postponed several times since. The National Prosecuting Authority’s Phindi Mjonondwane says the delays were caused by a number of issues. “Firstly, the State needed to consult with the victims but the delays that have been happening since August have been from the defence’s side, as they requested that the 17-year-old must be sent for an assessment on his criminal capacity.” The defence is expected to present a medical report on the mental examination of one of the accused, thereafter, the court will make a decision on a trial date.
