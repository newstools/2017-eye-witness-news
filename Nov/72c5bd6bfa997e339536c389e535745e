                                         JOHANNESBURG - Wayde van Niekerk has been nominated for the IAAF World Athlete of the Year award for the upcoming awards ceremony in Monaco on 24 November 2017. Van Niekerk is the holder of the 400m World Record, when he ran a time of 43.03, smashing American Michael Johnson’s 17-year-old record at the Rio Olympics in August 2016. The speedster is also the first athlete to run sub 10 seconds in the 100m, sub 20 seconds in the 200m and sub 44 seconds in the 400m. The Cape Town-born sprinter is currently rehabilitating a torn ACL in his knee after sustaining the injury during a celebrity touch rugby game and will miss next year’s Commonwealth games in Australia’s Gold Coast in April. Van Niekerk will be up against stern competition in the three-man shortlist in the form of four-time Olympic gold medalist in the 5000m, Mo Farah from Britain, and Qatar’s Olympic silver medal winner in the high jump, Mutaz Essa Barshim. Meanwhile, the women’s category features Ethiopia’s long-distance athlete, Almaz Ayana, Greek pole vaulter Katerini Stefanidi and Belgium’s multi-event athlete Nafissatou Thiam.  The shortlist does not include South Africa’s 800m athlete Caster Semenya.
