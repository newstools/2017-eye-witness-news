                                         JOHANNESBURG - Reeva Steenkamp's parents say they feel they have now got justice for their daughter. The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on Friday lengthened Oscar Pistorius' jail sentence from six years to 13 and a half years. Pistorius shot Steenkamp in his home on Valentine's Day 2013 and was subsequently convicted of murder. June and Barry Steenkamp say they have always had faith in the country's justice system and Friday's decision by the SCA to lengthen Pistorius jail sentence proves this. Their spokesperson Tania Koen said: “They feel that justice has been served for Reeva and they also feel that Reeva can now rest in peace. But closure, they feel yes as far as the legal process is concerned. Closure, as far as Reeva is concerned, they feel no because they miss her every day and Reeva is not coming back.” Meanwhile, the Pistorius family will only comment on Saturday. However, Oscar's brother Carl tweeted three words following the judgment: "shattered, heartbroken, gutted". Shattered. Heartbroken. Gutted.
