                                         JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says that white monopoly capital exists at the expense of the black majority and that the concept should not be dismissed simply because Bell Pottinger misused it.  Malema was the final panellist at the Daily Maverick's The Gathering in Sandton on Thursday where speakers ranging from Mmusi Maimane, Jacques Pauw and Bantu Holomisa took part in the discussions. Malema added that government should stop buying cars for politicians who he says can clearly afford to purchase personal vehicles. “I don’t buy into Bell Pottinger’s narrative. I said this before Bell Pottinger became a thing in South Africa.” Malema says that white monopoly capital is a system that exists in South Africa, making a reference to the banking, mining and property sectors. He says that tackling white monopoly capital is not an attack on white people. “When we say white monopoly capital, we’re not saying white people, but you know they have become so fragile that when you attack white monopoly capital, they think you’re attacking them.”
