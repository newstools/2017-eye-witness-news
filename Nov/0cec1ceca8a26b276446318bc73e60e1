Bemawu's Hannes du Buisson says if the public broadcaster fails to negotiate a strike is back on the cards. JOHANNESBURG - Media union Bemawu has now turned to the CCMA to help resolve a salary dispute at the SABC after an internal dispute yielded no results this week. Last Friday, the union re-lodged a dispute internally with the public broadcaster demanding a 10% salary increase for workers. But the SABC refused to increase their offer of 0% resulting in Bemawu leaders filing a dispute with the CCMA. The union's Hannes du Buisson says if the public broadcaster fails to negotiate a strike is back on the cards. “We are waiting for CCMA to schedule conciliation and if they don’t within 30 days then we can go on strike.”
