                                         CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC)'s Cape Town region claims some Democratic Alliance (DA) councillors will vote in favour of a motion of no confidence in Mayor Patricia De Lille. This comes as the mayor faces allegations that public money was spent on renovations at her home and that she turned a blind eye to claims of tender irregularities. The mayor has denied any wrongdoing. ANC Dullar Omar Region Chairperson Xolani Sotashe says they will table the motion when council sits next week. “There is a general corrupt relationship; the decision of council, we don’t trust anyone now and we want a purely independent investigation on these matters so we can be really able to get to the bottom of it.”
