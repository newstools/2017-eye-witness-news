                                         HARARE - Zimbabwe's former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa has arrived back in the country two days before he is due to be sworn in as a leader to replace Robert Mugabe. Thousands of citizens have lined the streets outside Zanu-PF’s headquarters in Harare, holding flags, toy crocodiles and placards waiting for Mnangagwa to address them. “Welcome back Mnangagwa” is a theme song at the Zanu-PF headquarters where hundreds are gathering to usher in the incoming interim president. While some are sitting and waiting for his arrival, the majority are dancing and waving placards that say: “True to your word, welcome back.” Outside the premises, a long queue of supporters can be seen being searched by military personnel as they walk their way in.
