                                         JOHANNESBURG - Small Business and Enterprises Minister Lindiwe Zulu says that in 1994, economic freedom should have been fought for alongside political freedom. The minister was speaking about the need for radical economic transformation at the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sacci) conference on Thursday in Sandton, Johannesburg  Minister Zulu says that black economic empowerment is not only necessary but it is only fair. She says while it’s too late to cry over spilt milk, economic freedom should have been fought for as much as political freedom prior to 1994.  She says trying to convince the private sector of the unjustness of apartheid's exclusion of black people from the economy has been an unnecessary challenge. “And then we had people who were fronting and doing all kinds of things and then we were also made to feel very bad as people about this BEE, like we’re coming out to grab other people’s sweat.”  Premier David Makhura says the provincial government has already started implementing radical socio-economic transformation while others debate the concept.
