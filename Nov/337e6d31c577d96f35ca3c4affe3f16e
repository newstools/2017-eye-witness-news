Lackay says in 2014, Sars commissioner Tom Moyane refused to take action about information of taxpayers affairs that was leaked to the public. JOHANNESBURG - Former South African Revenue Service (Sars) spokesperson Adrian Lackay says there is no consistency at the revenue service when it comes to protecting confidential information of taxpayers. Lackay was speaking on the Karima Brown Show on Monday evening about the agency’s intention of taking legal action against author Jacques Pauw's book, which contains allegations against President Jacob Zuma relating to corruption and irregularities with his tax affairs. Sars says its bound by a confidentiality clause and cannot comment on any taxpayer's information in the public domain arguing that it’s against the law Lackay says in 2014, Sars commissioner Tom Moyane refused to take action about information of taxpayers affairs that was leaked to the public. “Now we come to 2017, a book is published - a very brave and courageous effort made by Jacques Pauw and his publishers - if I may add and exposes are made about the tax affairs of the head of the state. Suddenly the revenue service jumps into action and threatening criminal charges.” Cease Desist by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd
