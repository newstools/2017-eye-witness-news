                                         JOHANNESBURG - With less than 30 days to go before the African National Congress's (ANC) elective conference, Eyewitness News is taking a look at the possible scenarios that may unfold after the vote. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa still appear to be leading the pack from branch nominations across the country. This week, we examine what a potential Ramaphosa victory might mean for the country. The CR17 campaign has told EWN it’s not that worried about court challenges should Ramaphosa emerge victorious, saying if the nomination process is clean, there should be no concerns about legal processes. Three political analysts, including Mcebisi Ndletyana, agree that Ramaphosa’s credibility may save the ANC come 2019. “He will most likely be able to send a message that the ANC is on the mend.” Fellow analyst Ralph Mathekga explains what he believes is likely to happen to President Jacob Zuma if Ramaphosa wins. “He’s going to have to leave but the question is under what conditions will he leave?” The analysts also warn that even under Ramaphosa presidency, it will be difficult for the ANC to regain lost trust. They say Dlamini Zuma's supporters may choose to remain in the ANC and fight back – instead of leaving the party. LISTEN: The Showdown: What a Ramaphosa presidency means
