                                         CAPE TOWN - Government says the cost of meeting this year's wage demands of public sector unions is R282 billion. The acting director-general of the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) has revealed the figure at Parliament on Wednesday. Wage negotiations take place against a backdrop of low economic growth and strained public finances while workers are contending with the higher cost of living. DPSA’s acting director-general Willie Vukela says the figure of R282 billion was arrived at by officials from the department and National Treasury and is based on public sector unions’ demands. Vukela was accompanied by the government’s chief negotiator in the wage talks, Mpfariseni Phophi. “If, hypothetically, tomorrow, the team under Mr Phophi the chief negotiator says to government – adopt, agree with everything here – we need R282 billion the following week.” Unions are asking for double-digit increases of between 10 and 12% for employees on levels 4 to 12 in a single-year agreement. They also want housing allowances increased from R1,200 to R2,500 and for this to be paid to spouses when they also work for the government.
