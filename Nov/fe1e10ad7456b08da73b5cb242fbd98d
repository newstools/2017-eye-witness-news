                                         DURBAN - As African National Congress (ANC) branch general meetings convene ahead of the crucial elective conference, 247 branches in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have nominated Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma  to become president. According to the numbers so far, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has made some headway in three of the province's 10 regions. Unsurprisingly, Dr Dlamini Zuma is at this stage leading the presidential race in KZN.  She is neck-and-neck with Ramaphosa in the Lower South Coast, Abaqulusi and Inkosi Bhambhatha regions. KZN ANC Youth League Chair Kwazi Mshengu said: “Out of the total branches that have convened in KZN, 247 have nominated comrade Nkosazana and comrade Cyril has been nominated by 69 branches.” There are around 500 branches that still need to meet and nominate their leadership. At this stage, Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza has been nominated for deputy president, Nathi Mthethwa as chairperson, Nomvula Mokonyane for treasurer general, Ace Magashule as secretary-general, with Jesse Duarte as his deputy.
