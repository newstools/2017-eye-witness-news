                                         DURBAN - Council members in the Msunduzi Municipality in Pietermaritzburg have been left shaken by the murder of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) speaker's bodyguard. The man assigned to the councillor was shot once, before being dragged out of the official vehicle and shot several more times at close range. KZN has been in the spotlight in recent months for its high number of political killings. The Msunduzi Municipality falls under the Moses Mabhida region which has been unequivocal in its support for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma ahead of the crucial elective conference. But the bodyguard who was gunned down on Wednesday had been protecting Council Speaker Jabu Ngubo who is believed to be backing Zweli Mkhize. Msunduzi Municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha has called for residents to wait for the final outcome of a police investigation “Once we have facts, only then we will start communicating, but at the moment we do not believe the incidents are related.” The municipality maintains there is no immediate threat to Ngubo's life and the speaker having a bodyguard is no different to the protection others receive in different regions
