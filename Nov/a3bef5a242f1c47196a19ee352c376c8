                                         DURBAN - Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans (MKMVA) in KZN have described the hoisting of the apartheid flag during “Black Monday” protests as an act of provocation and are warning treasonous acts will not be tolerated. The MKMVA has held a briefing in Durban where it announced a protest will be held next week to raise awareness about the killing of black farm workers. “If someone burns the flag, that person has undermined the state and the government; what other provocation can you expect?” KZN MKMVA chair Themba Mavundla says the burning of the South African flag and hoisting of the apartheid one, undermines the country’s democracy and those who died fighting for it. “By us keeping quiet, it raises the arrogance of the Boers and that is the reason that we felt that we should not leave it as it is. It happened in one province, what if it spreads?” Mavundla says they won’t sit back while some in this country work to make South Africa an apartheid state again. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
