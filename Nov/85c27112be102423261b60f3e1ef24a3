                                         JOHANNESBURG - Shoppers have expressed mixed feelings about the Black Friday madness. Retailers are offering a variety of sale items with discounts of up to 50%. If crowds are not your thing, then you shouldn’t be making your way to Sandton City Mall as stores are packed with people eager to capitalise on discounts.  One woman says she waited over two hours for Checkers to open, but it was worth the wait. “Normally I buy eight toilet papers from around R200, but today I bought about 54 for R877.”  A man says he was dragged to the mall by his wife only to spend more than they had budgeted. “My wife fell for it, I didn’t. She likes the specials, I guess. They aren’t really specials unless you’re buying for three households.” While the early birds have started making their way out of the mall, many are still streaming in. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
