                                         LONDON - German police responding to a late-night drunken argument between two men discovered one of them had a python hidden in his underwear.  No, it's not what you think. The young man spent the night behind bars after officers noticed an unusual outline in his clothing. He may now be charged under animal welfare laws. Police were called after residents in Darmstadt, western Germany, reported a night-time disturbance involving two men.  But after being questioned about a "significant bulge in his trousers", one of the men, a 19-year-old, revealed he was concealing a baby snake. He handed a 36cm royal python to officers and was taken to the police station to sober up. The owner of the reptile is being sought, while police are deciding whether the so-called non-species-appropriate transport means the teenager should be charged under animal protection regulations.
