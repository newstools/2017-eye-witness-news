                                         CAPE TOWN - A private member’s bill to legalise cannabis for medical use has been hailed for paving the way for new regulations that will also allow for it to be grown, cultivated and manufactured.  The Medical Innovation Bill was first introduced in the National Assembly by the late Inkatha Freedom Party MP Mario Oriani-Ambrosini in 2014, soon after he was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. The IFP says the new regulations go even further than Oriani-Ambrosini had hoped for. Last week regulations were published in the Government Gazette that outline under what conditions cannabis and cannabinoids can be used for medicinal use under the Medicine and Related Substances Act. Two years after his death, Oriani-Ambrosini has been hailed for kick starting the process. The IFP’s Narend Singh says given the new scheduling status of cannabis, the bill’s objective and purpose have been achieved. “This report is a win for all parties and gives credence of choice to people and with credible regulation, I think we’ve made a giant step in the healthcare sector in South Africa." Cannabis products now fall under schedule 6 medication, obtainable through a prescription from a medical doctor.
