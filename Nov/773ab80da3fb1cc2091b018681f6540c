Kim Robbertse was rearrested last week while she was out on bail. CAPE TOWN - An alleged bogus travel agent accused of fraud is expected back in court next week. Kim Robbertse was rearrested last week while she was out on bail. Robbertse, aged 36, reportedly pocketed R7 million from her unlawful activities. She was initially arrested in Durbanville, Cape Town, last year following a wave of complaints countrywide. The Hawks’ Lloyd Ramovha says: “The arrest follows complaints from around the country. She allegedly had victims pay for unfounded plane tickets, but she never delivered.” It's alleged that she tricked victims into paying deposits for cheap flights online. Some of the victims were reportedly left stranded at airports on the day of their scheduled journeys. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
