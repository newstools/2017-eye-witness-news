                                         CAPE TOWN - Basic Education Deputy Minister Enver Surty says proposed changes to the Schools Act must be considered in the context of social justice and the ethos of the Constitution. He’s on Tuesday briefed Parliament’s Basic Education Portfolio Committee on the draft bill that has been criticised for limiting the power of School Governing Bodies (SGBs) to appoint staff and decide language and admission policies. Parents opposed to the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill have signed an online petition calling on parliamentarians to reject it. Surty insists his department is not trying to shut out SGBs with the proposed amendments. “I can give you the assurance that the intention is not to close out governing bodies but to ensure that we have a system where there is no confusion about where the locus of authority is.” The draft bill blocks schools from using their admission policies to exclude certain learners. It also requires schools to consider different cultural and religious beliefs when crafting codes of conduct. Surty says there will be sufficient time for public consultation as the law-making process is in its early stages. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
