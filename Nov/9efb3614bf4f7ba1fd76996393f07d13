                                         JOHANNESBURG - Seven people have been killed and four others injured when two sedans collided on the N4 near Belfast on Sunday afternoon. The Department of Safety says the Mercedes Benz was driving from Belfast while the Kia was in the opposite direction. Department spokesperson Joseph Mabuza said: “One vehicle veered towards the oncoming vehicle’s direction resulting in the collision. The weather was very bad, so we suspect that the road was also slippery.”
