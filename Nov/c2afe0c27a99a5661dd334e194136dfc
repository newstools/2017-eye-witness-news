                                         JOHANNESBURG - The City of Joburg believes that a break-in at one of its data centres where cables and equipment have been stolen may have been an inside job. Mayor Herman Mashaba has offered a R100,000 reward for information that can lead to the successful prosecution of those responsible for the weekend burglary. The city is in the process of building its own information and communication technology service, which will now be delayed due to the crime. Mashaba says they are hoping police will make arrests soon. “The service provider who’s helping building this infrastructure for us strongly suspects this must be an inside job.  “They have promised that they’re going to vet all the guys who are working for them, including doing lie detectors. Everyone thinks this is an inside job.” (Edited by Leeto M  Khoza)
