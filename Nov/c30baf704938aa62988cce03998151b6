                                         CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma says he’s yet to receive from the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) the proclamation relating to its investigation into Eskom. Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown wants the SIU to carry out a wide-ranging probe into corruption and state capture at the power utility. The SIU said last month it had forwarded its motivation for the investigation to the Department of Justice, which would then send the proclamation to the presidency for Zuma to sign. Cope’s Deirdre Carter wanted to know what the SIU would investigate regarding Eskom and over what period. She also asked if the probe would include the emergency coal and diesel contracts Eskom has entered into since January 2001. In his written reply, President Zuma simply says he has yet to receive the proclamation relating to Eskom. Minister Brown in May said she wanted the SIU to carry out a broad inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing against Eskom. Her spokesperson Colin Cruywagen says Brown has agreed to the terms of reference for the probe with the SIU. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
