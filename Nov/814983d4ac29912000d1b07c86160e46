                                         BANGUI - Doctors Without Borders has reintroduced all its services in a Central African Republic town ravaged by heavy fighting. At least 10,000 Batangafo residents sought refuge on MSF’s hospital grounds, when armed groups burnt down tents in a camp for internally displaced residents. The relief organisation was forced to scale down its activities in the town in August.  While thousands of Batangafo residents sought refuge at MSF’s medical facility, 5,000 moved to the local church and at least 1,000 fled to various areas around the town. MSF field communications manager Natacha Buhler says that life-saving medical care has now been restored to the area. “Most recently, in October, they were fighting outside of town, it was very difficult for us to go there to people. It was also very difficult for those people to come here.” She says that the area remains volatile as armed rebels still have a dominant presence there. During the first six months of the year, Doctors Without Borders treated over 200,000 people for malaria and assisted with almost 10,000 births. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
