                                         JOHANNESBURG - Experienced Springbok and Toulon loose forward Duane Vermeulen  has been included in the Springbok end of year tour squad in place of the injured Coenie Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen injured his knee in the early stages of the record 38-3 defeat to Ireland on Saturday and will return home to undergo surgery. Vermeulen will join the squad at the base in Paris ahead of the game against France on Saturday 18 November. The Toulon player has represented the Springboks 37 times during his international career, but injury has halted his career in the green and gold considerably in the last few years. The Boks were also dealt with another injury blow in the dying stages of Saturdayâ€™s game when loose forward Pieter-Steph du Toit left the field and has been ruled out with a concussion. The inclusion of Vermeulen will add much-needed experience and physicality to a Springbok side that was outsmarted against the Irish.
