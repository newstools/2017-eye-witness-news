                                         JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says the African National Congress (ANC)  wants to remove Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba through a motion of no confidence because its afraid that the DA will replace it as the governing party in the country. Party members have marched through the streets of Braamfontein to the city council in support of Mashaba and speaker Vasco da Gama. At the same time, the Economic Freedom Fighters's Floyd Shivambu has tweeted that his party will not support the ANC's motion to remove the mayor and speaker. The voting process for the motion of no confidence is the last item on the council meeting’s agenda and is expected to take place late on Thursday afternoon. Maimane has accused the previous ANC-led Johannesburg mayor Parks Tau of stealing the city’s money when he was in power. “They stole R16 billion and the Hawks are coming, and they’re saying: let us remove Herman.” Maimane says more coalitions need to be formed elsewhere to push the ANC out of power. #JhbMotion DA councillors waving at marchers as they pass the building.
