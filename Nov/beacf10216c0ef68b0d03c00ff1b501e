                                         NIGERIA - The Niger Delta Avengers (NDA), a militant group in the creeks of the oil-rich Southern Nigeria region has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of not being sincere with his peace talks and promises for the Niger Delta. The group says it will resume the attacks on oil and gas installations in the region which account for almost 90% of Nigeria's revenue. The group which had aborted attacks on oil installations in the Niger Delta region last year, to enable the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dialogue with the Nigerian Government, said it would suspend its ceasefire this weekend. The Niger Delta Avengers, in a statement by the spokesman, self-styled “General” Mudoch Agbinibo, said the group will not spare anything or anyone in their path to actualise a united and free Niger Delta. General Agbinibo threatened that, unlike their 2016 campaign, which they carried out successfully without any casualties, the relaunch of their campaign will be brutal and bloody The Nigerian government is yet to respond to the latest threat by the militants.
