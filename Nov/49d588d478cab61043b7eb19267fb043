The Bloemfontein High Court ruled that the ANC Free State provincial conference cannot go ahead as scheduled this weekend because branch general meetings held in four regions were unlawful. JOHANNESBURG - As the African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State reschedules its elective conference after the Bloemfontein High Court’s decision to bar it from holding it on Friday, questions are emerging on what kind of impact all these legal challenges will have on the party’s national elective conference next month. On Wednesday, the court ruled that the party’s Free State provincial conference cannot go ahead as scheduled this weekend because branch general meetings held in four regions over the last four months were unconstitutional, unlawful, irregular and in breach of the ANC constitution. The ruling also brings into question the provincial general council that was hastily arranged earlier this week. The Free State ANC leadership will have to defy a previous order instructing it to hold an elective conference tomorrow, in order to implement the new one barring it from holding that gathering. Free State ANC spokesperson Thabo Meeko admits that the recent court outcome is problematic for the party. “Because this has got nothing to do with Free State ANC, it has got to do with the national conference of the ANC in December.” Meanwhile, there is also a court battle on Thursday where the KwaZulu-Natal ANC is applying for leave to appeal the September ruling which nullified the provincial executive. The recent Eastern Cape elective conference is also being appealed. At this stage, it’s unclear to what extent all these cases will affect the national conference next month. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
