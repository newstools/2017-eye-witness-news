                                         JOHANNESBURG - Bidvest Wits midfielder Vincent Pule says that victory in the Telkom Knockout final is of paramount importance in their efforts to revive their league form.  The Clever Boys take on Bloemfontein Celtic in Durban on Saturday and will be looking to win their first title of the season. Pule believes that victory in the TKO final is a chance at redemption for their poor form in the league which has seen the defending champions rooted to the bottom of the table.  "The cup competition is different to the league. We owe it to ourselves to win the Telkom Knockout final, and maybe that can help us perform better in the league."  Bidvest Wits overcame Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in the semi-finals, through a James Keane goal at the Bidvest Stadium, while Bloemfontein Celtic had to do it the hard way, winning 4-3 on penalties against Polokwane City to reach the final.  Kick-off for the Telkom Knockout final at the Princess Magogo Stadium is at 6pm on Saturday.
