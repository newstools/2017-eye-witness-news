                                         CAPE TOWN - Eskom’s chairperson Zethembe Khoza has taken a dim view of astounding claims made by two Eskom employees in Parliament. Khulani Qoma, the board's spokesperson and the utility's suspended head of legal, Suzanne Daniels, have told MPs about governance lapses and dubious deals at the parastatal. They were called as witnesses in an inquiry into allegations of state capture at Eskom. Their appearances in Parliament have been followed by a flurry of media statements from the Public Enterprises Ministry and Eskom. Khoza says that the parastatal is distancing itself from whatever the pair told lawmakers. On Tuesday, Qoma claimed Khoza told him that Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown was captured and therefore reported to the Gupta brothers. “You can’t have the best board and best executives when you have an atrocious shareholder. In this instance it’s Minister Brown.” The minister denies taking instructions from anybody. Khoza says several witnesses have clearly represented their own interests at the expense of the organization and the country. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
