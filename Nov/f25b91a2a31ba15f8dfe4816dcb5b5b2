                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it can reveal that minutes of South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board meeting shows that MultiChoice sought to pay the public broadcaster R100 million for its 24 hour news channel in exchange for its political influence over digital migration. The DA says that the minutes from the meeting held in June 2013 form part of hundreds of documents provided by the SABC to the ad hoc committee investigating the SABC and supports allegations that MultiChoice paid Gupta-owned ANN7 millions of rand in exchange for similar influence over government's position on set-top boxes. The opposition party says that the minutes reveal a clandestine meeting attended by former SABC board members and executives, including Ellen Tshabalala, Hlaudi Motsoeneng and Jimi Matthews. The DA’s shadow Minister for Communications Phumzile van Damme says: “The allegations are very serious indeed and as such the DA has referred this matter to Icasa for thorough investigation.”    Minutes of the Meeting Betweenthe Board and Multichoice 6 June 2013 by Primedia Broadcasting on Scribd
