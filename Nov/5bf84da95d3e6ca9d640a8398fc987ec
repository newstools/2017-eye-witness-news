                                         CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Health Department is assuring patients that plans are in place to keep water flowing should day zero arrive. The cape is experiencing its worst drought in a century with dam levels hovering at 36%. Health authorities are working with the Public Works Department and city officials to keep the taps flowing in the essential services sector. Health department spokesperson Marika Champion says an emergency water plan is in place. “Some water-saving interventions are long-term and have been in place for a number of years. For instance, ensuring energy efficient infrastructure, if we build new hospital facilities. Some are in the short term to ensure that we survive dry seasons.” BEAUFORT WEST DAM RUNS DRY The Central Karoo town of Beaufort West has run out of dam water. Residents now rely on boreholes and recycled sewage water. The Western Cape Local Government Department's James-Brent Styan says that the Gamka Dam, which is the main source of drinking water for Beaufort West residents is empty. Last week, dam storage levels declined by 0,7% to 37,8% (27,8% usable water) in Cape Town. Collective usage was at 602 million litres per day. This is 102 million litres above what is required for the city to get through the drought. Additional reporting by Shamiela Fisher. WATCH: CT's dam levels remain low  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
