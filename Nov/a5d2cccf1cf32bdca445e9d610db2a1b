                                         NEW YORK - Authorities in New York have added extra security measures to Sunday's New York City Marathon.  Over 50,000 people will be taking part in the world's biggest marathon, five days after a terror attack in lower Manhattan in which eight people were killed.  New York governor Andrew Cuomo has doubled the number of state troopers, tripled the number of National Guard soldiers and increased police presence along the marathon route by 50%. State Police will also beef up posts at JFK and La Guardia airports - as an extra precaution. Although there are no reports of any credible threat to the event, which also sees hundreds of thousands of spectators line the streets, police will also be deployed at checkpoints along the route as well. Celebrities such as Kevin Hart and Karlie Kloss will be among the 51,000 participants.
