                                         JOHANNESBURG - Danish national Peter Frederiksen has been found guilty in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on 36 charges ranging from rape, fraud, conspiracy to murder and the possession of firearms.  Frederiksen was arrested at his home in Langenhoven Park in 2015 after female body parts were found in his freezer.  The Free State's National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phaladi Shuping said: “The judge decided to drop counts relating to the removal of human tissues. He owned two firearms, one in Maseru and another in Bloemfontein and our focus was more on the one that is in the Free State.”
