Exams officially end on Tuesday with Agricultural Management Practices in the morning and a three-hour Design paper in the afternoon. Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer said: “This week many matric candidates will be heading to annual matric rage parties in towns across the province, particularly in Hermanus and Plettenberg Bay. Matric candidates have worked very hard to get to this point in their lives. And while they deserve to celebrate, we appeal to them to do so responsibly.”
