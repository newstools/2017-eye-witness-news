                                         DURBAN - African National Congress (ANC) treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize says that the party is still capable of eliminating factionalism if all the presidential candidates commit to unity. Mkhize spoke to Eyewitness News during a wide-ranging interview on Wednesday, where he shared his plans to meet with his contenders, their campaign teams and provincial leaders ahead of the elective conference. When speaking about issues of factionalism within the ANC, Mkhize is quick to refer to how he and then provincial contender Sbu Ndebele resolved the political impasse in KwaZulu-Natal at the time. He says that during that race, as leaders, they went out publicly to reject their slates and telling their supporters not to divide the ANC in their name. Mkhize believes that the same can be done with the current presidential hopefuls. "Process of unifying the ANC and defusing the hostilities of the campaigns must start even before the conference sits." Mkhize says it must become a norm to know that presidential hopefuls and their campaigners have been meeting because this is the only way to foster unity.
