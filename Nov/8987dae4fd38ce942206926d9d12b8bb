                                         JOHANNESBURG - The head of a Kenyan observers’ group says last month’s repeat presidential election faced challenges that were “not conducive” for a free and fair process. Regina Opondo, chair of the elections observation group, has told Kenyan television that “the environment was not secure” in some areas during the vote, which the main opposition group boycotted. Opondo says it’s doubtful that Kenya’s election commission was able to conduct “significant and comprehensive voter education” ahead of the vote, which was a rerun of the August election that was nullified by the supreme court over irregularities.
