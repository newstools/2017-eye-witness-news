                                         CAPE TOWN - The Cape Flats Aquifer is set to deliver an additional 25 million litres of water per day from June next year. The city is in the grips of the worst drought in decades and authorities are scrambling to ward off day zero - the day the taps run dry.   Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille on Sunday joined contractors to conduct an aerial survey of the aquifer - which is an underground layer of water-bearing rock - in a bid to confirm the prime locations of where the highest volume of water can be extracted from. Helicopters used for this survey fly approximately 60 to 70 metres above the ground, using electromagnetic equipment to detect the presence of water.  The city will be using the Atlantis-Silwerstroom Aquifer, the Cape Flats Aquifer, and Table Mountain Group Aquifer to supplement surface water supplies. De Lille elaborates more on the application of this technology. “They will collect data which will assist us for when we start with the drilling for underground water, so that we can go directly to the place that will give us the highest yield of water. This is very exciting work and is the first time it’s been done in the city of Cape Town.” The metro’s collective dam levels are currently at 36%, with 26% usable. De Lille says the city will turn off the taps when dam levels reach about 13%. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
