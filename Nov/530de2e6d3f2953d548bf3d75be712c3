                                         JOHANNESBURG - Robert Mugabe has addressed the people of Zimbabwe but did not resign as the leader of the country. The address was made just hours after the ruling Zanu-PF party recalled the 93-year-old as Zanu-PF leader and gave him a deadline of midday on Monday to leave the presidency. This follows a military takeover of government last week and a nationwide march demanding Mugabe to step down on Saturday. It had been widely expected that Mugabe would announce his decision to step down this evening after 37 years of rule. The elderly statesman, addressing the nation in a special broadcast, says that a meeting with the military leaders on Sunday has made him aware of issues that need to be addressed in the country. Mugabe says that army intervention was "triggered by concerns arising from their reading of the state of affairs in the country and in the ruling Zanu-PF party".     #Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe finishes his speech with no mention of resignation...  Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was fired as vice president earlier this month, has been reinstated as interim president and first secretary of the party pending ratification at the party's December congress. He is also the party's nominee to take over as president of the country. Vice president Phelekezela Mphoko has been recalled from his position for being divisive. Mugabe's wife, Grace, has been recalled as secretary of the Zanu-PF women's league and has been expelled from the party, along with Johathan Moyo and Walter Mzembe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Patrick Zhuwao, and Ignatius Chombo, who are all members of the so-called G40 cabal supporting Grace Mugabe.
