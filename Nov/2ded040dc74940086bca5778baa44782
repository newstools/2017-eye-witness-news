                                         JOHANNESBURG - While Wednesday marks the last day for the African National Congress (ANC)’s branches to nominate leaders for the party’s elective conference next month, secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has revealed that many branches won’t meet the deadline. Despite this, the ANC says it’s ready for its elective conference which will be attended by 5,240 voting delegates. ANC branches are still lagging behind with their nominations despite today’s deadline. Mantashe says the party may have to intervene to expedite the process. “Obviously we’ll see where we need to intervene that basically three provinces that need to be helped to accelerate the process.” Those provinces are KwaZulu-Natal at 40.8%, North West at 54,3% and the Eastern Cape which is at 56%. Despite this, Mantashe says they are confident of a successful 54th national congress. He says there are teams in nine provinces dealing with disputes arising from BGM’s. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
