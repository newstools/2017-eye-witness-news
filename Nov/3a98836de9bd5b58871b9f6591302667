                                         PRETORIA - Scientists have developed a breathalyser test for malaria. It’s an advancement that could fast-track efforts to eliminate the disease. Missouri biologists have road-tested a technique that senses the malaria parasite in samples of ­infected people’s breath. The ­results, outlined at a conference in Baltimore, are built on an Australian discovery that malaria sufferers exhale high levels of certain chemicals. The test could accelerate ­diagnosis because the chemicals spike at very early stages of infection when other techniques can fail to detect the parasite. The new approach also offers a cheap alternative to lab-based DNA or blood analyses and finger-prick tests which can ­diagnose malaria in the field, but lack sensitivity and are losing reliability as the parasites mutate.
