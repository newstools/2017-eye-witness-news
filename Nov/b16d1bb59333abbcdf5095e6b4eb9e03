                                         JOHANNESBURG - The City of Johannesburg’s Forensic and Investigation team has confirmed that five people have been arrested for the hijacking of buildings in the city this week. A couple was arrested for allegedly hijacking a property in Kenilworth on Friday night and three others in Jeppestown on Thursday. In Jeppestown one suspect was found in possession of ammunition and two others in possession of drugs. Five compliance notices have also been issued to shop owners in the area. Group forensic and investigation services director Lucky Sindane says no undocumented foreign nationals were arrested because the Home Affairs Department did not participate in the operation. “Many people come to us to say ‘please assist, my building has been hijacked, I would like to win back my building.’ We then investigate the ownership of that property to ascertain if they are indeed the rightful owners.”
