"The suspect is due to appear in court on Monday to face charges of attempted murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm." In a separate incident last night, police arrested a man and woman in Lwandle for being in possession of a tub of tik, six packets of tik, scales and cash to the tune of R109,160.
