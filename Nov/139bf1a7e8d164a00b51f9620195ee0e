                                         CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille has promised to respond to explosive allegations that she has been turning a blind eye to misconduct and irregularities in the city’s Transport Department. The allegations are contained in an affidavit by a top executive in her office Craig Kesson. It was released at an extraordinary council meeting earlier on Tuesday. Kesson was one of Patricia De Lille's closest allies, just months ago they launched a book that they had co-written. But in an affidavit in Eyewitness News' possession, Kesson alleges De Lille condoned misconduct in the city’s Transport Department headed by Melissa Whitehead. He claims the mayor batted away his concerns about irregularities within the transport authority... that came to light in numerous external forensic reports. These include millions in losses incurred by the MyCiti buses and the stalling of the Foreshore Freeway tender. Kesson claims he’s been threatened for insisting that the irregularities be probed and reported to council. De Lille says she was not afforded the opportunity to respond to the claims when Kesson deposed the affidavit. She’s now handed the matter over to her lawyers and has promised a full response by the end of the week.
