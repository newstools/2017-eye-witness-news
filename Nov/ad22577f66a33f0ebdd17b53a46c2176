                                         JOHANNESBURG - South African Revenue Services (Sars) commissioner Tom Moyane will have to answer to Parliament’s standing committee on finance as to why he awarded bonuses of R3 million without first getting the Finance Minister’s permission. Among those to benefit was Jonas Makwakwa, who was paid a bonus of nearly R1 million. Makwakwa was controversially reinstated after a lengthy suspension, triggered by revelations about suspicious transactions involving him and his partner, fellow Sars employee Kelly-Ann Elskie. Questions about the probe into Makwakwa and his exoneration of any wrongdoing after a disciplinary hearing are also on the committee’s agenda. Sars' annual report was finally tabled in Parliament on Thursday after a stand-off with the Auditor-General (AG) over the bonus payments, which included a threat by Sars of legal action against the AG.  Chairperson Yunus Carrim says Sars will come before the standing committee on finance on Tuesday. “The delayed annual report will have to be considered by the committee. Secondly, we are going to take further our engagements with Sars around the Makwakwa matter.” The AG did not qualify Sars’ audit and notes that Moyane is seeking an order from the Gauteng High Court that he is not required to first get the finance minister’s approval before paying bonuses. The Democratic Alliance’s Alf Lees said: “It is clearly the view of the Auditor-General that the payment of these bonuses without the approval of the Minister of Finance was illegal.” Gigaba earlier this month announced a judicial commission of inquiry into Sars’ tax administration and governance.
