                                         CAPE TOWN - A row has broken out over Parliament’s handling of an internal report that forms the basis for disciplinary charges pending against its most senior employee. Secretary to Parliament, Gengezi Mgidlana, faces disciplinary action relating to allegations of maladministration and abuse of power. He went on special leave in June at his own request, while Parliament’s internal audit committee investigated the claims.  The audit committee’s report will be kept under lock and key, and MPs will only be allowed to read it under supervision. They will have to sign in, and cellphones and note taking will not be allowed. This decision was taken on Thursday evening after fierce debate and a vote in the joint standing committee that oversees Parliament’s financial management. Committee co-chairperson Vincent Smith explains: “On Tuesday the executive authority reiterated that we must deal with this report in a manner that we don’t jeopardise the bigger picture, which is the DC.” But Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says he’ll be asking Speaker Baleka Mbete for committee members to get copies. “The document cannot be treated the way Mr Smith wants because Mr Smith, having had that document for a week without any other member of the committee having the document, has contaminated that process.” Mgidlana meanwhile has told Eyewitness News he’s confident he will be cleared of any wrongdoing.  He says his lawyers have informed Parliament of his reasons why he should not be placed on precautionary suspension, pending his disciplinary hearing.  Parliament’s presiding officers, Mbete and NCOP chairperson Thandi Modise last week gave him seven days in which to do so. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
