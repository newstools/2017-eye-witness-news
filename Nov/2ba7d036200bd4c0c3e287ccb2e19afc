                                         CAPE TOWN - Acting chairperson of Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises Zukiswa Rantho says that former Eskom officials, including Brian Molefe and Ben Ngubane, as well as Minister Lynne Brown will be called to give testimony before the committee investigating state capture allegations.  Although Eskom initially denied making any payments, it finally admitted to paying fees of R1.6 billion to consulting firms McKinsey and Trillian. A former Trillian employee turned whistle-blower Mosile Mothepu gave shocking testimony on Tuesday on the company's controversial relationship with Eskom and how senior executives at the Gupta-linked company knew about former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene's sacking six weeks before it happened. Rantho says all those implicated must appear before the committee and explain themselves. “I’m not sure when we’re going to call them because we’re still calling people for information. We’ll call all those being affected, and they’ll come and testify in front of the committee. They’ll put their story forward to the committee. They have to, they will come.” She says she believes Brown is innocent. “According to what we’ve heard yesterday, Minister Brown has been misled. So, she may have presented the wrong information in Parliament. The information was received from entities. I can’t blame her 100%.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
