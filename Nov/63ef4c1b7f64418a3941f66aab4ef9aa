                                         JOHANNESBURG - Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa says that he intends to meet with Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba following the resignation of Treasury’s Michael Sachs, saying that it’s a pity to lose Sachs but hopefully he can be persuaded to return to his job. Ramaphosa delivered the keynote address at the African National Congress (ANC) greater Johannesburg’s economic colloquium in Orlando East in Soweto on Monday night. In attendance was former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and ANC national executive committee member Jackson Mthembu. Ramaphosa described Sachs as one who was great at his job. “If you were to ask him how much money has been allocated to a clinic in Orlando, he would give you a figure instantly from the top of his head.” The deputy president says it’s a pity that Michael Sachs resigned and he says that he intends to meet Gigaba to discuss retaining staff who are good at their jobs. It’s been widely reported that Sachs resigned last week over interference by President Jacob Zuma.
