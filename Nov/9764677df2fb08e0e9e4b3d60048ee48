                                         JOHANNESBURG - A bodyguard assigned to the provincial speaker has been gunned down in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Police say the 30-year-old man had been travelling in a municipal vehicle when he was shot dead in Cazula. The police's Thembeka Mbele says the motive is not yet known. “He was in a state car when he was attacked by two unknown suspects who fired several shots at him and fled the scene on foot. They tried to rush him to hospital but he died upon arrival.” KZN has been making headlines this year after a perceived spike in political killings.
