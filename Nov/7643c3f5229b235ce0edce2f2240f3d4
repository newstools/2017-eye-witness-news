                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has asked Riversand Primary in Soweto to institute a disciplinary hearing against the school's principal after she failed to report molestation allegations. An unknown number of pupils were allegedly molested by a pensioner who lives just 200 metres away from the school. The claims come as the department investigates several similar cases at schools in the province. Lesufi says he's disappointed in the way the allegations have been handled. “The principal claims she’s scared and that is why she can’t intervene. I really felt let down and that we have underestimated the impact and effects of protecting those children.”
