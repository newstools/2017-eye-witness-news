Four other cabinet members have also reportedly turned themselves in on Sunday morning. Belgian prosecutors, who have a European arrest warrant from Spain for Puigdemont and his associates, will brief media on the case at 13:00 GMT. The arrest warrant for Puigdemont was issued on Friday. He was wanted by Madrid for lying and disobedience. Catalonia has been in political upheaval since 1 October 2017, when the region held a disputed referendum on independence from Spain.
