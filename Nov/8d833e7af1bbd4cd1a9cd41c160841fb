                                         JOHANNESBURG - Itumeleng Khune has requested that a face mask be made available for the World Cup Qualifier with Senegal in Polokwane on Friday. Bafana’s first choice goalkeeper will see another specialist to re-assess the facial injury he sustained during Kaizer Chiefs' victory over Chippa United in the Telkom Knockout on Sunday.  Khune fractured a bone in his face when he collided with Chippa United forward Kurt Lentjies, which resulted in both players being stretchered off.  His absence leaves coach Stuart Baxter with a dilemma as to who will start in goal for the must-win match.  Baxter confirmed that the goalkeeper has requested that a face mask be readied for the game.  “Itu has asked us to get a mask ready for him, which means he is hopeful, but that could also be enthusiasm and ambition but the final decision will be taken by the medical staff.”  Hard at work; @BafanaBafana number one @IIKHUNE_32_16 busy on a workout in prep for Senegal on Friday #ComeShowYourLove pic.twitter.com/MBHClnpflH  Should Khune’s request be denied, Baxter will have to decide between Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands or Supersport United’s Ronwen Williams for Friday's game. Kick-off at the Peter Mokaba Stadium is at 7pm. Meanwhile, South African football fans have been having some fun on Twitter over Khune’s request for a protective mask.
