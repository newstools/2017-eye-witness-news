Khehla Sitole says immediately after taking office he sat down with Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to discuss a new vision and crime-combatting plan to clamp down on gang violence. CAPE TOWN – New National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole has indicated the army will not yet be deployed to gang-stricken communities. Earlier this month, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula had promised the military would be deployed to areas with high crime rates before Christmas. However, President Jacob Zuma has the final say on the matter and has not yet given the go-ahead. Sitole says immediately after taking office he sat down with Mbalula to discuss a new vision and crime combatting plan to clamp down on gang violence. “The minister decided we should give this vision the opportunity. So we are busy, together with the minister, to put this vision in action. If we still need the army’s support, we’ll align this with our vision.” The police ministry says it’s not yet able to comment on whether the deployment of the army will go ahead in gang stricken communities. The ministry's Vuyo Magha says further discussions will be held between Mbalula and Sitole. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
