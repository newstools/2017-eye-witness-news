                                         JOHANNESBURG - Newly leaked papers reveal that Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has invested some of her private money in offshore tax havens. According to documents obtained by the international consortium of journalists, the Queen's investment managers placed roughly R180 million in offshore portfolios in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Her use of offshore tax havens is likely to generate criticism from activists seeking to abolish the monarchy in favour of a republic.
