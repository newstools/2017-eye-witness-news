                                         JOHANNESBURG - Springbok captain Eben Etzebeth and hooker Malcom Marx will undergo scans on injuries they picked up during South Africa’s 18-17 victory over France on Saturday. Etzebeth and Marx picked up lower leg and shoulder injuries respectively and could be in doubt for the Boks’ clash with Italy in Padova. Marx will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of his shoulder injury.  “Eben and Malcolm’s X-rays were both normal, however, Malcolm will go for a MRI scan on Monday to further investigate his injury,” says team doctor Conrad von Hagen. Meanwhile vice-captain Siya Kolisi has returned home, ahead of the birth of his second child in the coming week, and will miss the Italy game, but will be back in camp for the clash against Wales in Cardiff.
