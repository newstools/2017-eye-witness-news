                                         JOHANNESBURG - South African golfer Dylan Frittelli says he is ready to compete with the world’s best golfers ahead of the Nedbank Golf Challenge (NGC) at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City starting on Thursday. Africa’s major boasts an impressive field of local and international golfers that will all be vying to be crowned the NGC champion of 2017. The last South African winner was Trevor Immelman in 2007. Frittelli says he is confident about his abilities to compete against the best in the world. “Now that I have broken into the top 100 golfers in the world, and have played a full season on the European Tour, I feel confident about competing against the best golfers in the world,” says Frittelli. Johannesburg-born Frittelli also says the Gary Player Country Club suits him well. “I’m used to the heat and dry conditions, I grew up here and the course is similar to the courses I grew up on so I’m excited to play here.” Frittelli will tee off at 9 am on Thursday along with Englishmen Graeme Storm and Ian Poulter.
