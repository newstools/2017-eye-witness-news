                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Young Communist League (YCL) says it won't depend on the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) to provide free education. The YCL says that the ANC has been given numerous opportunities to provide free education and failed.  The league held a progressive black academic summit in Johannesburg at the weekend, attended by deputy Higher Education Minister Buti Manamela and presidential hopeful Zweli Mkhize. The YCL says that the summit made it clear that the league is on its own in pushing the agenda of free education.  The summit took place under the theme ‘decommodification of higher education in our current epoch, towards free education for the poor’. The league's Molaodi Wasekake says: “We need free education for everyone, especially for the poor, so that we unleash the potential of every young person in this country.” The league says it doesn't support the Heher Commission's report on higher education, arguing that giving loans to students from commercial banks will only put students into more debt.
