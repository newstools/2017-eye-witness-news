                                         CAPE TOWN - The Office of the Chief Justice says that no one has attempted to influence the timing of former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe's court case involving his pension payout. The department, which manages the judiciary, released a statement on Friday in response to startling revelations that have emerged out of Parliament's probe into allegations of state capture at Eskom. Under oath, the power utility's suspended head of legal Suzanne Daniels testified that Ajay Gupta told her he wanted to make sure Molefe's case was not heard before December. Daniels told MPs that Gupta said he would contact someone in the deputy Judge President's office to get the court dates he wanted. The Office of the Chief Justice say that it has taken note of the explosive testimony, prompting it to issue a statement, reassuring the public that no one's exerting influence over the judiciary. Spokesperson Nathi Mcnube says: “Everything is above board. There has been no attempt whatsoever from anyone, or any of the parties concerned in the matter, to contact either the deputy judge president, the judge president or the officials of the court.”  Molefe's case has been set down for 29 November.
