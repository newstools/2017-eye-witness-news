Classes were cancelled at the varsity last week when about 200 protesters went on the rampage over a proposal to hike fees next year. Seven protesters who were arrested are now out on bail. Last week, UCT announced that preparations for the final exams will not be affected by protests and disruptions. Vice-chancellor Max Price said some of the 200 protesters were not part of the university or registered students.   Additional reporting by Graig-Lee Smith.
