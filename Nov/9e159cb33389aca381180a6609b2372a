                                         CAPE TOWN - In the Winnie Rust murder trial, the State has argued the accused had a direct intention to kill her after they robbed her in her Wellington home. The closing argument has been delivered in the trial against Nigel and Johannes Plaaitjies on Monday. They are accused of strangling the 77-year-old in May last year. Prosecutor Freek Geyser agrees with the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem on Rust, that two people, and not just one, were likely behind her murder. Geyser says the tape that was used to cover Rust's mouth as well as the ropes which were used to tie her up, were not from her home. He argues the accused brought the items with them. The State has also accused both men of lying in their plea explanations, in which they point fingers at each other. Nigel has pleaded guilty to charges of robbery, while his uncle Johannes has denied any involvement. The State has brought evidence to prove the two men went on a shopping spree after Rust's murder. Rust financially supported Nigel from a young age and played the role of his mentor.
