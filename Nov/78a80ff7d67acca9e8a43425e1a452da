                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament’s inquiry into allegations of state capture at Eskom resumes on Tuesday morning after lawmakers heard from several employees who used to work at the parastatal. The Public Enterprises Portfolio committee is probing allegations of grand corruption, governance failures and mismanagement of state funds at the power utility. At the centre of the storm are the controversial Gupta brothers and their business associates who've benefited from lucrative state contracts. The committee is probing dubious contracts linked to the controversial Gupta family or their associates. They include a R43 million contract with The New Age newspaper and Eskom's role in a Gupta-owned company’s purchase of a coal mine. The spotlight has also focused on the parastatal’s multi-million rand payments to Trillian even though there were no signed contracts in place. Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe’s R30 million pension payout is also under investigation in Parliament.
