                                         JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has filed her answering affidavit on the matter concerning Absa paying back an apartheid bailout. Mkhwebane released the report in June which included the remedial action that the Special Investigating Unit should recover more than R1 billion from Absa. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, Treasury and Absa have challenged the report, saying Mkhwebane failed to conduct a diligent investigation as required by law and the Constitution. Mkhwebane's lawyers have since withdrawn from the case and she has a new legal team. Spokesperson Cleopatra Mosana says Mkhwebane filed her answering affidavit on Friday to the High Court.“It outlines the rationale when she did her investigation whereby she says the money can go towards building houses for people if the money is recovered.” While Mkhwebane has backed down on her proposal that the constitutional mandate of the Reserve Bank be changed, Mosana says the report has been sensationalised. “The issue is not about not recovering the funds. The funds must be recovered.  Also, the court will make that determination and decide what will happen if the money is recovered.” The matter will be back in the High Court on 5 December.
