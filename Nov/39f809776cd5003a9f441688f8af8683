                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Weather Service says it still expects a cold front to touch Gauteng on Wednesday evening, leading to chilly days for the rest of the week. Forecaster Puseletso Mofokeng says temperatures will be in their early 20s and below across the province. He says the weekend would bring much friendlier weather, with temperatures then expected to rise. “Johannesburg will see 17 degrees and Pretoria 20. So, we can expect that just the day after, on Friday, we can expect a bit of a temperature increase. I think the temperature will be back to the mid-20s by the weekend.”
