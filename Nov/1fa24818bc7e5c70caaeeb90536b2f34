                                         CAPE TOWN - Civic group the Social Justice Coalition says using the toilet in an informal settlement is one of the most dangerous activities residents have to do. And with Sunday being World Toilet Day, the SJC hopes to thrust the spotlight on the importance of this basic need yet again. According to the City of Cape Town's website, it provides 100% access to adequate sanitation services in informal settlements.  The municipality adds, though, that it's not possible to install flush toilets in all areas due to several factors, including unstable ground or areas that are "so densely settled that there is no room for water infrastructure." But the SJC's Axolile Notywala says the city isn't doing enough. "The daily struggle of having to fear going to the toilet is a reality in informal settlements. This is what we have been trying to work on and trying to get the City fo Cape Town specifically to improve sanitation services in informal settlements because using a toilet in informal settlements is one of the most dangerous things a person can do."
