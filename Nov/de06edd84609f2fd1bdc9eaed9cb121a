                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has announced its intentions to report Multichoice to the Competition Commission to investigate how the company influenced policy on set-top boxes in favour of their market domination and the involvement of former Communications Minister Faith Muthambi. Muthambi now serves as the Minister of Public Service and Administration. The party was responding to recent reports which suggested that Muthambi worked with the controversial Gupta family to solicit bribes in exchange for protection of Multichoice from competition. The EFF has also urged Parliament to instigate an inquiry into the controversial Gupta family's influence over the former minister. EFF Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says: “We want to condemn what is essentially a corrupt relationship with one of the most widely dominated industry players.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
