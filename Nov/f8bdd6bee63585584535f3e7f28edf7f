                                         JOHANNESBURG - Musa Nyatama scored against his former club Bloemfontein Celtic, to give Orlando Pirates a 1-0 win, and move second behind Baroka FC on the PSL log. The Buccaneers played an enterprising and fast paced game, and created plenty of scoring opportunities, while Celtic where willing to sit back and absorb the pressure and hit Pirates on the counter attack.  Live wire attacker, Thabo Qalinge created the first chance of the game, when he stripped the Celtic defence of the ball only for his shot to go wide of Patrick Tignyembâ€™s goal.  Pirates carried on with their fast-paced tempo to the game in the second half, and they were rewarded when Musa Nyatama put them ahead against his old club. Pirates held on for the 1-0 victory and climb to second on the log, one point adrift from log leaders Baroka FC. Baroka, only managed to salvage a 2-2 draw against Platinum Stars to consolidate their lead.  Saturdays results saw Chippa United and Mamelodi Sundowns fail to score a goal in Port Elizabeth. Champions Bidvest Wits remained at the bottom of the log when they played out to a goalless draw against Maritzburg United, while Kaizer Chiefs and Free State Stars shared the spoils in a 1-1 draw.
