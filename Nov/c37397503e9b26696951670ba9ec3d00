                                         CAPE TOWN - Parliament's Transport Committee says it wants the newly appointed interim board of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) to appear before it, before it goes into recess. On Tuesday, the board members failed to turn up for their first engagement with Parliament since their appointment last month. The board has a number of issues on its plate, including signing-off on the agency's financial statements and dealing with a host of investigations into maladministration and financial mismanagement. There have been a plethora of investigations into the affairs at Prasa, none of which have yielded an outcome. MPs say they are concerned that millions have been spent on investigations that could have been carried out by state agencies. Werksmans Attorneys has been paid R148 million for its investigation, which Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi says is under consideration by the board. “It will be brought here unedited; we have nothing to hide. We are doing our work. We are here to account.” He says criminal cases have been opened as a result of some of the investigations, and legal opinions have been sought on the implications of the investigations into some Prasa officials.
