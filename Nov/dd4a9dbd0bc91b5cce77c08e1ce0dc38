                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department says it has not received any reports of abstenteeism as a result of Wednesday taxi strike. Scores of taxi drivers earlier marched to the transport minister’s office and the Union Buildings in Pretoria, demanding a government subsidy and the removal of Uber from the roads. While the strike was disruptive to traffic and left many commuters stranded, there were minimal effects on learning. The department's Steve Mabona said: “The impact was not that severe in terms of learners who were supposed to be writing their finals examinations. I’m talking about the grade 12 learners, we had about 20 of them who were diverted to alternative centres where they were allowed to write.” WATCH: Striking taxi drivers demand transport minister be fired
