                                         JOHANNESBURG - Exclusive Books says that government agencies cannot simply demand that books be taken off the shelves.  The book store says that it will continue to stand behind author Jacques Pauw and his controversial book The President’s Keepers.  The book claims that President Jacob Zuma failed to submit his tax returns for at least the first five years of his presidency. Exclusive Books maintains the contents are not hateful or harmful, and says that if government authorities have a problem with it, they should take the matter to court. CEO Benjamin Trisk explains: “I will censor a book that is blatantly racist, has hatred of Jews, hatred of black people or any other people. But a book like this, why should we refuse to sell it? Exclusive Books says its task is to sell books which demonstrate different arguments about matters of importance to the South African public. “Part of our task is to sell books that demonstrate and put forward different arguments about matters of importance to the South African public. We believe that The President’s Keepers is just such a book.” Excusive Books says reports that it agreed to recall Pauw's new book are untrue. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
