                                         JOHANNESBURG - The family of murdered model Reeva Steenkamp welcomed the increased sentence of 13 years and five months handed down on Paralympian Oscar Pistorius on Friday and said it showed that justice could prevail in South Africa. “This is an emotional thing for them. They just feel that their trust in the justice system has been confirmed this morning,” Tania Koen, a spokesperson for the Steenkamp family, told Reuters.  The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) went to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) to appeal the sentence handed down by the High Court in Pretoria. The former paralympic superstar shot and killed his girlfriend on Valentine's Day in 2013.  The SCA's decision was a unanimous one - that the NPA should be granted leave to appeal and Pistorius should recieve the maximum possible sentence in this case. However, the court did take into account the time the Pistorius has already served. Judge Willie Seriti handed down the order on behalf of the court. Pistorius may now have to be moved back to the Kgosi Mampuru II prison from the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre.
