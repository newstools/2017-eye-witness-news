                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says the only thing that would save the tripartite alliance is if Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa becomes president of the African National Congress (ANC). Cosatu's Deputy General Secretary Solly Phetoe made the comment while addressing ANC supporters in Mpumalanga where Ramaphosa is speaking to a cadres forum. “The only person who’ll unite the ANC, the alliance and South Africans is comrade Cyril Ramaphosa.” The party's alliance partner the SACP has since taken a decision to contest elections and hasn't ruled out leaving the current alliance. Now, Cosatu seems to be indicating that the only way it will stay in the ANC is if Ramaphosa wins the party's elective conference in December. REVIVAL AND CLEANSING At the same time, the Deputy President says his presidential campaign is about reviving and cleansing the ANC. Ramaphosa says his campaign's vision is clear: “We will cleanse the ANC of all factional tendencies, of all forms of division and corruption.” He says if elected ANC president, the party will come out of the December conference renewed. “We want an ANC that will be focused and a brand-new ANC.”
