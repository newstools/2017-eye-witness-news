                                         CAPE TOWN - Energy expert Chris Yelland says Eskom’s liquidity position continues to decline. Online publication Fin24 is reporting the power utility’s liquidity reserves are expected to fall to R1.2 billion by the end of November compared to a target of R20 billion. Earlier on Tuesday, Eskom's spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe confirmed the company had enough cash to pay wages and keep operations going for a few months. Yelland says the power utility must put measures in place to improve its liquidity. “There’s more money going out than coming in and therefore the liquidity position, which they’ve tried to keep above R20 billion. In other words, the funding, normal operation, salaries, primary energy and maintenance, their liquidity reserves, are dropping.”
