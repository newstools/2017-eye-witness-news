                                         CAPE TOWN - Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe has told MPs that former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela did not ask him for his side of the story when she released her report on state capture. Madonsela’s report which was released late last year shows that Molefe contacted one of the Gupta brothers 44 times and went to Saxonwold, where the family resides, 19 times. These interactions reportedly took place around the time that a Gupta-owned company was preparing to buy Optimum Coal, which it did, with Eskom’s help. Molefe told Parliament’s Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee that Madonsela failed to provide details about his phone records. “Paragraphs 5.97 refers to contact between myself and Mr Ajay Gupta on a number of occasions. The former Public Protector failed to provide any other details about the phone calls. She does not provide the phone numbers nor the dates and times when the phone calls were made.” The lack of clarity, he says, places him in a position where he can neither confirm nor deny the veracity of her claims. Reading from a prepared statement, he pointed to alleged irregularities in Madonsela’s State of Capture report. “This is according to my cellular phone records, which I’ve thoroughly examined since the release of her report.” Molefe is testifying in a parliamentary inquiry into allegations of state capture.
