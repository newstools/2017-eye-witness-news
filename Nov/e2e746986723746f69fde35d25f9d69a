                                            Janusz Walus, imprisoned for the murder of South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani, was denied parole on Friday.


                                         PRETORIA - Justice Minister Michael Masutha says he has rejected convicted murderer Janusz Walus’s parole application because he has not shown remorse and his political ideology remains a risk factor.  Masutha made the announcement  in Pretoria on Friday.   Walus and former Conservative Party MP Clive Derby-Lewis conspired to assassinate former South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani in April 1993. Masutha says a psychological report found Walus felt remorse for the pain caused to Hani’s relatives, but not for murdering him.  “The report demonstrates a person who sees nothing wrong in eliminating a communist who happens to be a father and husband. This can in no way be taken as full remorse as he continues to justify his killing of a communist.” Masutha says the Correctional Services Department will help Walus with further restorative justice programmes.  He says the offender was made aware of his decision on Thursday.  In August the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) upheld Masutha’s appeal against a High Court decision which ordered him to release Walus. He was given three months to make the decision. The minister denied Walus’s parole application in 2015, which was then challenged through the courts and finally referred back to Masutha for a decision. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
