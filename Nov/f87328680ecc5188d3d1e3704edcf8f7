                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says if the situation in Zimbabwe becomes unstable it will be greatly concerning given that the neighbouring country’s affairs have an impact on South Africa. Speaking at Luthuli House earlier on Tuesday ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe made it clear that the ANC doesn’t want to get involved in the rift. “Zanu-PF must deal with that issue because Zimbabwe is not our colony… it’s not our province, it’s our neighbour. If things go wrong there, of course, we’ll be concerned because it’ll impact on us, but we have no authority over them, that’s the point we’re making.” There is uncertainty in Harare, on Tuesday evening, after eyewitnesses reported seeing tanks driving towards the capital. The unexplained troop movements come a day after the country’s defence force commander, Constantine Chiwenga, threatened to step in to end the expulsion of war veterans from the ruling party. Reuters has reported seeing two tanks parked on the side of the road, around 20 kilometres north of the capital. Other eyewitnesses claim they saw more tanks on the same road early on Tuesday afternoon, but those reports have not been verified. Roads in northern Harare on Tuesday afternoon, including the road leading out to Mazowe, appeared calm. Traffic and pedestrians were moving around as normal. But there are heightened political tensions within the ruling party. Youths loyal to President Robert Mugabe hit out at defence force commander Chiwenga in a media conference this morning after he warned the military would not hesitate to step in.
