The National Assembly has begun a marathon final sitting during which the medium-term budget policy statement and the Adjustments Appropriation Bill will be debated. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has accused the African National Congress (ANC) of ramming through the adjustments budget so that its members can campaign ahead of the party’s elective conference next month. The National Assembly has begun a marathon final sitting during which the medium-term budget policy statement and the Adjustments Appropriation Bill will be debated. DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen’s told the house the process has been so rushed there hasn’t been time for MPs to do anything more than accept the executive’s budget proposals. “It is not acceptable that this house is forced to rise and rush through its business in order to meet internal, party deadline. It’s unacceptable.” The ANC has dismissed the accusation.
