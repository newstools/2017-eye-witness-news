                                         JOHANNESBURG - The Constitutional Court must now decide if it will confirm a High Court order on the law around sexual offences or if the legislation must be sent to Parliament for a period of time to be amended.  The court on Tuesday heard an application from the so-called Frankel 8 who have alleged that stockbroker Sydney Frankel sexually abused them decades ago when they were children. The applicants in the case believe that the law should not allow any sexual offender to avoid his day in court. This would see Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act immediately be declared invalid and the 20-year time limit on prosecution for sexual assault lifted.  While the Minister of Justice conceded that the section of the law is unconstitutional, advocate Geoff Budlender argued that Parliament be given 24 months to remedy the constitutional defect.  The High Court had suggested it be given 18 months to do so.  Judgment in this matter has been reserved. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
