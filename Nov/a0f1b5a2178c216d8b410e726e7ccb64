                                         CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says that the development of low-cost housing in Woodstock, Salt River and the City Bowl will contribute to the regeneration of these areas. This comes after a flyer was distributed in Woodstock raising concerns over the plans The city plans to develop affordable housing units at 11 sites. Reclaim the City's Noenyah Adams says that disgruntled Woodstock residents have told activists they're not opposing social housing, but they're concerned about issues like an increase in crime. "Many of them are concerned about the Woodstock hospital site. Their concern is that it will probably be a maximum eight to 10-storey building, so their view will be taken away. So, where they are concerned about their view, we are being rendered homeless. We invited them to our Thursday evening meeting and if we can work it together, we can make it work."
