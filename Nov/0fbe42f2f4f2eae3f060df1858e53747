A 10-year-old boy had been playing with friends on a sand bank of a lagoon in Durban on Saturday.  He was swept into the water when waves washed over the bank. His body was recovered by emergency services personnel. In another incident, a 13-year-old boy, who had been on a school outing also on Saturday, disappeared under water while swimming in the Kleinmond Lagoon. The National Sea Rescue Institute’s Craig Lambinon says, “On arrival on scene no sign of the child was found. National Sea Rescue team went in to try and rescue the teenager.  “Then after doing few meters deeper they located and recovered the body. The body was taken to the forensic pathologist.”
