                                         JOHANNESBURG - Political parties have applauded Zimbabweans for the transition of power without bloodshed, hoping the change will trickle down to South Africa. The Economic Freedom Fighters' Mbuyiseni Ndlozi  says Mugabe's resignation shows he accepted the democratic processes. “Many people in his position are never removed without the spilling of blood. And here he is getting out of power without a single life being lost.”    The Democratic Alliance's Mabine Seabe  says Mugabe’s resignation opens the way for fresh elections. “This is a matter where the will of the people must be registered and ensure that free and fair elections are held.” The Inkatha Freedom Party's Narend Singh says South Africa will also benefit from the change in power. “There are indications that many people who are seeking asylum in South African would return to Zimbabwe to grow the economy.” The Congress of the People has also welcomed Mugabe's co-operation in the violence-free transition. LISTEN: Robert Mugabe’s colourful & controversial political journey  'TURNING POINT' With world leaders reacting to Mugabe's resignation, Britain has described his resignation as a "moment of hope" and a "turning point" for Zimbabwe. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says it's important for free and fair elections to be held next year. “For 37 years they’ve been languishing under the rule of a despot who impoverished their country and what we hope now, is that this will be a turning point.” Johnson also tweeted that he's not pretending to regret Mugabe's downfall. More diplomatically, 10 Downing Street says Zimbabwe is now free to rebuild the economy under a legitimate government.
