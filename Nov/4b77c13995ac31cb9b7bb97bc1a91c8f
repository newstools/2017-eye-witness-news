                                         JOHANNESBURG - There’s been no resolution between Eskom  and its legal head Suzanne Daniels at the CMMA, with the matter now being referred to arbitration. Eyewitness News on Wednesday revealed that the power utility issued Daniels with two completely different charge sheets last month to motivate her suspension. Daniels' internal report - handed to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown - explains Eskom’s relationship with Gupta-linked Trillian and consultancy firm McKinsey.  It also implicates several executives, including suspended Matshela Koko and Anoj Singh. Eskom and Daniels will be back at the CMMA for arbitration. When former CEO Johnny Dladla handed her a letter of intention to suspend her in early October, she responded to the allegations, saying that there's no basis for the suspension. On the same day that CEO Sean Maritz was appointed as CEO, a new charge sheet was drafted and issued to Daniels, stating that she's facing charges of misconduct for not informing the board about the liability in terms of paying McKinsey and Gupta-linked Trillian. Eskom says the initial charge sheet indicated that further charges could be added, and the misconduct charges Daniels faces has nothing to do with her exposing executives accused of irregularities. Daniels maintains that there's no basis for her suspension and that the allegations against her are aimed at discrediting the legal outcomes produced in her pursuit to protect the best interests of the company.
