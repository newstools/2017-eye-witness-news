Minister Michael Masutha says a psychological report revealed Walus has not been rehabilitated. PRETORIA - The South African Communist Party (SACP) has welcomed Justice Minister Michael Masutha’s decision to reject parole for Chris Hani murderer Janusz Walus. The minister made the announcement in Pretoria on Friday. The polish national and former Conservative Party Member of Parliament Clive-Derby Lewis conspired to murder Hani in 1993. The SACP says it welcomes the news that Walus will remain in prison because he has not shown remorse and they believe he has not fully disclosed who was behind the plot to murder Hani. Minister Masutha says a psychological report revealed Walus has not been rehabilitated. “He showed no remorse for murdering Chris Hani, the communist leader. He still rationalises his actions and insists that they were politically motivated. His ideas about communism still stands.” Masutha says that he dealt with Walus’s parole application like he does any other. "In dealing with any matter, I look at what is brought before me and I try to make rational sense of it and that informs the decision that I make." Masutha has recommended Walus attend restorative justice programmes. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
