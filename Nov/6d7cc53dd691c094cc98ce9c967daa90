                                         CAPE TOWN - Sailing and yacht racing enthusiasts are in for a treat at the V&A Waterfront for the next two weeks. The prestigious Volvo Ocean Race is making its stopover in Cape Town. The 13th edition of the iconic race travels to various cities around the world, including Lisbon, Auckland and Cardiff. With all seven teams securely in Cape Town, the racing yachts will now go through mandatory services and repairs ahead of the next leg to Melbourne. This is an opportune time for members of the public to experience what the Volvo Ocean Race is all about at the official Race Village at the Waterfront. With Sustainability and Plastic Free Oceans messaging at its core, the Race Village offers insight into the race, the sailors and the yachts, but also into the current state of our oceans. There is also a 3D presentation which allows visitors to get a genuine experience of how the ocean racers live at sea. The ocean sports programme showcases some of the country's top talents in stand-up paddle boarding, canoe polo and youth sailing. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
