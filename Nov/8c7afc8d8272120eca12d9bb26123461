                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) says that it’s difficult to condemn the actions of the Zimbabwean military given President Robert Mugabe’s abuse of democracy over the years. The Zimbabwean president made his first public appearance on Thursday after being held under house arrest by the army, who have seized power. The army has justified their actions by saying they are targeting criminals around Mugabe. The SACP’s Solly Mapaila says: “It’s difficult to condemn what’s going on after what has been going on for so many decades. The political system had failed, in fact, Mugabe had shown how to abuse democracy. He used a democratic space to admonish and hit all those who didn’t agree with him, he ran a securecratic state.” Earlier on Friday, Botswana President Ian Khama said Mugabe should end his attempts to remain in office as he has no regional diplomatic support to stay in power. “I don’t think anyone should be president for that amount of time. We are presidents, we are not monarchs. It’s just common sense,” Khama said. Mugabe is revered as an elder statesman and member of the generation of Africa’s independence leaders, but he is also viewed by many in Africa as a president who held his country back by remaining in power too long. He calls himself the grand old man of African politics. WATCH: The who and why behind Zimbabwe's military power grab  Additional reporting by Reuters.
