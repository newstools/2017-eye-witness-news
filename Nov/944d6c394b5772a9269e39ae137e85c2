Lekota says his party supports the movement and has called on government to do more to protect farmers. “Protect our farmers, protect farmworkers and protect our rural communities. We want freedom in this country to reign supreme. Anyone who wants to change anything must come to elections.” This follows the nationwide ‘Black Monday’ movement earlier this month which saw people around the country protest.
