                                         CAPE TOWN - The Hawks says that its investigation into the theft of firearms from two Cape Town police stations is still underway. Acting Hawks head Yolisa Matakata briefed Parliament's police portfolio committee on Tuesday on the latest developments in their case. The committee heard that only three of the 33 firearms that went missing from the Mitchells Plain and Bellville police stations have been recovered so far. Officials, about two months ago, started to probe the disappearance of 18 firearms at the Belville South Police Station. In Mitchells Plain, 15 firearms were unaccounted for. Following a community tip-off in September, officers found one of the missing firearms with 13 rounds of ammunition hidden in the backyard of an unoccupied Manenberg residence.  In the same month, officers nabbed a suspect in Belhar for the possession of drugs and a second stolen firearm.The third firearm was found last month when police searched a known gang member, also in Manenberg. He was carrying 10 rounds of ammunition. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
