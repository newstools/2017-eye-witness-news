                                         JOHANNESBURG - It’s premier versus president as Botswana’s government takes a South African politician to task. North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo was on an official visit to Gabarone last week. His blue light motorcade forced its way past president Ian Khama’s official convoy.  The government’s Jeff Ramsay says that Mahumapelo’s security detail did not go through proper security clearance. “It was irregular. It hadn’t followed any protocol, so that’s the main concern. So it wasn’t even about our president but about the fact that there was a blue light motorcade on our roadway at rush hour.” Botswana has lodged an official complaint.
