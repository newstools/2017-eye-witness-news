                                         JOHANNESBURG - Organisations who were in court to support the victims of former Higher Education Deputy Minister Mduduzi Manana  say the magistrate's ruling doesn't discourage society from abusing women. Magistrate Ramsamy Reddy sentenced him to either a year's imprisonment or to pay a fine of R100,000. Manana pleaded guilty to assaulting three women in a Fourways club in August shortly after the video of the assault went viral. Despite the seriousness of the crime, Magistrate Reddy says he has had to take into consideration the fact that Manana showed remorse. However, the Economic Freedom Fighters’ Mandisa Mashigo says the court has sent the wrong message to society. “So the message that is sent out is that if a man is wealthy and he has some kind of standing in society he can basically rape, kill, murder, burn, lynch any black woman he wants to.” Organisation #NotInMyName's Siya Jentile says they will continue supporting the victims. “But as a civil society group, we are saying we are still focusing on giving support, especially to the victims.” Manana is expected to settle his R100,000 fine by noon on Tuesday and compensate the victims in seven days.
