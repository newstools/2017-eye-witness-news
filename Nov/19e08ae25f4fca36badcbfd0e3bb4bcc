Cape Town's Ashley Haigh-Smith is excited to be taking his Olsbergs MSE Ford Fiesta through its paces this weekend. “It’s faster than a formula one car off the start line, 0 to 100.9 seconds is amazing, everything about it is handled so well.” Pretoria's Mark Cronje says he's aim is to at least reach the semi-finals. “The car is an absolute beast it, makes around just under 700 horse power, it's exceptionally quick, its four-wheel drive. It’s got a lodge control. It really is an animal to drive.”  World Rallycross Champion for 2017, Johan Kristoffersson says he's delighted the event is being hosted in Cape Town.
