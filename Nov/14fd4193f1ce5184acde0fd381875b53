CAPE TOWN - Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa says he doesn’t expect any disputes over the outcome of the African National Congress (ANC)’s elective conference. Speaking to journalists in Parliament on Thursday morning, Ramaphosa says he has no doubt that the ANC’s branches will accept whoever is chosen to lead the party and so will he. Leadership disputes have landed up in court in three provinces. Most recently, a High Court ruled that the ANC’s Free State provincial conference can’t go ahead until branch general meetings are done over. There’s also a court battle today in Pietermaritzburg where the KwaZulu-Natal ANC is applying for leave to appeal a September ruling which nullified the provincial executive. The recent Eastern Cape elective conference is also being appealed. Despite the drama, Ramaphosa says that the conference will go ahead. “For instance, with the Free State, my understanding of that court judgment is that it deals with their process towards holding a provincial conference.” Ramaphosa also spoke about his recent meeting with the president and other ANC presidential hopefuls. “And the message was the same even in that meeting. Let us make sure that we hold an orderly conference, let us make sure that everything with regard to the conference goes well. So I’m hopeful that the conference will go ahead without any hitch, without any doubt.”
