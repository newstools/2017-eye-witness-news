The much-anticipated announcement is expected on Wednesday. The South African bid has been named as the “clear leader” and “unanimous” choice of the Rugby World Cup board to host the 2023 tournament. The country is competing against France and Ireland which have been rated second and third respectively. Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Tyrone Seale said: “Ramaphosa met the team in September, where it presented its case for 2023 tournament. The final decision rests with 26 World Rugby Council members who collectively exercise 39 votes and among whom a simple majority is required to secure a hosting right.”
