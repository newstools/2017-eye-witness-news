                                         JOHANNESBURG - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has asked Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) to conduct an urgent public review of the regulations that allow MultiChoice and other subscription broadcasters to carry SABC 1, 2 and 3, free of charge.  The SABC has argued that the regulations have had a serious impact on the broadcaster from a potential revenue point of view.  The industry’s Must Carry Regulations passed in 2008 have ensured that all subscription broadcasters with more than 30 channels carry the three SABC channels for free.  The SABC claims its three channels are among the most watched on DStv.  The corporation’s general manager for the regulatory affairs Philly Moilwa said: “The regulations became in concrete with the law and they’re supposed to be subjected to the main legislation. So, we’re asking Icasa to review these regulations because we cannot properly engage with MultiChoice with this kind of an incomplete situation.”
