                                         JOHANNESBURG - Police at the Sunnyside Police Station have refused to drop charges of assault against a suspect even though his alleged victim asked them to. A woman tried to withdraw a case of assault against her husband in Pretoria on Monday afternoon. The police's Daniel Mavimbela said: “An offence that requires the immediate removal of an alleged perpetrator from the scene into police custody and that is not negotiable. The suspect appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court this afternoon and the case was postponed to Wednesday.” The country is currently observing 16 days of no violence against women and children.
