                                         CAPE TOWN - A Philippi mother is celebrating a dual miracle on Friday afternoon. She gave birth to her baby boy earlier this morning in the middle of Cape Town peak hour traffic. Alicia Mbovane lay on a hospital bed at Mowbray Maternity, with tears rolling down her cheeks. On her chest was a tiny baby boy who was fast asleep. He's her Friday miracle. She started having contractions late on Thursday night, but she thought it was a false alarm. Speaking through an interpreter, she told Eyewitness News she and her husband realised in the morning that the baby was not waiting around. “But this morning it was severe and then they asked the husband’s friend to come with them. And then on their way it was severe pain, it was serious.” They rushed to the hospital. But on their way there, they were stuck in traffic.  As luck would have it, a traffic officer was also an experienced midwife. Amanda Fojo  assessed the situation, realised they'd never make it to the hospital on time and delivered the baby right there and then on the side of the N2. Mbovane and her baby boy are doing well, she says she will forever be grateful for officer Fojo's help in the delivery of her baby boy.  The Mbovanes have not yet chosen a name for their baby boy. As for the heroic traffic officer, she went right back to work after delivering him.__WATCH: Surprise delivery on Cape Town's N2 highway
