                                         JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says its special national executive committee meeting next week will discuss issues related to its upcoming elective conference that need urgent attention.  The party decided to convene the special meeting, saying that the key issue on the agenda will be secretary-general Gwede Mantashe’s organisational report which must be finalised before the December conference. As the ANC draws nearer to its elective conference next month, it’s forced to deal with countless court cases by its own members, allegations of fake membership and disputes around the branch general meetings that are currently underway, nominating leaders for positions. ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says these and many other issues will be discussed. “The secretary-general or the officials may want to discuss issues relevant to the national conference which may need urgent attention of the national executive committee.” He says that the Eastern Cape ANC’s congress that turned violent last month may also be on the agenda.
