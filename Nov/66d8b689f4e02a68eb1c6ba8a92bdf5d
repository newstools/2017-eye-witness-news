                                         JOHANNESBURG - An Egyptian bridegroom has been seriously injured after he was hit by shotgun pellets fired into his testicles by a guest celebrating his wedding. Reports of the incident have provoked a call for the tradition of firing gunshots in public celebration to be banned. In addition to the wounds to his genitals, the bridegroom, who is being treated in hospital, suffered serious injuries to his thigh and hand. Osman al-Alsaied, whoâ€™s 28, was enjoying his last night being single when the weapon was accidentally fired at him rather than into the air. Police say the gun was negligently fired by a 26-year-old man who fled the scene but was later arrested and questioned.
