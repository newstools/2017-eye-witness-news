                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has expressed concern over Britain’s excitement about changes to Zimbabwe’s leadership. After Robert Mugabe resigned on Tuesday, reaction poured in from the international community, including the country’s former colonial ruler, which greeted the news with an offer of support. Mantashe has caution against accepting this kind of assistance. “Declaration by an ambassador of a western country to say ‘now we’ll help Zimbabwe’. Help Zimbabwe with what? Where was help all this time?” British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday that Mugabe’s resignation gave Zimbabwe the chance to forge a new path, free from oppression. “The resignation of Robert Mugabe provides Zimbabwe with an opportunity to forge a new path free of the oppression that characterised his rule,” May said. “In recent days, we have seen the desire of the Zimbabwean people for free and fair elections and the opportunity to rebuild the country’s economy under a legitimate government.” May added in a statement that Britain, as “Zimbabwe’s oldest friend”, would do all it could to support the country. Britain wants Zimbabwe to re-join the international community following the resignation of Robert Mugabe, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday. “We want to see that country re-joining the international community,” May told parliament.
