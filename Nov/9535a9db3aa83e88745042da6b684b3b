                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it's confident that the entire Medupi project will be completed by 2021 if it doesn't experience any further delays. The power utility on Tuesday announced that it has linked unit four of the power station, a rare example of a project that’s been completed ahead of time. This unit was scheduled for completion in July next year. Construction has been marred by delays, but Eskom says that the entire project should be completed by 2021. Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe says that three of the six units have now been connected to the grid. “We are halfway through the completion of the power station. We are confident we’ll make the deadline of 2021 if nothing happens. For example, previously we had problems with contractors and there was industrial action as well.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
