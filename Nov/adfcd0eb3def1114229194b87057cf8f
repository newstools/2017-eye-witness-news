                                         CAPE TOWN - Traffic officers have arrested a taxi driver who was 13 times over the legal blood-alcohol limit in Heideveld. The arrest was made during a roadblock along Duinefontein Road earlier on Monday. Sixteen passengers were inside the minibus taxi that was travelling en route to the city centre. Traffic services' Richard Coleman says another taxi driver apprehended in Bellville on Sunday was also found to have been driving under the influence of alcohol. “Officers on their way home were flagged down by a member of the public who informed them of a taxi driving badly. The officers stopped the vehicle and conducted a sobriety test registering 1.77 milligrams per 1,000 millilitres of breath. One of the highest readings ever seen.”
