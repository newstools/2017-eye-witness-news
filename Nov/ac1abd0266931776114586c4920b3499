                                         PRETORIA - Justice Minister Michael Masutha has recommended that Chris Hani's murderer Janusz Walus attend restorative justice programmes with the aim of rehabilitation. Masutha made the comments in Pretoria on Friday where he announced his decision to reject Walus’s application for parole.  The Polish national and former Conservative Party MP Clive Derby-Lewis conspired to murder the South African Communist Party leader in 1993.  Masutha says there is a need for Walus to attend therapeutic programmes with social workers to enhance his social functioning skills.  “The focus of the programmes should be on his assertiveness, decision-making skills, beliefs and behavioural patterns that leads to aggression.” Masutha says Walus has not shown full remorse because he justifies killing Hani on the basis that he was a communist.  He says another offender profile of Walus should be submitted to him within the next 12 months. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
