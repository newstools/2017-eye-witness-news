                                         JOHANNESBURG - Bafana Bafana midfielder Bongani Zungu will miss the first 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier against Senegal in Polokwane on 10 November, but he will be available for the return leg against the same Senegal in Dakar on 14 November. The France-based player was red-carded in South Africa’s World Cup qualifier against Burkina Faso in October. The matter was taken up by the Fifa Disciplinary Committee (DC) who decided against imposing a further ban on the midfielder, except to fine him. “Zungu is suspended for one match, including automatic suspension, after breaching Fifa Disciplinary Code during a match against Burkina Faso,” said Fifa in a statement. This will be good news to Bafana Bafana head coach Stuart Baxter who had included Zungu in his 25-man squad to face Senegal in back-to-back qualifiers, pending the Fifa DC outcome.
