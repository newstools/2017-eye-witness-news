                                         JOHANNESBURG - SpaceX has postponed the launch of a secretive United States (US) government payload known as Zuma, a mission whose nature and the agency behind it remains a mystery. According to news agency AFP, the aerospace manufacturer headed by South Africa-born billionaire entrepreneur, Elon Musk, abandoned the mission two hours before the planned launch window was to open. SpaceX is no stranger to national security launches.  Earlier this year the California-based company launched a spy satellite for an agency of the US state department and a space plane for the air force.
