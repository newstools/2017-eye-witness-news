Four designers have created fantasy dresses that can be seen in the Saks Fifth Avenue windows as a tribute to 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. NEW YORK - The beloved Disney classic Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs is celebrating its 80th anniversary with a spectacular display in one of New York’s most prestigious store windows. Four renowned designers have created one-of-a-kind fairy-tale gowns for Snow White if she’d lived in the 21st century. Designers Alberta Ferretti, Naeem Khan, Monique Lhuillier, and Marchesa have created fantasy dresses that can be seen in the Saks Fifth Avenue windows as a tribute to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Khan says it’s a cherished opportunity. “As a little boy, when I was in school, Disney characters were part of my education. Snow White in particular… her classic shape of clothes she wears, which is a kind of relevant event today.” The window displays part of the kick-off to the tourist attraction holiday season in New York.
