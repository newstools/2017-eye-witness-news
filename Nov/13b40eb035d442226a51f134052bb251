                                         ABIDJAN - A joint task force has been set up to tackle slavery in Libya. It's a central theme at the African Union-European Union summit underway in the Ivory Coast. More than 80 leaders from Africa and Europe have gathered in Abidjan. The African Union, European Union and United Nations have agreed to put in place a joint task force to what they say is to “save and protect lives of migrants and refugees along the routes and in particularly inside Libya”. Several African nations have repatriated their citizens following revelations of slavery in the North African nation, but the task force will also look to accelerate this process and resettle those in need of international protection.  It will also work closely with Libyan authorities to intensify the dismantling of traffickers and criminal networks, and instead tackle the root causes of migration. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
