                                         JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe’s axed vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa has reportedly gone into hiding after receiving death threats. Mnangagwa was fired by President Robert Mugabe this week after being accused of fanning factionalism in Zanu-PF and plotting to overthrow the 93-year-old. Local media organisations are reporting that the vice president has sought refuge in a private home after being threatened by former state security agents. It’s understood Mnangagwa went into hiding after his attempts to flee to South Africa failed.  Movement for Democratic Change deputy president Nelson Chamisa says Mugabe’s rule has been characterised by victimisation. “You can imagine if this is possible on a former vice president, what more of ordinary citizens? We have had disappearances in the country, journalist Itai Dzamara has not been accounted for.” Chamisa says while internal turmoil within Zanu-pf plays out in their favour, it impacts badly of the country.
