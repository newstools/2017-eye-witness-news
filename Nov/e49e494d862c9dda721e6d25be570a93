Gauteng’s former Director of Mental Health Dr Makgabo Manamela has been suspended for her role in the Esidimeni tragedy. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng’s former Director of Mental Health Doctor Makgabo Manamela is expected to testify at the Esidimeni arbitration hearings in two weeks’ time after being subpoenaed on an urgent basis. Manamela has been suspended for her role in the Esidimeni tragedy in which 141 psychiatric patients died. The patients were moved after the Health Department terminated its contract with the Life Esidimeni group allegedly to save money. Manamela has been mentioned several times at the hearings as the official who forced NGO owners to take patients without the adequate qualifications and signed off on the unlawful licenses. She was also the official named as being present when patients were moved from Esidimeni facilities to the ill-equipped NGOs. Section 27 lawyer Adila Hassin says she has been subpoenaed to testify soon. “The subpoena was issued on 2 November and the date in which Dr Manamela is required to appear is 20 November. We’ve has no objection or challenge to the subpoena thus far.” Recently, an independent ad hoc tribunal headed by retired judge president Bernard Ngoepe dismissed Manamela’s appeal against the health ombudsman’s findings against her. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says she should now be reported to the nurse’s counsel for ethical misconduct. WATCH: Esidimeni arbitration hearing resumes  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
