                                         JOHANNESBURG - NGO Equal Education has won a court battle against the KwaZulu Natal (KZN) Education Department  forcing it to provide scholar transport to 12 rural schools in Nquthu. Around 4,000 pupils have been forced to walk several kilometres to get to school, affecting their ability to learn and sometimes putting their safety at risk. Equal Education's lawyers and those representing the department settled in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday. The NGO's Ntuthuzo Ndzomo says the department has been pleading poverty for too long. “The department is forced to provide scholar transport to the 12 schools that we were representing as Equal Education. But not only that, we had raised issues about the provincial policy for scholar transport in KZN and that means that they need to come with a plan by 1 April 2018.” Meanwhile, the KZN Education Department says it has noted the judgment and will study its findings. #ScholarTransport [WATCH] #EqualEducation's Ntuthuzo Ndzo says they have been fighting this battle with KZN education since last year .
