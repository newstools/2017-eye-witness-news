                                         TEHRAN - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that Russia regarded an attack in New York that killed eight people as tragic and inhumane and sent its condolences to the people of the United States. An Uzbek immigrant accused of carrying out the attack by driving a rental truck down a riverfront bike path on Tuesday appeared to have acted alone, but the Halloween Day attack had all the hallmarks of terrorism, authorities said. Peskov was speaking in Iran during a visit there by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Uzbekistan was part of the Soviet Union until its collapsed in 1991. The incident marked the greatest loss of life from a suspected terrorist attack in New York since suicide hijackers crashed jetliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan on 11 September 2001, killing more than 2,600 people. Tuesday’s assault, on the far west side of lower Manhattan a few blocks from the site of the World Trade Center, was reminiscent of several deadly vehicle attacks in Europe during the past 15 months. Multiple media outlets, including CNN, reported that the suspect shouted “Allahu Akbar” - Arabic for “God is greatest” - when he jumped out of his truck, citing police officials.
