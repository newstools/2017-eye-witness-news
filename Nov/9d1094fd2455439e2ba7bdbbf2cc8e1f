                                         CAPE TOWN - Energy Minister David Mahlobo is adamant that the government will go ahead with its plans for more nuclear power. This is despite Finance Minister Malusi Gigagba saying the proposed 9.6 gigawatt nuclear build programme is unaffordable and unnecessary right now. Mahlobo on Tuesday met with parliament’s energy committee.  The minister says that the decision on more nuclear power still stands. “Cabinet took a decision to procure nuclear. Cabinet has not gone back and changed that decision.” Mahlobo says he wants the revised integrated resource plan, which maps the country’s energy needs into the future, to go before Cabinet as soon as possible. This will pave the way for a fresh procurement process to begin. Mahlobo has hinted that the IRT might not indicate that 9.6 gigawatts of nuclear is needed, but rather a lesser amount. He deflected MPs’ attempts to pin him down on costs. “Costing must not be selective, it must be from point A to point Z. But this is where we intervene, I am not going to speak about a figure of a trillion I’ve not spoken to.”
