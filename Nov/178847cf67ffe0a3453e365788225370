JOHANNESBURG - Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa says the National Development Plan’s goal to have a minimum life expectancy of 70 years is achievable. The MEC was part of birthday celebrations for 106-year-old Makwena Mabitsela in Atteridgeville on Saturday. She has urged South Africans to lead healthy lifestyles in their quest for a longer life. Ramokgopha says Mabitsela is an inspiration. “I tried to hold a mic for her and she said no, she’ll hold it herself. She’s an example of what is possible in terms of longevity.”
