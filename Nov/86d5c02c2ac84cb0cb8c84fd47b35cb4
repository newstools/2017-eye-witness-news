                                         JOHANNESBURG - Cab-hailing service Uber has downplayed the possible impact of a massive data breach, which has compromised the personal information of 57 million of its clients globally. Uber made the announcement on its website on Wednesday, but the breach took place sometime last year. Company chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi says they are changing the way they do business and putting integrity at the core of their decisions. Uber has confirmed that rider information such as names, email addresses and cellphone numbers of 57 million users were hacked. However, the company says there's no evidence to suggest that credit card or bank account details were breached. Uber says its users do not need to take any action because they have not seen any fraud or misuse of the data. They are, however, monitoring the affected accounts and have flagged them for additional fraud protection. Uber South Africa says it’s not commenting on the matter because it's being handled by its head office. Read below a statement from Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, acknowledging the breach and cover-up.
