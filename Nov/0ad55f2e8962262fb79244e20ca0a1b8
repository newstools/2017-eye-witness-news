                                         JOHANNESBURG - Ajax Cape Town defender Mario Booysen says that they are eager to inflict more pain on SuperSport United, when the two sides meet in a PSL encounter at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit on Wednesday night.   The Urban Warriors will be keen on grabbing all three points, after a 2-2 draw against AmaZulu over the weekend, a match that they could have closed out for a win, after letting in two goals in injury time.  Booyen though says that the team is confident that the AmaZulu result is behind them, and are focusing on SuperSport.  “We didn’t do well in the last stages of the Amazulu game and we have put that behind us now. We know SuperSport will be hurting from the CAF Confed final loss and will be keen on rectifying that in the league but we're just going to focus on ourselves and get the win.” The two sides are sitting on 13th and 14th position respectively, with only one point separating them, and a win for either side would make sure that they move up the log.  The game kicks off at 7:30pm at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit.
