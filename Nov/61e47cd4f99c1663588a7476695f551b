                                         BATANGAFO - Amid persistent tensions in the Central African Republic (CAR), relief aid groups have been kept busy helping refugees. Medical charity, Doctors Without Borders, treats up to 50 children a day in the town of Batangafo. It’s one of the several towns hit hard by fresh fighting between rebel groups. Louise Soubama sat outside her makeshift home nothing more than a plastic covered hut. Her face is lined with her struggles of her 69 years. She’s one of the people who’ve been forced to abandon almost everything she owns and flee her home. She speaks to Eyewitness News via double translation telling her story in her home language, Sangho, which a medical officer translates into French and an MSF staffer translates into English. She believes she will die without ever having seen that home again. “Once they heard the gunshots, they ran out of the house, leaving everything.” Soubama's story is tragically familiar. The United Nations says over 100,000 CAR residents have been displaced by violence, with 19,000 fleeing to the DRC.   (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
