The SACP’s Solly Mapaila admitted to Eyewitness News that going head-to-head with is alliance partner was tough. JOHANNESBURG - Despite claims of irregularities and vote rigging in the Metsimaholo Municipality by-elections, Local Government Minister Des Van Rooyan who was overseeing the process has told Eyewitness News that all went well. The South African Communist Party (SACP) contested the by-elections for the first time, going head to head with the African National Congress (ANC). The elections came after the municipality’s former coalition government between the Democratic Alliance, Economic Freedom Fighters, the Freedom Front Plus and the Metsimaholo Civic Association was dissolved in July after the mayor from the MCA defected to the ANC. The SACP’s Solly Mapaila admitted to Eyewitness News that going head-to-head with is alliance partner was tough. “It’s very tough but it’s okay because I think it’s about reaffirming our own values.” Mapaila claimed that there were irregularities in the voting process. The chair of the inter-ministerial committee on elections Van Rooyan said on Wednesday that everything was going well. “Starting from how the special votes were conducted, I mean really democracy is at play and this is very interesting.” The ANC has urged the SACP to bring evidence of vote rigging or refrain from making claims the party can’t prove.
