                                         JOHANNESBURG - Lawyer and marijuana activist Garreth Prince is confident that the Constitutional Court will uphold the findings of Western Cape High Court, which ruled in favour of private cannabis usage.  The State is challenging the ruling. The State's council Thomas Bokaba argued on Tuesday that the Western Cape High Court's ruling didn't consider the negative impact that cannabis has on society. However, Dagga Party leader Jeremy Acton said that the ruling was a step in the right direction in justifying his rights as an adult user. Prince believes the court will rule in favour of users. “We are quite confident that the Constitutional Court will affirm the findings of the Western Cape High Court, that the challenge's provisions are unconstitutional and that they need to change.”   The Constitutional Court has reserved its judgement and says it will make a ruling soon.
