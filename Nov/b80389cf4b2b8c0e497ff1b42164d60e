                                         CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says delegates representing their branches at the party’s elective conference in December, should put the interests of South Africans first. Mantashe was the main speaker at the party’s Western Cape Provincial General Council meeting in Cape Town earlier on Sunday. He has been frank in his discussion with delegates, saying a concerted effort needs to be taken to revitalise the party’s image in the public domain. “The image eradication of the ANC where the party is seen equal to corruption, looting nepotism.” Mantashe says one priority is that corruption needs to be eradicated. He says the needs of South Africans should be top-of-mind when delegates choose leaders at next month's conference. “When you loot state resources, when we’re saying we’re stealing from the government, the reality is that you’re not stealing from the government but from the poor. You are limiting the capacity of the state to deliver services.” Delegates will this afternoon finalise branch nominations that will represent the Western Cape at next month’s ANC elective conference.
