                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa is confident a new intervention team will help clean up the various crises facing the department. The four-member team announced by the Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi on Sunday will focus on issues including procurement human resources and improving service delivery at public healthcare facilities. The Gauteng Health Department has been rocked by scandals, including the deadly Esidimeni transfers disaster. Following the Health Ombudsman’s recommendations, the province has been working closely with the national office to ensure that the public health system in Gauteng functions optimally. Ramokgopa says that many inconsistencies in the health system have been exposed by the Life Esidimeni tragedy and they are now working to fix the problems. “If we don’t hold accountable those in the leadership, those in the service, we’re likely to have problems like the ones we’ve had with the Life Esidimeni tragedy.”
