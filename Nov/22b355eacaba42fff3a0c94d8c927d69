                                         CAPE TOWN - The greatest predictor of stability and resilience to conflict is gender equality. That’s according to the deputy general secretary of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed.  Mohammed was the keynote speaker at this year’s annual Nelson Mandela Lecture in Cape Town on Saturday.  She says women’s participation in peace processes in conflict zones increases the sustainability of peace by 30% over the long term. Mohammed, who hails from Nigeria, said her family would not have been allowed in South Africa during the apartheid era as her mother was white and her father black.  The former Cabinet minister, appointed deputy secretary general of the UN in January, told the audience that gender equality was central to Madiba’s vision of equality and to the struggle for freedom. “As Madiba so often said, the struggles succeeded thanks to the bravery and sacrifice of thousands of nameless individuals, who stood up to the racist ideology of apartheid and gave their lives to the cause. We must honour this legacy.” She added that this was the result of women’s unity and their fighting spirit.  It was also a reflection of his leadership that Mandela understood that equality cannot be selectively applied. This was received by loud cheers from the audience. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
