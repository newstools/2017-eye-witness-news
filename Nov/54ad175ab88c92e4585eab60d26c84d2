                                         PRETORIA - Trade union Solidarity says that Eskom meeting minutes have revealed that former chief executive Brian Molefe not only participated in the meeting to decide on his R30 million pension pay-out, he never recorded a conflict of interest as required.  The details were disclosed at a briefing in Centurion on Thursday where the organization discussed its litigation strategy against Molefe and the utility’s board.  Solidarity will approach the High Court in Pretoria next week to set aside Molefe’s pension. It further alleges that the decision to award the pension amounts to criminal conduct. Solidarity’s Anton van der Bijl says at a people’s and governance committee meeting, all the parties, including Brian Molefe, were asked to declare if they had any specific interest in the agenda item.  "The only point on that specific agenda was the pension carve out of Mr Molefe. One would have assumed that he would have declared that he has an interest, yet he didn't do so, as can be clearly seen in the minutes from that meeting." The Eskom documents that Solidarity has obtained reveal that Molefe was not a permanent employee, did not pay any contributions towards the pension fund and was therefore not entitled to his R30 million pension.  The union believes Molefe and the board have made themselves guilty of fraud.
