                                         JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Police Commissioner Deliwe de Lange says most of the repeat crime offenders in the province are illegal immigrants.   De Lange and her team presented the 2016/2017 crime statistics in the provincial legislature on Tuesday. She revealed that murder has increased by 6.7% while attempted murder went up by 6.5%. De Lange says that while they are doing all they can, there’s evidence of corruption by senior officers at some stations. “Without being xenophobic, most or some of our suspects are foreign nationals repeatedly. But we’re winning and we’re having a good relationship with our courts now and most of the suspects that we’ve arrested are not coming back.”
