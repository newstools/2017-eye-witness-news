                                         CAPE TOWN - As Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa goes into the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference next month as a leading contender, his involvement in the events that led up to the Marikana massacre still hangs over his head. But Ramaphosa says he's acutely aware that it's a matter that still requires his attention. Thirty-four mineworkers were gunned down by police during an unprotected strike at Lonmin’s platinum mine in the North West in August 2012. Ramaphosa says it’s untrue that he has not tried to reach out to the communities affected by the Marikana massacre. He says discussions and engagements are ongoing to do precisely that. “I think the timing in this matter, which is a hurtful matter which has brought a lot of pain to a number of people, is of the essence.” Ramaphosa says the matter is being addressed at various levels and includes the issue of compensation for the victims’ families. “As for myself, it’s not a matter that I’ve swept under the carpet. It’s a matter that I know needs to be addressed and timing is the important thing that one needs to look at here.” WATCH: Ramaphosa: Timing in Marikana matter is of the essence
