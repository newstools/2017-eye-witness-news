                                         JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize says that economic development programmes must include rural communities in order to ensure that they participate in the agenda of radical economic transformation. Mkhize is part of a government delegation that’s launched an investment company for over 800 traditional leaders in Johannesburg. The entity was created after a series of talks between the government and traditional leaders. Mkhize says that the initiative will enable the rural community to participate in the economy. “This gives us an opportunity to deal with radical economic transformation beyond statements and slogans to a practical level.” #TraditionalLeaders [WATCH] ANC TG Zweli Mkhize brief media on the launch of the traditional leaders investment company.
