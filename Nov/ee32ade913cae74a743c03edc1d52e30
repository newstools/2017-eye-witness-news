                                         JOHANNESBURG - The University of Bedfordshire in the United Kingdom has released a statement confirming its decision to suspend former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu from the global banking school. Although an independent institute, the school is affiliated with the university and offers an MBA programme in banking. Mahlangu signed off on the Esidimeni project which resulted in the deaths of 141 mentally ill patients. In a statement, University of Bedfordshire spokesperson Ulrika Meegolla confirms that Mahlangu was studying at the Global Banking School. Meegolla says given the severity of the allegations against her in South Africa, Mahlangu has been suspended from her studies at the Global Banking School, on a without prejudice basis. Mahlangu led the process to relocate over 1,700 mentally ill patients from Life Esidimeni facilities to ill-equipped NGOs. She has been subpoenaed on an urgent basis to testify at the arbitration hearing into the Esidimeni tragedy. Her testimony is expected to be heard early next month. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
