                                         JOHANNESBURG - Former Finance Minister and African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Pravin Gordhan says he believes the economy could be put back on track if Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is elected ANC president. Gordhan is a panelist at The Daily Maverick’s The Gathering in Sandton on Thursday. He says the December conference has the power to change the country for better or worse. “I didn’t say he’s going to win, I said I want him to win.” Responding to moderator Stephen Grootes, Gordhan made his allegiance clear; he supports Ramaphosa to take over at the ANC. “But above all what he is saying at the general level is that we require new leadership. Current leadership in the country has failed us because it’s preoccupation has been how to fill certain people’s bank accounts.” He says Ramaphosa’s plans will grow the economy. Gordhan says Ramaphosa’s new deal should not, however, be confused with the Democratic Alliance’s policies.     (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
