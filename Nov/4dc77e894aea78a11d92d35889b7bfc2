                                         CAPE TOWN - The Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) says it's ready to issue a request for proposal to build the country's next nuclear power plant. But board chair Kelvin Kemm insists no deal has been sealed. He's told Parliament's energy committee that Necsa has received 38 responses to its request for information to assist in building a new nuclear plant. Necsa chair Kelvin Kemm says it's waiting for political heads to give the green light to take the next step in the process to build a new nuclear power station. He says it's a misconception that a ruling by the Western Cape High Court  setting aside five cooperation agreements puts the brakes on the nuclear build programme. “The technical type work is continuing and now we have to wait for the political authorities to make a decision on what the move is next.” Kemm says only once a request for proposal is issued, will the true value of the project be known, but he believes the much spoken about a trillion rand price tag, is overestimated.
