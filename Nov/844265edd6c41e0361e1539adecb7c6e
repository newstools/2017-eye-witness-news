                                         JOHANNESBURG - Eskom  says management will be able to verify the coal supply situation at its Hendrina Power Station in Mpumalanga by next week but insists load shedding is not a risk for the moment. In an amaBhungane exclusive, it's been revealed that Guptas-owned Tegeta threatened to cut supply because it wants Eskom to increase the amount it pays for coal. Leaked minutes of an Eskom meeting last Friday, reveal managers were warned that the Hendrina Power Station could be forced to shut down. Alternatively, they'd have to use expensive open cycle gas turbines or make peace with load shedding. If Eskom has a coal stockpile of less than 20 days, there could be complications and the utility has threatened to take legal action. Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe says they are still receiving coal but not as much as usual. “Eskom has asked the primary energy division and people who are running the power station to go into the stock yard and verify how many days of stockpiles do we have, they will come back in due course. But if it’s less than 20 days then clearly it is in contravention of the code.”
