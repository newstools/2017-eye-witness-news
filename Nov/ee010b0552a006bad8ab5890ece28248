                                         JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng police commissioner Deliwe De Lange says the 2016/2017 crime stats show an increase in murder and attempted murder in the province. De Lange and her team have presented the annual crime stats to the Community Safety Committee in the provincial legislature. She also reported the worst performing police stations in the province, which included Edenvale and Akasia in Tshwane. De Lange says the province contributed 28.2% to the national crime figure. Reporting on the statistics was provincial crime registrar Brigadier Mpho Chakalane, who says that out of the seven main contact crime offences, four increased. “Murder, attempted murder, total robbery, aggravating and social offences had an increase." Murder increased by 6.7%, attempted murder by 6.5% and sexual offences by 0.6%. De Lange has revealed a decrease in rape cases but an increase in cases of other forms of sexual assault in the province. Chakalane read out the stats which show the total of sexual offences increased by 0.6% over the past financial year. “Looking at the breakdown of the sexual offences it's only sexual assault rate that had an increase over the period. And just to bear in mind, attempted rape, in this case, is represented as sexual offences.”
