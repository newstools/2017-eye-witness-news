                                         JOHANNESBURG - Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) says there needs to be an urgent commitment to the broader economic crisis to avoid more downgrades. Standard & Poor’s Global has lowered South Africa's ratings due to a weakening economic and fiscal trajectory. The agency has lowered the country's long-term local currency credit rating to BB+ from BBB-, moving it into sub-investment grade. This means both its ratings are now in junk state status with the foreign currency rating two notches below junk. However, the outlook on both now stands at stable. BLSA says strict fiscal discipline by government should take relieving the country off the current downgrades. COO Busi Mavuso says more needs to be done to stabilise the economy. “There needs to be good governance around SOEs (state-owned enterprises). We shouldn’t be surprised that we've been downgraded, because we failed to address all the things we were requested to address by ratings agencies.” Meanwhile, ratings agency Moody’s has decided to keep its rating unchanged and says it will wait until the ANC elective conference next month and the budget in February next year. Economist Hugo Pienaar says it is now going to be critical that the February budget by the Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba, shows a firm commitment to consolidating the budget over time. “If we can do that, we may prevent a Moody’s downgrade, but this will take quite a bit of hard work for us to prevent that.” Moody's has both local and foreign currency debt one notch above junk. Treasury says South Africa is still included in the World Bond Indexes, which is good news as this would have seen a broad sell off. The rand, however, lost around 25 cents to the dollar after the announcement. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
