                                         JOHANNESBURG - Springbok forwards coach Matthew Proudfoot  says that the Boks will not take the Irish lightly when the two sides clash at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Saturday. Ireland stunned the Boks in the first of three tests last year in South Africa, and Proudfoot says they have learnt from the last time the two sides met. “We had a very tough three-test series against Ireland last June and if you ask the Irish coaches they’ll feel like we got away with one in that series. We took lessons out of that series and we have learnt from them” says Proudfoot. Proudfoot also says that the Boks will look to play at the same intensity as they did against the All Blacks  in their last test. “We don’t look at other teams and say we will play at 50% because we have played against the All Blacks, we look to bring the same intensity to every game no matter the opposition.” Meanwhile, the game against Ireland will be assistant coach Johann van Graan’s second last game with the national set-up before he takes up his role as head coach of Irish club rugby giants Munster on 19 November.
