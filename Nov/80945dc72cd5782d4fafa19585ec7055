The ANC placed the motion on Thursday's agenda, hoping to remove Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and Speaker Vasco da Gama from office. JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) members marching in support of Joburg's mayor have arrived at the city council offices in Braamfontein ahead of a vote of no confidence in Herman Mashaba. The African National Congress (ANC) placed the motion on Thursday's agenda, hoping to remove Mashaba and Speaker Vasco da Gama from office. They claim that the city is on the brink of a financial collapse under their leadership.  DA leader Mmusi Maimane says that the ANC wants Mashaba removed as Joburg mayor simply to get a hold of the city’s cash. Maimane says Mashaba has changed the lives of residents around the city and it is evident that he’s doing something right. The DA has also acknowledged that coalitions are they only way to remove the ANC in some areas.
