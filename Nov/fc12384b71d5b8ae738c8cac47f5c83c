                                         DURBAN – Judgment has been reserved in the Pietermaritzburg High Court challenge by the so-called African National Congress (ANC) rebels. The KwaZulu-Natal ANC had applied for leave to appeal against the September judgment by the High Court, which declared the 2015 elective conference illegal. Lawyers representing ANC rebels argued that the party's constitution uses clear language to determine when a provincial conference should be convened. On the other hand, pro-Cyril Ramaphosa campaigners also applied for an execution order which would force the ANC provincial executive committee (PEC) to vacate the ANC’s offices in the province. Advocate Greg Harpur, who represented the provincial PEC, argued that the court has misinterpreted Clause 17 of the ANC’s Constitution. Harpur contended the ANC’s national executive committee is the highest decision-making body of the organisation and has the power to give its blessing for the 2015 conference to go ahead.  But senior counsel Wim Trengrove, who is represented the disgruntled ANC members, argued that there’s been a selective interpretation of that clause. Trengrove said not only was the four-year term of office rule not followed, but a third of the branches also never called for an early conference, maintaining that it remains unlawful.
