                                         HARARE - Four tanks were seen heading toward the Zimbabwe capital Harare on Tuesday, witnesses said, a day after the head of the armed forces said he was prepared to “step in” to end a purge of supporters of ousted vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. A Reuters witness saw two other tanks parked beside the main road from Harare to Chinhoyi, about 20km from the city. One of the tanks, which was pointed in the direction of the capital, had come off its tracks. Soldiers on the scene refused to talk to Reuters. In a move that highlighted the tensions rising in the southern African nation, General Constantine Chiwenga, commander of Zimbabwe Defence Forces said there was instability in Zanu-PF, which was causing anxiety in Zimbabwe. The army general said Zanu-PF had since 2015 been rocked by infighting, which had afflicted the economy, causing serious cash shortages and soaring prices of basic commodities. A video showing tanks on a Zimbabwean road is doing the rounds on social media. On the video, an unidentified man can be heard describing the situation in Zimbabwe. “About 10 tanks are on the highway heading to Harare and it appears more are on their way. These guys are not smiling at anyone. And clearly, they've got orders.” the man says.
