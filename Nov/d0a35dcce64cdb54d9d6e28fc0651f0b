Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says residents need to work with government and respect the water restrictions that have been put in place. JOHANNESBURG - Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says that government will do everything it can to prevent dam levels in the Western Cape from reaching zero percent. Mokonyane says that residents need to work with government and respect the water restrictions that have been put in place. The minister was speaking in Rosebank on Monday where she was outlining government’s plans for the upcoming water infrastructure investment summit later this month. The City of Cape Town is currently in phase one or preservation restrictions of its disaster plan which involves water rationing through limiting supply and advanced pressure management. Minister Mokonyane says that residents need to adhere to these restrictions. “We’ll only hit level zero if Capetonians and the people of the Western Cape do not adhere to water restrictions. “I appreciate the work that that’s been done by the City of Cape Town where they are now having means to even shut that which you’re wasting.” The province has been the hardest hit by the drought, with farm workers losing their jobs and rainfall not doing enough to end the crisis. Meanwhile, despite ongoing calls for residents to use water sparingly consumption in Cape Town has increased to 602 million litres per day. This is 102 million litres above the daily target. The Western Cape Local Government Department's James Brent-Styan says the Provincial Disaster Management Centre will now help manage the crisis.
