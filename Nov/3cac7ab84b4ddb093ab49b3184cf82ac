                                         DURBAN - With the African National Congress (ANC)'s Moses Mabhida Region reeling in shock at the deaths of two of its members, KwaZulu-Natal police say the motives behind the murders are still being investigated. On Thursday morning, ANC Youth League member Sthembiso Mhlongo was gunned down in his Howick home by unknown suspects. Mhlongo’s death follows the assassination of ANC's 34-year-old Lungisani Mnguni on Monday while conducting business in Camperdown. The ANC in the Moses Mabhida region says it does not want to speculate about the motives behind the murders. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele says no arrests have been made. “The motive of the killing is unknown at the moment but subject to an investigation. And the case of murder is investigated by Mpophomeni district at this moment.”
