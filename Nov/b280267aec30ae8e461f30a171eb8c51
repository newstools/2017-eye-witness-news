                                         CAPE TOWN - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the Post Office have been ordered to reach an agreement over the distribution of social grants by 17 November. An interministerial committee led by Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe told a joint parliamentary meeting on Wednesday morning that the government will move with speed to resolve the issue.  Earlier, it appeared that the impasse between the two parties had not been resolved. Radebe says that there’s a commitment to fast track an agreement between Sassa and the Post Office but what form that partnership will take, remains unknown. Briefing Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) and the Social Development Committee on Wednesday, Radebe says that a task team to be led by the Director-General of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation will oversee the process. "The mandate of the dedicated team will be to ensure the finalisation of the cooperation agreements between Sassa and Sapo, the governance and contracting framework, risk assessment and mitigation, monitoring and evaluation." The team will report weekly to the interministerial committee. Scopa says it wants to see the agreement reached by 21 November.
